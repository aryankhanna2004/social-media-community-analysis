I would go so far as to say he was my favorite part of the movie, which is saying a lot since its one of my all time favorites. Truly my Roman Empire.",

    "content": "I (34M) came home after work today, randomly flipping through TV channels, and Kuch kuch hota hai was playing. It was already halfway through the part where Rahul and Anjali meet again at the summer camp. I thought I’d just watch for 10 minutes since I’d seen it countless times back in college.\n\nBack then, I never really understood the emotional depth of it. Maybe because I was in a relationship then young, carefree and thinking love was forever. My ex got married a few years ago. It took me almost five years to really recover, to stop feeling that emptiness.\n\nBut tonight, somehow, watching that movie again… it hit differently. Ten minutes turned into watching the whole film. And honestly, I couldn’t hold back my tears.\n\nThat scene where they both see the falling star pretending they don’t believe in it anymore, yet silently closing their eyes and wishing that one moment shattered me. Because that’s exactly how it feels when two people who knew each other since their teenage years, who shared that unspoken connection, drift apart. Not because of fights or mistakes, but simply because of time.\n\nYou don’t just lose a person you lose the shared signs, the songs, the little things that belonged only to the two of you.\n\nI know it’s just a movie they made crores out of it but sometimes these films hit you in places you didn’t know still hurt. Maybe men don’t cry easily, but yeah… some movies do make our eyes wet too.\n\nThe movie had a happy ending. Mine didn’t. And that’s probably why it stings even more tonight.\n\nDo feelings really have that kind of power to pull you down even after you’ve given your heart completely and moved on (or at least thought you had?)\n",

    "title": "Of Jagga Jasoos and its (potential) nostalgic inspirations",
    "content": "I was only a kid when Satyajit Ray died. But I remember that Doordarshan played his movies as a tribute. And since the movies were late at night I wasn’t allowed to watch them, neither was I interested. But there was one movie that my parents gave me the permission to watch and it was “Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne”. And to this day this happens to be the only Ray movie I have watched. But the kid in me really loved the movie, for otherwise why would I still remember that experience even when I don’t remember a lot more of it. And this whole prelude was to just say that watching “Jagga Jasoos”, especially the first half, kind of awakened those subconscious memories for some reason. It could be the Bengal connection or the whole musical feel of it or the youthful fantastical adventures involved. The movie brought out the kid/youngster in me. The kid who loved Enid Blyton and Tintin's adventures. The youngster who loved Hitchcock's spy and mystery thrillers, and the Hollywood musical genre that I have always found fun and intriguing. I have always wondered why despite the rich musical and dance drama culture Indian movies have, we never tell stories through songs. And here comes a full on commercial Bollywood movie that does all that, that dares to experiment and do it quite well. I am impressed.\n\nI love \"Barfi\", and while I was disappointed when I discovered that some parts of the movie were plagiarized or inspired (however you see it), it is without doubt a proof of Anurag Basu's directorial skills, Ranbir's acting, Ravi Varman's cinematography and Pritam's music. And \"Jagga Jasoos\" is testimony to the fact that this team can pull off another gem without (hopefully) copying content from anywhere. I really really loved the boarding school portions and the sections shot in Manipur. I am sure the whole singing hero concept might have been the cause for this movie's failure, but that's exactly what worked for me. I can't find any failings in the first half of the movie other than probably Kartina's dialog delivery (and that too only in some sequences) and the realization that Ranbir as a 30 year old is playing a high schooler. Saswata Chatterjee and the kid were so cute. As a dad, I couldn't help but tear up.  The second half would have been great as well if they had kept it short. I loved the locations they chose for the movie and the whole setup. Was brilliant. Loved the songs as well - the Bollywood ones and that musical ones!\n\nComing the flaws, I think the movie suffered from the need to include stars. I am sure the movie would have worked so much better if we had actual young kids playing the protagonists. Maybe someone like Abhay Verma or maybe someone even younger. An adventure for teenagers perhaps. But I am sure that kind of movie will not get the funding needed. But other than the compromises they had to make for ensuring financial viability and for stretching the last act a bit too much, I wish people in Bollywood get back the guts to make movies from the heart that are technically brilliant and have a whiff of risk. We need more of those than factory made green screen adventures.",

At a time where movies glorify the dons and villains here it is which shows the good, the bad and the ugly of the Mumbai underworld.\n\nAlthough the movie is about Satya but the screen presence of Manoj just overshadows everyone. \n\nI haven’t seen much of Urmila but uffff she’s such a beauty. None of the actresses in the industry right now could match the charm she had in each frame.\n\nAs Bhiku mentions, J.D. (Satya) does gives glimpses of the angry young man Bachchan.\n\nI have heard “Sapne me milta hai” song countless times throughout my childhood. When I heard the song I assumed they are just using an existing bollywood song since the movie briefly delves into the Bollywood. But to my surprise the song is of Satya (TIL). \n\nI do wonder why we don’t make movies like these today. India still struggles with crime and criminals (politicians). There are plenty of stories or tragedies to tell. I feel the filmmaker’s have lost their spine and they only care about money. \n\nI am in my mid twenties and have recently started watching the 1990s- 2000s bollywood movies and I realised the movies (barring very few) do not stand anywhere close to the masterpieces that were produced in that time. And it tells a lot about where we are going as a society. \n\nPS - Mumbai ka KING kaunnnnn?",

Indian movies are designed this way that they build up a character to show them to be smart and they turn out to make the biggest mistake of their lives which eventually impacts their future self mentally.

I’ve noticed this in movies like Drishyam and Vash (Shaitaan). I feel that he struggles when the original movie’s actors deliver exceptional performances and become memorable for them. For instance, Bholaa flopped because Karthi’s performance was outstanding, and Devgn couldn’t match it. However, in Drishyam, he cast Tabu and Akshaye Khanna, who I believe did a better job than the original actors. The same can be said for Shaitaan and Maddy.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? ",

    "title": "Dhadak 2 Movie Review: A Beautiful Shell with an Empty Heart",
    "content": "Dhadak 2 (2025) is made as a bold sequel to the 2018 movie Dhadak, which itself was a remake of the Marathi hit Sairat. This time, director Shazia Iqbal remakes another powerful film, Mari Selvaraj’s Tamil masterpiece *Pariyerum Perumal*. But instead of keeping its power and honesty, Dhadak 2 turns it into a soft and polished Bollywood drama. The film looks beautiful from outside but feels empty from inside.\n\nThe story is about Neelesh Ahirwar (Siddhant Chaturvedi), a Dalit law student who gets admission in a top university through reservation. There, he meets Vidhi Bhardwaj (Triptii Dimri), a rich Brahmin girl. Their friendship turns into love, but society and Vidhi’s family refuse to accept their relationship because of caste. Neelesh faces insults, humiliation, and violence but slowly learns to fight back. The film tries to show caste realities mixed with a love story, but it fails badly in almost every way.\n\nThe biggest problem with Dhadak 2 is that it copies *Pariyerum Perumal* without understanding its heart. The Tamil film felt real and raw because it was based on true social realities. Dhadak 2, on the other hand, replaces that rawness with glossy sets, slow-motion shots, romantic songs, and pretty visuals. The result is a story that looks fake and distant. Bollywood again does what it often does polishing pain to make it look pretty. Songs like “Duniya Alag” and “Bas Ek Dhadak” sound emotional but take away the seriousness of caste violence. The film turns real suffering into something decorative. In *Pariyerum Perumal*, caste is the main subject and love is a way to show that injustice. In Dhadak 2, love is the main story and caste is treated as a small problem. That is the main difference, and the reason why this remake feels shallow.\n\nThe movie begins with a shocking scene a Dalit boy is killed by a contract killer. It sets a serious tone. But the very next scene, where Neelesh and Vidhi meet, feels like an old-fashioned Bollywood romance polished and overacted. This jump completely breaks the mood. As the story goes on, we keep seeing Neelesh getting bullied, insulted, and beaten. These scenes are supposed to make us feel his pain, but they are repeated so many times that the audience stops feeling sympathy. The film uses his suffering again and again but without purpose. One of the few real moments in the movie comes when Neelesh is arrested and his mother is slapped by the police. That short scene feels honest and real. But apart from this, most of the movie feels fake and forced. There is also a strange part where the college principal is shown as a Muslim man. This choice feels wrong because in real life, most institutions are run by upper-caste people. It shows that the director has not done enough research.\n\nSiddhant Chaturvedi tries hard as Neelesh. But his change from a shy boy to a confident man does not look natural because of poor writing. Triptii Dimri looks elegant as Vidhi, but her performance feels empty and lacks emotion. Their love story looks good on screen but does not touch the heart. Good actors like Harish Khanna, Zakir Hussain, and Saurabh Sachdeva are completely wasted. Their characters are flat and simple, even though they could have shown how caste works in higher education spaces. The only performance that feels true is by Vipin Sharma as Neelesh’s father. His small role feels powerful and real. Other than him, there are no moments that stay in the mind. Once the movie ends, nothing remains to think about.\n\nThe writing is the weakest part of Dhadak 2. The dialogues are dull and often sound childish. The movie drags, especially in the second half. The editing is rough and the scenes do not connect well. Director Shazia Iqbal seems to want to mix social message with romance, but she fails to do justice to either. Sometimes the movie feels like a love story, sometimes like a social film. This confusion runs throughout. Visually, the film looks very good. The lighting, camera work, and costumes are all perfect. But that becomes a problem too because the beauty of the visuals clashes with the dark subject of caste. The film ends up looking too clean to be believable.\n\nSeen from an Ambedkarite point of view, Dhadak 2 feels shallow and commercial. It uses Dalit pain as decoration, not as lived experience. Ambedkar taught that caste is not just discrimination it is a complete system that controls life, love, and education. The Tamil original understood this truth deeply. Dhadak 2 only copies its surface. Neelesh’s character is shown as helpless for too long. His political awakening, his self-respect, and his awareness as a Dalit man are missing. True Ambedkarite cinema should not only show suffering but also strength and resistance. Dhadak 2 fails to do that. Bollywood again takes a story of the oppressed and turns it into something safe and sellable. It wants to look socially aware without being truly political. It avoids questioning upper-caste privilege and guilt. In trying to be both brave and commercial, it becomes neither.\n\nDhadak 2 could have been a strong film about love and caste, a movie that carried Ambedkar’s message of equality and justice. But it ends up as a glossy, confused Bollywood drama pretending to be serious. The only good thing is that it brings the topic of caste into mainstream discussion. Bollywood has mostly ignored caste, so even this attempt is a small step forward. Maybe some young viewers will think about caste for the first time after watching it. But as a movie, it is weak, confused, and emotionally fake. For people who have seen *Pariyerum Perumal*, Dhadak 2 will feel like a poor imitation. For others, it may offer a few emotional moments, but nothing lasting. It lacks the courage, anger, and honesty that true Ambedkarite cinema needs. In short, Dhadak 2 is a beautiful mirror but with no reflection.\n\n**Rating: 1/5**",

    "content": "So this scene takes place right after Nandini gets hit on the head with a swing and bleeds out in a storage room and after the doctor treats her she tells the Family Radha was the one who told her that Avni was upstairs. \n\nIn the very same shot Avni is sitting on the bed near Nandini denying being there. She’s present in front of the entire family. Meanwhile Aditya calls Siddharth outside the room to discuss who the potential patient is. We see that even when they leave Avni is still in the room. \n\nNow considering they left before her, they obviously must have reached the bags outside in the courtyard before Avni could as she was still in the room with the family. \n\nSo who burnt Aditya’s bag while everyone was away? It couldn’t have been Avni taken over by Maunjulika as she would have an idea that it was too risky and it would be too difficult for her to make it undetected. It couldn’t have been during them saving Nandini from the storage room cause when Aditya and Siddharth rush to save her, Avni is shown coming out of from a shower with a towel on her head. Besides Avni didn’t know the bags belonged to Aditya so why would she burn them?\n\n",

    "content": "Last night, I was watching Singham on TV, and man, I was really enjoying it. That whole sequence where Singham takes down Jaykant Shikre’s gang with that badass BGM  pure madness. Then he drags the goons to the police station, Shiva Nayak shows up to rescue them, and Singham drops the line:\n\n“FIR kyu fhada?”\n\nPeak cinema moment 🔥\n\nAnyway, while watching, I started thinking about Inspector Rakesh Kadam’s son the one whose father committed suicide because of politics and corruption. That kid has a really strong backstory, and honestly, makers could make an entire movie just on him.\n\nSo… I wrote a concept 😅👇\n\n\n---\n\nPlot Idea:\n\nArjun Kadam (Vicky Kaushal), Rakesh Kadam’s son, grows up and joins the police force, mainly because his mother wants him to carry on his father’s legacy. But after joining, he starts hating the system, surrounded by corrupt officers and dirty politics. Still, he tries to do his duty.\n\nThen life hits him hard his mother dies of cancer, leaving him completely broken. He spirals into depression, turning to alcohol and drugs, living recklessly.\n\nOne night, while high, he visits a drug dealer to buy more drugs — only to find the dealer shot dead. Near the body, he sees his own service gun, which he had lost the night before at a bar. Panicked, he picks it up, and in his paranoid, drugged state, he kills someone who sees him holding the gun.\n\nHe cleans up the scene meticulously — removing bullets, taking the drugs, and leaving — then goes home to continue his high. Two days later, he wakes up hungover and receives a call from his station: a double murder has been reported. When he investigates, he realizes… he is the killer.\n\nTo cover himself, he requests to be assigned to the case. During the investigation, he discovers the existence of a serial killer — a complete psychopath who murders for pleasure. Slowly, the story turns into a battle between two broken minds: one killing for pleasure, the other collapsing under guilt and madness.\n\n\n---\n",

Tell me your opinions too. Films are ranked from top to bottom ( best to worst)\n\n1) WAR \\[Undoubtedly the best film of the spy universe. Great acting(even by tiger shroff) , Great swag(especially  Kabir's entry) and limited but banger songs. The story was nice, the action choreography and visuals were appealing and this film dosen't lets you get bored. The plot twists also worked for me and there are not too many twists, which is good. There is a love angle between Kabir and Naina, but this is not any random bullshit love angle just to extend the movie's length, it has a role in shaping the storyline. I personally feel that this movie can be at par with other hollywood films, but since it was a masala film, many of you would disagree with me on this. For me, this film was 9.5/10 \\]\n\n2) Tiger Zinda Hai \\[ This film ranked on number 2 might have some mixed opinions, but for me this was the greatest Tiger film. The action and visuals are top notch and the acting is also not bad. The side charecters don't particularly add depth to the storyline, but are fun to watch(specially Rakesh Ji). There is a very less love angle in this film, compared to other spy universe films which was great. I liked the songs of this film. The storyline is simple to decipher but the way it was been presented is just too good man. Tiger's swag(talking about the machine gun scene) has been fully utilised in this film. I thought to put this on number 1, but it is not at par with a legendary film like WAR , though this film is also a very solid film. The highlight of this film were its Grand action sequences. I would rate this 9/10.\n\n3) Ek tha Tiger \\[Keeping this one above Tiger 3 as this film focuses on a solid build up of story and serves justice to charecter development. I think that out of all Tiger films, this film actually focuses on its story properly. As such there are no grand action sequences in this movie, but considering that it was the first film of spy universe, it was a decent start. It dosen't let you get bored, but also dosen't let you gasp in aww. Love angle has a major part in shaping the storyline. Will rate this one 6.5/10\n\n4) Tiger 3 \\[A very mid film, especially after watching first two Tiger films. Decent vfx and action sequences, predictable as fuck storyline (vohi padosi mulk se dushmani) and same worn-out fights. Also, the cameo of SRK was a total waste. But still, it feels a bit entertaining than Pathaan and WAR 2. It felt that the writers were out of ideas, and just re-writing a generic af story that every other padosi mulk vs India film shows. Rating it 6/10 seems fine.\n\n5) Pathaan \\[I would have loved to congratulate this film with a wide range of gaalis in reviews, but considering this was the comeback film of SRK and a major bollywood masala film after lockdown, it seems fair to ignore its mid-ness. This film was literally so boring that I had to watch this in 3 parts to complete it. Bad vfx and logic-less action sequences are the main highlight of this film. ( I know ki masala films mei logic kaha hi hota hai, but jab koi cheeze itni atrociously buri hoti hai, toh aap usse nazarandaz nhi kar paate ho). Tiger's entry somewhat lifted the film a bit, but lendi toh lendi hoti hai na. Har previous spy film ka thodi thodi storyline ko mix karke yeh tatti movie banai hai. Bro, this one was actually boring man. Bas SRK ke stardom pe hi yeh Highest-Grossing YRF spy film ban pai hai(1055 crores inr worldwide). I think this one would get a rating of 3/10\\]\n\n6) WAR 2 \\[:( PURE CINEMA. Bhai yaar maa kasam theatre mei dekhne gaya tha is film ko aur rona nikal gya ki koi film itni vahiyaad kaise ho skati hai. Jitni achi WAR thi, utni hi kharab hai yeh. This film was a shitshow from the start,middle and end. 450 cr inr ke budget mei banai hui yeh bawasir ne sirf 371.26 cr inr kamaye. This film is so BORING and BAD that you start to feel ki Pathaan toh devmanus hai re. I literally feel asleep in the hall after 15 minutes. This film is the torch bearer for all the films with shitty vfx and action work. Literally yeh ek boat jo paani mei chal rhi hai usko kudwa kar ek live car racing track pe le aate hain. THIS ONE WAS BORING AF. Mera din kharab ho gya isse dekhne ke baad. IDK, how the fuck are some people still saying ki yeh film utni buri nhi hai. Bhai, ek baar NTR ki entry dekhna, tumhe samajh aa jayega itna gussa kyu aara hai mujhe is film par. Vohi love angle aur gaane, vohi dushman vs hero ki grand ladayi, vohi dono ki backstory,etc. 0.5 out of 10 (Just for Hrithik Roshan is film ko 0 nhi de rha hu).\\]\n\n",

    "content": "After a kaleshi Diwali, I was craving something lighthearted and thought of watching Bodyguard due to the nostalgia factor. I remember Ra.One and Bodyguard releasing around the same time in 2011 and all the kids in my building were mad about Ra.One, but Bodyguard did better at the BO. Nonetheless, here's my impression of the revisit.\n\nHonestly, I miss this Salman Khan so much...maza hi aa gaya to see bhoi like this. The action scenes were over the top and felt intentionally comical. Also, using a fat guy for comical purposes is so cliché in Bollywood. Body-shaming and homophobia used as comedy. Also spotted Asrani ji (RIP). I like Mahesh Manjrekar as a Bollywood villain. And oh gosh, Kareena looked like a dream (loved her kurtas and bangle stacking). Katrina's cameo and meta reference were cool. I like SK and Kareena's pairing usually (especially in Kyun Ki). The story was mid, but as I was looking for a no-brainer, I enjoyed it.\n\nMy takeaway? Kabhi Maaya jaisi dost mat banao.\n",

    "title": "Fixing War 2 and the YRF spy universe",
    "content": "War 2 was extremely underwhelming and the attempt to make sure that a major film star does not play a villain, they butchered the entire story. There was no connection to any other movies except a few scenes like Tiger shroff’s mom.\n\nHere’s a reimagined version that builds on the same world but adds realism, emotional stakes, and internal logic.\nThis version turns the Kabir–Raghu rivalry into a tragic brotherhood — something audiences could actually feel.\n\n⸻\n\n🧨 Opening Scene\n\nThe movie opens in Japan — Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) fights through a warehouse full of gangsters under flickering neon lights.\nAfter taking out the target, he meets his contact in Germany — but is drugged and abducted.\n\nHe wakes up in India, face-to-face with the Kali Cartel, a multi-national criminal syndicate with political reach.\nThey think they’re hiring a rogue mercenary.\n\nBut Kabir is undercover, part of a secret RAW mission designed by Colonel Sunil Luthra (Ashutosh Rana).\nHis assignment: infiltrate and dismantle the cartel from within.\n\n⸻\n\n🧒 Flashback: The Orphanage\n\nWe cut to 1999, Mumbai.\nA broken-down orphanage in the slums — where Kabir and Raghu grow up together.\nThey’re brothers not by blood, but by survival.\n\t•\tKabir is hopeful, kind, and a bit naïve — he believes life gives second chances.\n\t•\tRaghu is sharp, clever, and deeply aware of the world’s injustice — he doesn’t believe in luck, only control.\n\nThey get caught stealing food and are sent to juvenile detention. It’s there that Major Luthra first meets them — giving a speech about discipline and patriotism. He sees something in both of them and arranges for them to take recruitment tests when they turn 18.\n\n⸻\n\n🎖️ The Recruitment Tests\n\nBoth clear the physicals with ease. But the final psychological interview is where things diverge.\n\nLuthra asks Raghu one question:\n\n“If your country asks you to sacrifice your life for people who may never know your name, will you obey?”\n\nRaghu replies honestly —\n\n“I’ll obey… if they deserve saving.”\n\nIt’s not arrogance — it’s honesty born from hardship. Luthra sees that Raghu’s realism could make him unpredictable.\nHe tells him quietly:\n\n“You’re sharp, son. But the system needs loyalty before logic.”\n\nKabir answers the same question later:\n\n“If they don’t know my name, that means I did my job right.”\n\nKabir is chosen. Raghu congratulates him with a smile, but his eyes betray something else — not jealousy, but realization.\nHe understands that the system rewards obedience over truth.\n\nThat night, Raghu sneaks out of the orphanage, disappearing into Mumbai’s darkness.\n\n⸻\n\n🛩️ Kabir’s Journey\n\nKabir joins the Air Force.\nHe meets Kavya (Kiara Advani) during training — fearless, smart, and fiercely patriotic. They start as competitors and slowly fall in love.\n\nLuthra notices Kabir’s potential and takes him under his wing, training him off the books — advanced combat, covert ops, psychological warfare.\nIt’s here that Luthra introduces him to RAW’s existence, telling him about legendary agents like Pathaan and Tiger.\n\nDuring one of these sessions, a new cadet joins the program — Jim (John Abraham).\nJim and Kabir develop a healthy rivalry — two soldiers with contrasting philosophies.\n\t•\tKabir believes in protecting.\n\t•\tJim believes in winning.\n\nLuthra’s mentorship binds them both, saying,\n\n“The future of this country will be in your hands someday — one through faith, the other through fire.”\n\nThat single line plants the seeds for Pathaan and War’s timeline crossover.\n\n⸻\n\n💀 Raghu’s Descent\n\nMeanwhile, Raghu hustles on the streets — working odd jobs for smugglers, eventually getting involved with small-time arms dealers.\nHe learns how power works — not through laws, but leverage.\n\nHis intelligence draws the attention of a mysterious handler — Bobby Deol (the same man who later appears in Alpha).\nBobby trains him in the art of manipulation and covert warfare.\nHe teaches Raghu to weaponize his intellect.\n\nUnder Bobby’s guidance, Raghu crafts a new identity: Kali.\nClever, composed, and ruthless — he forms the Kali Cartel, a multinational syndicate that uses crime to influence governments.\n\nBut unlike typical villains, Kali isn’t evil for greed.\nHe genuinely believes he’s fixing the world.\nHe sees systems as corrupt and believes control is the only cure.\n\nEvery decision he makes is a mirror image of Kabir’s — the two took different paths to fight the same injustice.\n\n⸻\n\n⚔️ The Present\n\nYears later, Kabir’s public “rogue” image from War (2019) was a planned cover orchestrated by Luthra.\nThe plan: get close to the cartel’s inner circle.\n\nThe test: kill Luthra himself.\n\nKabir does it — on camera.\nRAW brands him a traitor.\nBut what no one knows is that Luthra survives, rescued by Dimple Kapadia’s character (from Pathaan), who hides him in a covert facility — India’s answer to Nick Fury’s network.\n\n⸻\n\n🚨 The Manhunt\n\nRAW launches an international manhunt led by Kavya, now one of RAW’s top agents.\nUnder political pressure, Defence Minister Sarang adds Vikrant Kaul to the mission.\n\nMeanwhile, Kali (Raghu) begins collaborating with intelligence agencies — RAW, CIA, MI6 — playing both sides.\nHe infiltrates the Kabir hunt himself, pretending to help capture the rogue agent.\n\nThroughout the middle act, Kabir and Kali keep encountering each other under aliases — unaware of their shared past.\nSpain. Yemen. Italy. Each mission blurs the line between hunter and hunted.\n\nTheir fighting styles echo their ideologies — Kabir fights to protect, Kali to dominate.\n\n⸻\n\n💣 The Revelation\n\nKabir and Kavya uncover that Defence Minister Sarang is secretly aligned with the Kali Cartel.\nHis endgame: assassinate the Prime Minister and destabilize India.\n\nAt the World Economic Forum in Davos, the plan unfolds.\nKabir intercepts the attack — only to discover the real orchestrator is Kali.\n\nThe shock hits like lightning.\nThe friend he lost. The ghost he’s been chasing. The monster the world fears.\n\nIt’s Raghu.\n\n⸻\n\n❄️ Final Face-Off\n\nThe final act takes place in a snowbound Swiss ice cavern.\nRaghu, cornered, argues that everything he’s done was to bring balance.\n\nRaghu:\n\n“You wanted to serve a country that doesn’t even serve its people. I wanted to rebuild it — from the shadows.”\n\nKabir replies:\n\n“If the shadows rebuild it, there won’t be any light left to live in.”\n\nThey fight — raw, brutal, emotional.\nKabir defeats Raghu but can’t kill him.\nRaghu escapes, injured and broken, leaving Kabir to collapse in the snow — rescued by Kavya moments later.\n\n⸻\n\n🕶️ Epilogue\n\nMonths later, Kabir learns that Luthra is alive, hidden in Dimple Kapadia’s network.\nThe Kali Cartel has fractured, but pieces of it are being repurposed by the government into a secret black-ops initiative: Project Alpha.\n\nPost-Credits Scene:\nA mysterious man tattoos the Greek letter α on a young recruit’s arm — the beginning of Project Alpha.\nBobby Deol watches from the shadows.\n\nKabir, somewhere in the Himalayas, looks at the horizon and whispers:\n\n“If he’s alive… I’ll find him.”\n",

The internet won’t forget this one. She’s on such a roll right now.\n\n2. Rohit Saraf’s journey from Dear Zindagi, Mismatched to now, really shows.\n\n3. That Rohit Saraf entry😍? Pure theatre moment.\n\n4. And Dimple &amp; Rishi’s wedding crossover!!! Love it... Unexpected but fun.\n\n5. Varun Dhawan’s consistency deserves a real shoutout. From Student of the Year to Badlapur to Sui Dhaaga, it’s been 13 years, huh! Still delivering with the same energy and drive. I think following Rishi Kapoor’s advice, using less hair gel, that works for him (not just SOTY).\n\n6. Janhvi Kapoor 🫰🏻from Dhadak, Nadiyon Par to Gunjan Saxena, Mili, Devara, Homebound and Many, she’s proven she’s more than just glamour.\n\n7. Nice to see Maniesh Paul back, and Abhinav Sharma (Mismatched) too.\n\n8. As an Arijit Singh fan, that recreated car scene cracked me up, god.. cool cameo nod to the originals btw.\n\n9. Personally, didn’t vibe with the Bijuria version, loved the Homebound cast's reel though, but... Panwadi? Instant hit, I’m still humming the song, quirky, fun, full Dharma-vibe...\n\n10. Writing could’ve been sharper, but let’s be honest for a second, we’ve seen far worse in Bollywood. It’s not a disaster.\n\n11. Tu Hai Meri is another solid track.🫰🏻\n\n✨Good films happen when people create more and complain less.\n\nWhat do you think?",

He is such a good example of how actor is an actor give them good material and if they are good enough they will shine. This was my second RGV movie marathon right after Company, these movies makes me wonder what really happened. RGVs hold on screenplay and writing is so tight that not a single moment feel dull. Though the movie is longer than required it is by no means boring, hope we get RGV comeback asap. To sum it up, this truly is one of the best RGV ventures and yes Ritesh Deshmukh in serious roles is treat. Do give it a chance, you won't regret.

    "content": "Just rewatched Tiger 3 so that i can properly judge this movie cuz i barely remembered it. \n\nThe movie had good written characters and the overall story had good potential but i feel I feel like Salmaan didn’t act upto his potential for me to connect to Tiger. He cried when he thought Zoya was betraying him but then he didn’t plead to Aatish (Emraan Hashmi) for literally threatening his son. Even when Hassan sacrifices himself, for a second it seems like he is in shock but it’s later revealed that when his son like figure blasted himself to save him (completely unnecessary btw) he just fell and told Zoya with a straight face to go help the PM. I get tha he needs to have calculated decisions but atleast show him grieving someone. The guy’s child is kidnapped and he can’t stop using dialogues to make him look strong. The trailer shows the Tiger will suffer and be put on his knees and everything is at risk for him but we barely see him suffer. Like seriously you can’t ever be a 100% sure which emotion Salman is trying to show and you can’t tell me it’s how the character is because that’s his face in every movie recently. I love how Salman can act, I love his talent but recently I feel like he is not using it to his fullest potential. If he did, this movie would’ve been a lot better. Zoya, again a well written character but Katrina’s acting doesn’t really fit well. This is one of the rare movies that have such a good story that you feel with the story regardless of who plays the character. I loved Tiger Zinda Hai and Zoya’s role in that movie as well but it feels like even she hasn’t put in that effort for some reason. The other characters were good but then comes Emraan Hashmi. As much as you can tell me that he isn’t made to play the villain, this man gave his everything to that role and it shows. The show of power, fear, commanding, he gave his entire effort even though he isn’t made for a villian role. After watching this and Pathaan, I was about to say that the villains of YRF Spy Universe are well written but lol, we have watched War 2 and Kalki was such a disappointment, I’m gonna have a separate post on a War 2 re-write soon.",

The writing, the performances, the pacing and all is really great .\n\nBut man, the setting just kept pulling me out of it. The film is clearly shot in Ooty and Coonoor, with those old colonial bungalows, misty hills, and narrow winding roads — very distinctly South Indian hills in both architecture and vibe. Yet the family is fully North Indian, everyone’s a Kapoor or Sharma, and the culture, food, accents, even the social interactions are pure North India. \n\nIt feels jarring \n\nlike these people just got air dropped into a totally different ecosystem. If they had just said it’s Dehradun or Mussoorie or some “hill station near Chandigarh,” it would’ve worked fine. But shooting it in Ooty and pretending it’s a North Indian town breaks the illusion.\n\nIt’s like shooting a movie in Lucknow but pretending it’s Bangalore  the language, the houses, the trees, even the way people dress are completely different. You can’t unsee it.\n\nI get that Ooty is a filmmaker’s paradise pretty, quiet, great lighting but here it just clashes tonally. The story feels grounded in middle-class North Indian family dynamics, while the visuals belong to an Anglo-colonial hill station in the Nilgiris.\n\nStill a lovely film overall, but the location choice feels like a rare misstep in an otherwise perfectly calibrated movie.\n\nDid anyone else notice this weird dissonance or am I overthinking it?",

Overtime, audience grew intelligent and for the sake of honesty started giving credit to the original works as in Laal singh chadda for Forrest Gump, but it always felt forced to me. After such series of Ctrl+V movies, stories and looks going on in the Bollywood. Here what i think is another upcoming mediocre (unofficial) copy of the western story. And this time, they got creative, instead of copying a movie, they copied a Game. Lets see where this movie goes, but i can bet, this will be not be a SRK centric movie but another attempt at launching Suhana Khan as a powerful female character, who goes on a transformative journey with a father figure, who is apparently her biological dad(which is actually the core story of The Last of Us game).\n\nLets see what we get.\n\nP.S. these are just speculations, the whole movie might me completely different.",

Both were adapted from the works of Munshi Premchand.\nShatranj Ke Khilari is a period piece about how the British conquered Awadh and the end of Mughal rule in India. The film portrays Indians as ignorant and, to some extent, complicit in their own colonization. It beautifully captures the essence of a bygone era — its art, music, and culture — much of which was lost after India’s colonization. Like all of Ray’s films, it is brilliantly directed with humor and subtlety. All the actors deliver fine performances, especially Amjad Khan as Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. Overall, if you love slow, artistic cinema, you will love Shatranj Ke Khilari.\nOn the other hand, Sadgati is a much angrier film about Dalit exploitation. It directly attacks the casteism that still prevails in modern India. Om Puri gives one of his best performances in this powerful film.",

Amitabh ruled the 70s and 80s — his “Angry Young Man” image made him a national hero. But Shah Rukh came in the 90s when India was changing, and he didn’t just rule Bollywood he made it global.\n\nHe had no film background, yet became the face of Indian cinema worldwide. People in countries that don’t even speak Hindi know him. That kind of fame is rare.\n\nWhat’s crazy is how long he’s stayed relevant over 30 years in the industry and still breaking records with movies like Pathaan and Jawan. That’s not just stardom, that’s legacy.\n\nSo yeah, while Dilip Kumar was the best actor of his time and Amitabh was the biggest star of his era, I honestly think Shah Rukh Khan is the most complete superstar India’s ever had.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Who was the bigger star in their peak — Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, or Shah Rukh Khan?",

    "content": "(Some points here come from TRP's latest unpopular opinions vid so thought I'd mention it)\n\nI recently saw a news article talking about Ahaan Pandey and the sensation he has become worldwide. One thing particularly struck me - a statement along the lines of \"Only time will tell whether ahaan will become a commercial star and deliver another blockbuster\" And it struck me - this is what we expect from our stars now. \n\nWe don't want them to choose films that align with their passion and interests, we don't want them to make compelling cinema, we don't even want to star in decent films. All the media wants is for the star to deliver another commercial hits, otherwise they'll be called a \"flop actor\" immediately. \n\nLook at the negative press around amitabh bachchan when he was first launched. The environment just wont let big names go into content driven films. Look at how no media outlet talks about the mediocrity of Varun Dhawan's projects but only about the fact that they weren't \"clean hits\".\n\nAt the other end, look at how non judgmental hollywood media is in this aspect (I know hollywood is not perfect, just comparing this aspect). Look at emily blunt - an actress who headlined a 900 million dollar oscar nominated blockbuster in 2023 has had 2 consequtive flops (and pretty big ones at that), yet no outlet has called her a flop actress. Joaquin Pheonix delivered a billion dollar hit in 2019 with Joker, but has since had 4 financial diseasters, yet all of it is praise for him. And we still blame Varun for Baby John's flop.\n\n(I know my points are a bit naive but still)",

    "content": " A note to blind haters:\n\nI totally agree the movie was just an amalgamation of multiple scenes from both Indian and Hollywood industries stiched together. The storyline is tried and tested age old vigilante flick and succeeded at inspiring/motivating nobody. My request is simply that you provide some novel points to hate on this movie. Also, I'm an srk fan (not the biggest, but still a fan)\n\nThis post is not a review of the movie itself, but rather what I experienced in theatres.\n\n.......................................\n\nAs someone who is already sick of the dogs howling in my street, and someone who only dances when there is a cockroach up their pants, first day show was out of the question. I loved the trailer though, and had made up my mind to watch it in theatres. If that wasn't enough, hardly anyone on YouTube had called it 'average' or below. It was after 2 weeks that I got my tickets (not that tickets weren't available. I tried in vain to convince my crush to come along... Story for another day).\n\n......................................\n\nThe opening scene was mesmerizing - the color schemes, the background score, the action sequence and close up of srk's eyes. Everything felt perfect. And the audience couldn't stop cheering and shouting. I couldn't stop myself from whistling, only to realise that putting your tongue on your index finger doesn't generate any sound.\n\nThis was followed by a dead silence during the hijack scene, feeling helpless listening to the plight of the farmer's daughter.\n\nAnd then, the interval block. That's the memory a carry to this day. There were claps, there were whistles and there was dance. A reassurance of sorts that srk still owns the thrown. That people love this man, irrespective of what age, character, or genre he plays.\n\n...............................\n\nThere were plotholes, there were copies and there was the butchering of my beloved physics. But there also was ENTERTAINMENT. A whole bucket load of it. While I expected such an electrifying environment, never would I have thought that it would sustain after 2 weeks of release.\n\nAnd obviously, the VFX, color grading and score is what made it a terrific theatre experience.",

You can never plan this kind of thing. I tried to imitate in *Hamari Adhuri Kahaani* (2015), it doesn't come across.”\n\nMohit Suri then confirmed that he is in talks with Yash Raj Films for one more film, “To be honest, we are planning to do a film together again. When I met them again, I said, 'This is a newer set of audience that is coming up to me. I have never had 60-year-old aunties telling me, *'Beta, jeete raho. Bahut acchi* picture *banayi'* (laughs). I only know the guy who comes up and beats his chest. I have done that in my previous films.

The reactions around were priceless — half the bus pretended not to look, and the other half definitely looked but acted like they weren’t. 😅\n\nIt got me thinking how wild it is that such scenes were considered too much back then, but now they feel more symbolic than sensual. Still, for 80s Bollywood, that was a daring move.\n\nAnyway, this was just one of those random, funny moments from my solo backpacking trip across North &amp; North East India — no fixed plans, just vibes and buses with unexpected movie screenings. 🌏✨\n\nNext stop: probably Kolkata or somewhere around Jharkhand before I head towards the North East!",

Ours is a more massy film because it penetrates into the Hindi-speaking markets as well. *Lokah* could be a good induction for certain multiplex audiences, but we have a different genesis, different situations — it’s a different story. There are hardly any similarities.” \n\nCo-star Rashmika Mandanna also weighed in, noting that she is friends with Kalyani Priyadarshan and has watched *Lokah*. “Having DQ (Dulquer Salmaan), Thomas (Tovino), and Kalyani just doing their thing, it was a different world altogether,” she said. “Knowing what we have in store and where we’re coming from, I can promise it’s going to be a different experience. You can’t put both films together. I understand where the comparisons are coming from, but once you walk out of *Thamma*, it will spark a whole new conversation.”",

Others think it’s just designer melodrama wrapped in nostalgia.  \nPersonally, I think it’s the most quotable emotional rollercoaster Bollywood ever made.\n\nSo what’s your take?

    "content": "I just finished re watching Pathaan because back when it came out, I didn’t pay much attention into critiquing movies at all. \nBefore I begin, I always try to be unbiased on actors, and other reviews so that my view is fresh. \n\nThe story felt predictable, and the twist on the Deepika’s character felt like a desperate attempt to shock the audience because 10 minutes later they are working together again. I feel like the antagonist (John Abraham) was written so well that they forgot to focus on other aspects. Action movies are supposed to play with the bounds of physics stretching it thin to a point where you can assume that the character is so capable that they are able to do what they did, but it requires proper acting and visual skill to make it believe, that lacked many places in the movie. The action sequences felt a bit under-written, especially for a high budget spy-thriller. Just because you have big explosions and gunfights, doesn’t mean hand to hand combat doesn’t matter, in fact that’s the one thing that can even save a bad written movie.\n\nNow, the good part. I want to thoroughly praise John Abraham but let’s begin with smaller things. The connectivity of the movie was good (referring to connecting it to the larger YRF Spy Universe) and even though Tiger’s cameo felt a bit too soon for a early building universe, i’d be lying if i said that action sequence wasn’t well written, actually good, and fun to watch. Now comes John Abraham. That charcacter was not only a really good written character but the execution was flawless. One of the best if not the best performances John Abraham has ever done. There’s a point in the movie where you might lose connection with SRK but you’ll still feel every emotion Jim is feeling through his eyes. I was genuinely hurt when Pathaan takes Jim’s Bravery Medal as he supposedly dies (please come back). This movie made me fall in love with John Abraham all over again, not kidding.\nI hope he returns in War 2… oh wait, lol. Well, Maybe War 3? \n\nI would rate this movie 6.5/10",

It’s not a very high concept film, but it has strong storytelling and is beautifully shot. Arjun Rampal's best performances in my opinion. The film won National Awards for Cinematography and Audiography.\n\n “Jaanlewa” is an absolute banger.\n\nI think it was a really good movie.\n",

    "content": "As a kid, I was tormented to no end by India’s Most Wanted — and specifically by the UP don Shri Prakash Shukla, for some reason. I recently looked him up online and decided to watch Sehar, a film loosely based on his life. It has a decent 7.7 rating on IMDb and features Arshad Warsi, Mahima Chaudhary, Pankaj Kapur, and Sushant Singh.\n\nI felt the director’s heart was in the right place, but he seemed trapped in the early-2000s Bollywood trope — which kept the movie from feeling as raw and real as Black Friday still does today. Mahima Chaudhary’s character felt completely unnecessary given her weak arc, and most of the other characters lacked depth too.\n\nA valiant attempt by the director and cast, but for me, it’s a 5/10. The film had real promise — it just didn’t quite deliver.",

    "content": "These are the themes they have milked so far:\n\n**Ramayan and Mahabharat:** Most family movies of the 80s and early 90s revolved around these two epics.  \nAnd not only that — they even distorted the original scriptural *Ramayan* and *Mahabharat* to fit a Bollywood-style narrative where Indra is the villain, Narad Muni is a comic character, and the rest of the gods speak overly emotional dialogues.\n\nThen came the era of exaggerated romance, where actors and actresses could never get married easily.  \nAfter that, they turned to gangster movies.  \nAnd finally, they started making films based on real incidents.\n\nWith such limitations, you can create one, two, or even a few dozen movies. However, making it a *central theme* is an entirely different challenge.\n\nThey have normalized fair skin tones, mediocre dialogues, and shallow comedy.  \nThey neither invest in high-quality animation or CGI nor in a strong storyline.\n\nIndia is the land of stories — yet they consistently fail to infuse Indianism into their movies or storytelling.\n\nSaale Bollywood actors/actresses don't even look Indian anymore with all that surgery and cosmetics.\n\n# Why?",

Both BOMBED.\n\n*Tamasha* had massive expectations, RK-Imtiaz coming after Rockstar and RK-DP coming after YJHD, with Deepika being at her peak at that time. Didn't work. Tho it has attained a cult following over the years.\n\n*Ae Dil Hai Mushkil*, while a success commercially, also didn't live upto expectations. \n\n*Jagga Jasoos* was meant to be another banger from RK-Basu, but wasn't(even though Ranbir left no stone unturned to give a great performance).\n\n*Sanju* was a blockbuster but it also had Hirani at his peak, and back then he was the biggest brand among directors. Though, it did give RK a boost, like YJHD.\n\n*Shamshera* and *Brahmāstra* had massive expectations. Were poised to finally cement Ranbir as the new SUPERSTAR but they just couldn't, even though Brahmāstra had a good initial. Both didn't break even and were panned critically.\n\nIt was with *Animal* that he finally became a part of the big leagues. Now his lineup is STACKED. But those choices seem a bit off, considering they're there strictly for the box office. Hopefully, Ranbir THE ACTOR doesn't get suppressed by Ranbir THE STAR(something which happened with the likes of SRK too).",

His ability to excel in comedy, action, and drama makes him a compelling choice.\n\nHowever, Ajay Devgn's intense performances in films like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and Omkara are hard to forget.

However, I can't really say the same for Kriti. I can't think of any of her pairings that gave strong chemistry as much as his pairings have.

    "title": "Saiyaara movie: my review",
    "content": "Movie: Saiyaara (2025)\nGenre: Romance \nReview Score: You will enjoy it if you are hopeless romantic type \n\nI know I am late to the party, just watched this on Netflix. Since I liked the movie, I only wrote about the parts I liked. \n\nHistorically, not only Bollywood but the world cinema actually, wants you to be in love with the concept of love..And this in turn has created some great pieces of rom-com/rom-dramas. And I can name countless best movies ever made in the name of love, and it still won't be enough, because really, for each one of us has their own best stories they like. All of this to say..Saiyaara is now one of such love stories I like about love!\n\nBefore you tell me how big of cringe fest it was or you just hate it, let me tell you: it's fine if you don't like it. But I do think it's for you: if you are hopeless romantic type or if you have experienced that magic of love with that special someone, through thick and thin and even ugly side of life. Just keep your mind open about it and give it a chance, if you haven't watched it yet.\n\nSo what's Saiyaara is about? It's tale as old as time, and see if your favorite story fits the description: two souls maybe with traumatic past - fall for each other - but tragedy hits their love story - so they leave each other - only to reunite again against all odds. \n\nAnd the movie culminates with what the great Ted Mosby said about love:  \"If you're looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want no matter how much it destroys you, it's LOVE. And when you love someone you don't stop, ever\". This! This is what the movie is about: Even though her Alzheimer's disease will ruin her life in the end, Vani wants Krish to have everything he wants from life (He does mention he wants to be famous and rich, unlike his father), and she knows if she sticks around it's only going to mess up with his head no matter how understanding/mature he stays. And Krish thinks no matter the cost to his career, he wants Vani to have all that love, all those special moments from life that she deserves. \n\nThe movie encapsulates that feeling: The one you get when you see your love standing against the world alone with his/her all strength, and it's just crushes you to see them alone and suddenly you become: f**k everything, I don't care, I am with you till the end. \n\nMovie opens beautifully with Vani' trauma: she's been left at the alter and this becomes her emotional baggage and she starts dying a little everyday (Movie shows this as she is not being able to write new things and she's ripping pages of her writing). \n\nThen she meets Krish, (initial scenes show her infatuation with him) and opposites attracts! Here she was, an introvert (movie talks about this later) dragging through her life with bottled up pain, losing bits of her slowly and suddenly this guy, a raw soul and an extrovert, swoops in, shows her how to live in a moment again despite having his own emotional baggage. This contrast is what makes her fall for him, and she starts believing that she can have normal life again. \n\nAnd I must talk about obvious, the musical fusion: the scenes, the lyrics, the music goes so much together (rare in movies these days) that it just melts your heart. Like humsafar song: Vani starts healing and falling for him, also starts writing again and song has few lines to highlight this: धीरे-धीरे तू मेरे लफ़्ज़ों में आया है, तुझको ही तो चुपके से मन में लाया है and ये मान ले, चाहत दुनिया में सबसे, बेहतर मरहम है, यारा. Same with the scene at the start of Barbaad song: Krish believes he is no good for Vani and wants to stay away, so much that he believes he might admit his love for her, if he feels her touch again. So in that crowd, he stays put, not moving towards her, while lyrics goes: तुझे छू लू तो कुछ मुझे हो जाएगा\nजो मैं चाहता न हो मुझको. For me this is like a symphony so beautiful.. I have no words 😶. \n\nOkay, I agree,too long. So that's it, review over!",

I rarely binge watch shows (Only did it twice - “Yeh kaali kaali ankhen S1” and “Black, White &amp; Gray - Love Kills” ), but I couldn’t stop myself from bingeing on this.\n\n2. Acting: All of the cast performed exceptionally well. Raghav Juyal and Manoj Pahwa were the standouts for me. Also, shoutout to the guy playing Saher’s brother Shoumik/Shouvik.\n\n3. Make-up and aesthetics : Saher Bamba looked breathtaking. Just wow. Lakshya too looked quite convincing as the lead actor. Anya Singh truly has a beautiful pair of eyes.\n\n4. Direction: apart from a few hiccups here and there, it was a pretty good show, particularly for a debutant director. Though I don’t know if Aryan actually directed it fully himself or there were some ghost directors involved to help him.\n\n5. Music: It was good, especially “Mainu ki pata” song (Diljit Dosanjh) and that Anirudh song (badli si hawa hai). However it’s the BGM that added a unique layer to the characters - eg the “Ghafoor” music whenever Arshad Warsi was on screen was funny lol\n\n6. Story: This thing had many logical-gaps. I was expecting it to be a bit more believable, but thik hai, IG I should’ve known that it was bound to have a typical Bollywood plot-line after all\n\n7. Some funny/memorable things:\n\na) Raghav’s Tamalli muaan attempt\n\nb) When Anya Singh asked Lakshya “kaisa hai?” (in the final few minutes of the last episode), Raghav replied “Poori industry ne boycott kar diya hai,\nBhabhi behen nikli\nAur do baap ka hai - kaisa hoga?”) lol\n\nc) The cameos: particularly SRK’s, Ranbir’s, and Badshah’s were funny. “Ghante ka badshah” haha\n\nOverall rating: I’m confused between 7.75 and 8, but I’ll go with the latter. So an 8/10 from me. \nMaza aaya🥳\n",

But if you watch the movie closely, the real emotional and philosophical weight of the film rests on Ajay Devgn’s shoulders.\n\nVanraj carries the second half, his sacrifices, his quiet support, and the moral core of the story make him the one who truly drives the film’s message. By the end, when Nandini chooses him, it’s clear that the film’s heart belongs to him, not Sameer.\n\nSo while Salman might be the face and the initial hero, I genuinely feel that Ajay Devgn is the main lead if you look deeper.\n\nWould love to hear if others felt the same way.\n",

    "title": "Jab harry met sejal (JHMS)... here's a little rewrite | though I love the original too",
    "content": "So we all know this film was panned all over the place with bad reviews when it released. Reviews stated, it was aimless and plot lacked the emotional depth. Characters felt underdeveloped and a major criticism was Imtiaz Ali reusing themes of soul-searching journey. And the ring searching wasn't a logical reason to build plot upon. In my opinion the film was never about the ring. Ring was just a tool for Harry and Sejal to come togather, nothing else. Here's the rewrite:\n\nThe film opens much like the original, but instead of random tourists, we see Harry guiding Sejal’s group across Europe as “Safar” plays in the background. The montage intercuts shots of a weary, melancholic Harry with scenes from Sejal’s engagement ceremony — where it’s clear she too is unhappy. Her smile doesn’t reach her eyes, and we subtly sense her powerlessness. Her family is pushing the marriage to benefit from her fiancé’s father’s business influence. (Also, Sejal doesn’t have that forced accent here — it adds nothing and feels unnecessary.)\n\n\nThe story then proceeds similarly to the original. After losing her engagement ring, Sejal insists on finding it before returning to India. Her family reluctantly agrees — but only if Harry, her tour guide, helps her. Harry’s boss pressures him into taking the job, though Harry warns Sejal upfront: he doesn’t have the best reputation with women.\nThe playful dynamic between them begins — Sejal teasingly trying to charm him, following him into the nightclub, leading to the “Harry to kutta bhonkta hega” chase scene.\n\n\nBefore the “Radha” song, we introduce a new layer to Harry’s character. One night, he opens up to Sejal — about his past in Punjab. Once, he dreamt of becoming a singer. He wrote songs for a girl he loved deeply, but their relationship was torn apart by caste barriers. The elders intervened — either marrying her off or worse, killing her. Heartbroken, Harry left for Canada to chase his musical dreams, but that too collapsed. Now, emotionally adrift, he works as a tour guide in Europe. He drifts from woman to woman, unable to form real connections, haunted by his first love and his own failures.\n\n\nAfter a few failed attempts to “find” the ring, it’s revealed — though not as a twist — that Sejal has always known the ring was in her purse. The “lost ring” was never truly lost; it was her excuse to run away from her family and postpone the marriage. Her family, aware of her hesitancy, allowed her to stay behind under one condition: she can remain only if Harry helps her find the ring.\nGone is the unnecessary “Bangladeshi don in Portugal” subplot. Instead, we follow Harry and Sejal traveling across Europe, searching for the ring as “Phurr” plays in the background. Their banter continues — playful yet intimate — until one day, Harry confronts her:\n“Tereko koi ring-wing nahi dhundhni. I know tujhe shaadi nahi karni hai. Tu bas apni sacchai se bhaag rahi hai — meri tarah.”\n\n\nCaught off guard, Sejal sees through Harry’s words — he understands her better than anyone else ever has. This realization draws her closer to him. As “Hawayein” plays, we watch their connection deepen — a quiet, growing love shadowed by Harry’s inner fear: “Iski aadat nahi padni chahiye.” He knows this love is real — and that’s exactly why it terrifies him.\n\n\nLater, Harry and Sejal attend the wedding of another tour guide (Hiren), where “Raula” plays. During preparations, Harry accidentally finds the ring in Sejal’s purse. Realizing the truth, he quietly books her ticket back home.\nThat night, before leaving, Sejal confesses her feelings and offers herself to him. But Harry gently refuses.\n\n“You’re special. I won’t be with you like the others. If I ever love you, it won’t be hidden — it’ll be out in the open, for the world to see. Not something secret or forbidden.”\n\nThe next morning, Sejal returns to India. “Ghar” plays as both of them go through their days, missing each other — their absence heavy, their emotions unspoken.\n\nTime passes after Sejal leaves. Harry returns to his usual tours, smiling for the crowds, laughing for tips — but inside, he’s a shell. Every city, every sunset, every song reminds him of her.\nHe thinks of calling her countless times. His fingers hover over her name on the screen… but he never presses dial.“She must be happy,” he tells himself. “Why disturb her peace?”\n\nThen, one day, an envelope arrives — a wedding invitation. Her handwriting on the front makes his heart stop. Sejal is inviting him to her fiancé’s wedding. He stares at it for a long while, unsure what to feel.\n\nHis friend warns him not to go.\n“Mat jaa, Harry. Kya karega jaake?\" But Harry goes anyway. Cut to: an extravagant wedding venue in Gujarat, bathed in warm lights and music. Harry steps in quietly, scanning the crowd, unsure if he belongs here. And then — he sees her. Sejal. Dressed simply, standing in the garden just outside the main hall, the noise of celebration fading behind her.\nShe turns, sensing him. For a moment, she’s stunned — then she smiles softly.“I didn’t think you’d come,” she says, a little breathless.\nHe glances toward the hall, where her ex-fiancé is laughing with guests, garland in hand. “So… you really came to his wedding? \". Sejal looks at him, her expression calm but wistful. “I had to. I wanted to know if I’d feel anything. I didn’t.”\nHarry steps closer. There’s pain in his eyes — but also relief. “And now?” he asks quietly. “Now I know what I want,” she whispers. For a long beat, they just look at each other — the lights flickering between them, the music faint in the distance. Then she takes a step forward.\n“You once said if you ever loved me, it would be for the world to see.”\nHarry breathes in, eyes never leaving hers. “Then let them see.”\nHe leans in, and they kiss — slow, aching, and real. The camera circles them as “Le jaaye jaane kahan, hawayein…” begins to play, the wedding lights blurring into soft halos around them.",

    "content": "I'm a huge fan of Hindi cinema—Bollywood has given us timeless magic, even if the craft feels diluted these days with formulaic tropes and fleeting trends. Yet, my love for it remains unwavering, rooted in those epic sagas, soul-stirring melodies, and visual poetry that once defined the industry.\n\nWhat I crave most is a revival in marketing that's authentic and immersive, not just a glossy PR spectacle. Today, promotions revolve around star-studded events, memes, and viral hooks, but rarely delve into the film's essence—the script's depth, a song's melody, the cinematography's framing, or the editing's rhythm. Remember the golden era when channels like SET Max released exclusive behind-the-scenes snippets, extended song cuts, or making-of featurettes? Those raw glimpses built anticipation and loyalty. Bring that back—let the art speak for itself.\n\nStorytelling in promotions is vanishing, and that's a missed opportunity. Imagine filmmakers sharing the genesis of a script: How did the idea spark during a late-night coffee or a real-life encounter? What research fueled it, and what hurdles—like budget constraints or location woes—did they conquer? Dedicate video series to this craft breakdown. Picture music directors like A.R. Rahman (whose recent revelation about \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja\" moved me deeply) recounting the director's brief, the lyricist's poetic sparks, collaborative jam sessions, and auditions where voices were tested until the perfect one emerged. Choreographers could unveil their vision boards—how a dance sequence evolved from mood boards to rehearsals, blending tradition with innovation. Directors might dissect shot compositions: Why that golden-hour lighting for an emotional climax, or how VFX bridged impossible worlds?\n\nBollywood stars jet to exotic locales for promotions, yet these trips often feel superficial—photo-ops and fan meets without substance. Why not transform them into storytelling hubs? Host intimate sessions where crews narrate these journeys on-site, perhaps at a film's shooting spot, inviting fans to connect with the process. People crave this insider magic; it humanizes the glamour and ignites curiosity. A.R. Rahman's tale of divine inspiration for \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja\"—born not for *Jodhaa Akbar* but from a spiritual pilgrimage—touched my heart precisely because it revealed the soul behind the sound.\n\nTrust me, this shift wouldn't just boost box office numbers by fostering genuine buzz; it'd spotlight unsung heroes—composers, lyricists, cinematographers, and more—elevating them to stardom. Audiences would invest emotionally, rediscovering Bollywood's collaborative heartbeat, and the industry would thrive on creativity, not just commerce. Let's reclaim that narrative charm; it's time Bollywood told its own epic backstory. What do you think—ready for this renaissance?\n",

Especially in recent times when I watch the fight scenes from Jawan and Sikandar, the effects and fight choreography just look horrible. \n\nI have seen some Bollywood movies with epic fight scenes such as Zanjeer (1973), Deewaar (1975), Muqaddar Ka Sikandar (1978), Khiladi (1992), Main Khiladi Tu Anari (1994), Khiladiyon Ka Khiladi (1996), Commando (2013), Commando 2 (2017), Sanak (2021), Baaghi (2016), War (2019), and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017). These films have had good fight scenes similar to Hong Kong Cinema. But another thing is, almost all of these films save for the Bachchan ones, Tiger Zinda Hai, and War have horrible storylines and pacing.\n\nCan anyone recommend movies with great fight scenes as well as okay/good storylines???",

The energy between Aamir and Salman, the absurd one-liners, and Shakti Kapoor’s “Crime Master Gogo” are pure gold.\n\nIt’s that rare movie where every actor seems to be in a different film, yet it somehow works perfectly. The chaos feels organic- not forced like most comedies today.\n\nDo you think Bollywood could ever pull off a film like this again, or was it just lightning in a bottle?",

The way it gently unfolds themes of love, family, and, ultimately, self-acceptance is extraordinary. But here lies the quiet irony:\n\nIn the final wedding scene, when Shashi delivers her heartfelt speech, she reminds us that our people - (partner, family and friends) will never judge us, will never laugh at our flaws, and will love us unconditionally. And I couldn’t agree more. Yet, beneath that beautiful message, there’s a deeper truth too; one that hits harder. We live in a world where even love often demands proof. Sometimes, you have to rise, to show your worth - even to those who should’ve seen it all along. When Shashi spoke in English, it wasn’t just a speech; it was her moment of reclaiming dignity — and that’s when her husband and daughter finally saw her, truly saw her.\n\nIn the end, the film leaves us with one resounding message - never shrink yourself for anyone. Believe, rise, and do everything it takes to become the version of yourself you’ve always deserved to be.",

In stree1, she was mentioned during night and in Stree2, we only saw her during Raat. It is possible Shama is a vampire and ally of\nRudra. May be Shama was responsible for bringing a part of Sarkata power which was sent to Pagal Akshay in the movie.\nThere is this line in the song chand ki qurbani lele dilbar jaani main, tu aag main paani\nAag - Werewolf hit blooded animal \nPaani - Vampire cold blooded \nChand ki Qurbani - Moon responsible for\nwerewolf powers. Vampire and werewolves are enimes.\n\n*Aao Kabhi Haveli Pe*: This promotional video song was not part of movie Stree but it featured Kriti Sanon. There was mention of both werewolf and vampire. The biggest plot reveal of Bhediya was Kriti being the werewolf\nRajkumar Rao as Vampire\n\n\n*Milegi Milegi*: The video may be a little glimpse of Stree backstory. But major plottwist could be Pankaj Tripathi character siting on the throne and everybody dancing on his command. It is possible he is the main mastermind of\nStree universe.\n\n\n*Thumkeshwari*: Since Kriti character died in the Bhediya According to song, now Varun Bhediya is going to get infatuated with Stree ki beti Shraddha. That's what happened in the climax of Stree 2.\n\n\n*Khoobsurat* : In this song there is Bhediya Varun, stree ki beti shraddha and Rakshak Rajkumar... it is possible Shraddha will be using both of them in her plans.\n\n*Kamariya and Dilbar ki Aankon*: Both nora songs. In one she was in Stree village and in one it looks like she is a city club. In stree , song ends with nora checking somebody watch and leaving. One of Rajkumar friend got kidnapped near sunrise time. It is possible, she is also a\nvampire in this universe.",

The story isn’t loud or over the top, it’s just two people who fall in love and then spend decades apart, holding on to that feeling quietly.\n\nWhat really hit me this time was the waiting. Twenty two years of love without communication, without hope, without closure. That kind of patience and emotional depth feels almost impossible in today’s world.\n\nThe music still gives chills. Madan Mohan’s melodies, brought to life again by his son, sound like memories you never lived but still miss. And Shah Rukh and Preity’s chemistry is all heart; no forced passion, just deep understanding.\n\nMaybe I’m getting older, but there’s something so haunting about loving someone and still choosing dignity over drama.\n\nAnyone else feel that Veer-Zaara wasn’t just a love story but a quiet tragedy disguised as hope?",

The message and everything. \n\nI had watched this 10 years ago but didn't understand the meaning as i was not an adult then but movies like this should be either re-released or movies like these with different story should be in the theater's. \n\nPlease make this movie trend again, this is a masterpiece which people should be aware of.\nWhy did such movies stopped after 2014. Or is this something which our parents feel old things are better for us to connect?\n\nI just love this movie 10/10.",

    "content": "“Rishtey kisi ek wajey se nahi toothti hai, bohot saari ladaiyon ki thakan hoti hai bas. Agar tu wakey mein bohot thak gayi hai aur tujhmein himmat nahi hai toh ek pal ke liye bhi mat sochna ki log lya kahengay par agar ek mauka de sakti hai toh dedena beta”\n\nThis scene from Jug Jugg Jeeyo hits different. It was a random watch when it was live on Amazon Prime but now I got this clip suggestion on Youtube and rewatched it. It’s such an underrated and beautiful scene. MIL opens upto DIL\nabout divorce and relationships, and it’s so much more real than typical Bollywood. MIL admits that she and her husband stopped being spouses years ago. They became parents and never found their way back after the kids left. Instead of the usual lecture about “making it work,” she actually validates her daughter-in-law’s feelings. This scene shows that staying married doesn’t always mean having a real relationship. Two people can share a home and still be emotionally miles apart. What I love most is how it challenges the idea that previous generations were better at relationships. They often stayed because leaving wasn’t an option, not because they were happier. This scene acknowledges that pain without romanticizing it.\n\nThis is the understanding we expect from our loved ones. Not guilt tripping. ",

Right from the Raj Kapoor-Devanand era they usually use debased currency in the form of coins or paper money. To point out, members may recall not so long ago in Amitabh’s movie Deewar, when young Amitabh’s character was shown working as a shoe-shine boy, two characters Iftekhar and Sudhir pay the boy throwing a coin in front of him. The coin shown was as if it was retrieved from a gutter or some ruins. This never occurs in Hollywood neither any British movies. They depict the authentic currency, of course without any disrespect. I am sure some of our members do share my views. ",

    "content": "When y'all say \"Bollywood should try something different\" or \"We want to see something new\", what do you usually mean?\n\nYou want new actors, new stories, or new genres all in all?\n\nI have been wondering about superhit movies from the past decade, that were not of the usual Bollywood genre trio (Romance, Comedy, Action). 'Unusual Hits'.\n\nOver the top of my head:\n1. 3 Idiots: relatable comedy\n2. Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety, or, Dil Chahta Hai (generation appealing friendship humour) though one is adult comedy, while the other has melodrama and a romantic side plot in it with slow humour and undubbed dialogue that doesnt hit the spot for youngsters\n3. Munjhya: romance between 2 outsider actors that stayed as friendship, plus the horror part\n4. Andhadhun: i havent seen this yet but i've heard the romance takes a dark turn in this, and a clip of the ending showed that even the female lead was a strong character\n5. Golmaal 3: no romance as far as I remember, just friendship, family and fun. \n6. Om Shanti Om: rebirth, satirical melodrama and a strong female lead: all in a modern era.\n7. Kal Ho Na Ho: romance but really tragic, so tragic that it gets overshadowed by Saif-SRK friendship and witty SRK-Preity banters. India's own Its A Wonderful Life in a way\n8. Student Of The Year: romance is to build up tension between the trio leads, but the rest of the movie is pretty much about winning the SOTY trophy, showing exams, treasure hunt and a triathon\n9. Ghajini: though a remake of a remake, the concept was pretty ahead of its time for that era, and it was executed so well that we even understood it. Asin has always been a strong female lead in Bollywood, often overshadowing her male leads. We seldom saw that in Kollywood; Pokiri, Ghajini, Dasavataram\n10. Koi Mil Gaya: sci fi remake of a hollywood movie stolen from an Indian director's own story. Preity had a memorable and solid role in this \n11. Dangal: even amidst a massive boycott, unlike LSC, this movie became a hit and a classic. A sports biopic lucky to be released when the genre was respected and appreciated (Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Chak De India, Mary Kom), it's unusual that so many people went for this feminist sports drama. We see Shabash Mithu, Saina, Jersey, 83 being unfortunate flops today.\n\nAny other such 'Unusual Hits' of Bollywood you can think of? Movies that were made for some other era but got hit in the one they released in? No romance, no action, no comedy!",

Ranbir added that Animal was “misconstrued.”\n\nThat got me thinking.\n\nBollywood has often made films that do act as moral mirrors i.e. Pink, Thappad, Newton, Pagglait, Astitva, Ankur, Do Bigha Zamin; all questioning what’s wrong with society and urging introspection.\n\nSo why is it that when a film glorifies regressive or harmful behavior, we suddenly separate art from morality? If cinema can critique society, shouldn’t it also be questioned when it celebrates the same flaws?\n\nJust something I’ve been thinking sporadically about especially considering how much Bollywood shapes perceptions of masculinity, power, and relationships.\n\nWould love to hear different takes or counter-arguments.\nWould love to hear counter-opinions and to be challenged, as long as it’s a genuine discussion.",

    "content": "**Edit: I made a mistake in the title - the film was released in 1998, not 2003. Sorry for the confusion!**\n\nI recently rewatched \"Kareeb\" and I'm genuinely surprised this film doesn't get discussed more often here. For those who haven't seen it, this is a compelling drama that tackles themes of ambition, relationships, and the price of success in a refreshingly honest way. The performances are solid across the board, and the storytelling feels more grounded compared to typical Bollywood fare from that era.\n\nWhat really stands out is how the film explores the protagonist's journey without resorting to over-the-top melodrama. The cinematography has this dreamy, almost ethereal quality that perfectly complements the narrative tone.\n\nI know it's not as mainstream as other 1998 releases, but sometimes the best films are the ones that flew under the radar. If you're looking for something different from your usual Bollywood watch list, definitely give this one a shot.\n\nHas anyone else here seen \"Kareeb\"? Would love to hear your thoughts on it. I feel like this deserves to be part of more \"underrated Bollywood films\" discussions.",

But what started with new premise fresh perspective on the three urban young characters in the first half quickly turns into a movie primarly focusing on the love story of Akash in the usual bollywood melodramatic trope. \n\nI was expecting it to be about three friends and how they and their friendship evolve which it was at the core of it. But I wasnt expecting a long detour with Akash and Shalini track. \n\nI am not comparing them but do you think like Taare Zameen Par and 3Idiots, DCH still stands tall on its own merit without the context of its time.

    "content": "Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy's 2024 assertion that Indian youth should embrace 70-hour workweeks to boost national productivity sparked widespread debate. Murthy defended his stance by citing his own 40-year experience of working long hours, emphasizing that such dedication was essential for success. He clarified that while he believed in the value of hard work, no one should be forced into such a regimen, underscoring the importance of personal choice in career commitments. \n\nMeanwhile actress Deepika Padukone faced significant backlash and got replaced after requesting an 8-hour workday, a standard practice in many professions, to maintain a healthy work-life balance, especially after becoming a mother. Her demand led to her exit from two major film projects, with media and industry insiders labeling her as \"unprofessional.\" \n\nMeanwhile, the backbone of film production—the crew—faces extreme schedules with minimal pay. Light boys in reputed production houses earn around ₹1,500–₹2,000 for a 12-hour shift, or else they get 1k-1.5k only which often stretches to 14–16 hours, yet they sometimes aren’t paid for the extra work. Spot boys start as early as 4–5 a.m. to prepare sets and vanity for artists arriving at 6–7 a.m., and they are usually the last to leave, staying long after everyone else. Their labor keeps the film running, yet it’s undervalued and overlooked.\n\nThis isn’t just about pay—it’s about respect, fairness, and acknowledgment. While male superstars earn crores, women advocating reasonable hours and crew working grueling shifts struggle for basic dignity. Bollywood glorifies sacrifice when convenient but punishes those who demand balance.\n\nSpotboys has to reach 4-5 am to keep setup and vanity ready for artist who are going to reach  6-7am. On set and they are the last person on set who leaves at last after all crew members left.\n\nThis is not just limited to few crew members there are other departments whose Assistant has to reach 1 hour early than what shift time is.... \n\n\n And yet, imagine the harsh reality if these tireless workers ever demanded the respect and dignity that should be their right",

Every frame is drenched in emotion — the lighting, the music, the way Hrithik Roshan’s eyes carry both pain and peace at the same time. It’s one of those films that doesn’t beg for your sympathy but earns your respect through its honesty. The chemistry between Ethan and Sofia isn’t loud or dramatic; it’s tender, mature, and deeply human. Bhansali’s direction makes even silence feel beautiful — the stillness, the dust in the light, the sound of the rain — everything tells a story. ",

    "title": "Downfall of Dharma",
    "content": "**TLDR: VERY LONG post but I am just telling KJO to work on the story and then make a film. The story decides everything. Do not make a movie based on the actors and formulate the story about it. First find a good story with actual writers, and then find actors that fit that role**  \n  \n  \nHey everyone, last week I made a post about how the untalented actresses are getting several opportunities which are ruining some decent films. So I decided to rewatch some Bollywood movies that I used to watch as I grew up and I just don't understand what happened to Dharma. Like they just lost all there charm in their movies. And I noticed that there were 3 categories they used to make their films in and how now barely any of them fit. So here goes, this might be kind of long but if you get a chance to read this I would appreciate it. (note: This is about the films they produced not distributed/presented)\n\n1) Classics- So these are obviously the big ones right like KKHH, K3G, KHNH, KANK, etc. (So many K's LOL) But these are the ones that are universally loved. Are they melodramatic, over the top, and stereotypical? Sure but despite those flaws these films are critically acclaimed and have a cult status because they actually had actors who gave their 100%, a director who cared, and a proper story. Like even a movie with a lot of flaws like Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna, it had unnecessary subplots with making Big B a playboy and whatever and then 2 seconds later you have Abhishek acting his butt off and SRK being extremely convincing as a jerk, a cool twist on his typical lover boy. \n\n2) Modern- So this is like towards 2007, when Bollywood hit a new experimental area. Movies like Luck By Chance, Taare Zameen Par would come out at the same time as Om Shanti Om and Welcome. So of course Dharma joined in as well, and actually made some decent movies. Wake Up Sid, YJHD, Dulhania series, 2 States, Dostana, etc. And these movies were also pretty good let's be honest. Yeah the new batch had some over the top and some acting they needed to work on but the music album would be a blast or the story would be interesting or the acting performances would just be off the charts. Like I mean in one year they released Wake Up Sid/Ek Main Aur Ek Tu and Dostana, both modern takes on newer generation problems (coming of age story and finding your own place/typical love triangle). But still they were churning out these fun stories. \n\n3) Risks- Now I know a lot of people say Dharma is just romantic movies SRK-Kajol pair but tbh they did take a lot of risks. I mean releasing My Name is Khan was just an extremely risky move as we all know and even making a movie like Kurbaan. They would release a We Are Family, a sad family drama, and then a rom com with 2 new actors like I Hate Luv Stories. Or then they would remake a big flop and made it a blockbuster like Agneepath and in the same year release SOTY. I mean look at 2016. We had Kapoor and Sons, a somber family drama which was excellent with amazing performances and an actual proper take on difficulties in family life, sexualities, and love. Then a pretty forgetful Baar Baar Dekho but at least it had a decent music album. Then we would have the terrible ADHM (hot take, I just hate this movie don't get me started, music is great tho) but people loved it. And then an actual slice of life coming of age movie like Dear Zindagi. So there was a lot of variety\n\n\n\nSo what changed? Was it the constant remakes, the launching of more and more untalented actors, or have they lost their touch? Honestly, I do not think Karan has lost his touch. I mean look at 2017 beyond right, in my opinion the only good films that were produced were: Badri Ki Dulhania, Ittefaq, Raazi, Simmba, Kesari, Good Newwz, Shershaah, Sooryavanshi, Gehraiyaan, JugJug Jeeyo, Bhramastra, Rocky Rani, and Kill. They have produced 32 films since 2017 and this is only 13. And even some of these are whatever.\n\nThe problem is all those movies look the same. The production design for Good Newwz, JugJug Jeeyo, Rocky Rani, and now Sunny Sanskari look they are all the same. Bhramastra was an interesting risk, pretty bad script we all know, but it was still something fresh and new like Kill and honestly Rocky Rani. \n\nIt feels like these days it's a check mark. Like is there a song with a hook step that will go viral on insta reels (What Jhumka, Naach Punjabaan, Toba Toba, Panwaadi, every song from Govinda Naam Mera and Selfiee) or is it a popular story that we can remake or lets bring a famous South actor and just stuff them in the film, not make an actual film that showcases their skills (Devara, Dhadak 1, Selfiee, Dhadak 2, Liger). Or it is just a film made to launch the new nepokid OR a film with a nepokid in a different role to show they have \"variety in their acting\", and no just because you made Kill does not mean anything (Ae Watan Mere Watan, Naadaniyan, Student of the Year 2, Dhadak, Gajat Saxena, Liger, Mr. and Mrs. Mahi, Sarzameen)  \n\n\nThe only one where I feel like a flop movie that Dharma tried on and it unfortunately did not work were Brothers and Kalank. I thought Brothers, even though it was a remake, it actually was good and had amazing performances. Or the thing with Kalank was like production design was great, performances, dances were good but they just needed to work on the story.\n\n**AND THIS IS MY MAIN POINT!** Dharma used to care about the story of the film and that is what makes the movie. But now it is like, \"Oh let's get this popular actor, add a reel, put the same set from a different movie, sell OTT rights for the budget and release it, if it goes well good PR for the actors and if it is bad we will have director go do an apology\". Like no this won't cut it anymore. And this is the same as Maddock (whole other story but basic gist is that it feels like the horror comedy is like let's add some insta jokes, dance item song, and tease at the end). \n\nBut please KJO if you are listening, just stop wasting your time with giving these actors and actresses who have had 10-15 movies and have not improved any more chances. Please come back to the director chair and make an actual film not a reactionary one. Yes Rocky Rani was good, but it sounded like a response to every little critique and felt more as a PSA than an actual film. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was ruined with a terrible cancer subplot and a somewhat cringe first half, you had an actual film that you could have made with the one-sided love but it was just ruined. Please make something you are passionate about and a story you truly want to tell. Don't make it like a check box. ",

    "content": "I recently rewatched *Dil Se* and was struck again by how intense and passionate the story feels, especially Shah Rukh Khan’s portrayal of obsession and longing. The film’s music, from “Chaiyya Chaiyya” to “Jiya Jale,” really amplifies the emotional weight.\n\nA few questions for discussion:\n\n* Which scene or moment do you think best captures the intensity of the romance?\n* How do you interpret the film’s ending and the fate of the characters?\n* Do you think the political undertones add depth to the love story, or do they distract from it?\n* Which song from *Dil Se* do you feel still resonates the most today?\n\nWould love to hear your perspectives! it’s a film that feels very different every time you watch it.",

It’s a slow, poetic self-destruction. Every frame bleeds excess; Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s sets, Ismail Darbar’s music, Madhuri’s grace, Aishwarya’s heartbreak and right in the middle, SRK drowning in his own ego and pain.\n\nEven if you find the melodrama overwhelming, the emotional realism is terrifying.

    "content": "I just saw an old post on this sub about someone asking why people are fans of Vanga, and wanted to share my thoughts.\n\nPersonally, I think after a long time, Bollywood has a director that directs with intent. Each of his scenes is important, builds character or moves the story forward in some way. His cinematography is purposeful, which I really appreciate (for example, the scene in Animal where Ranvijay brought Geetanjali to meet his dad for the first time, and they were waiting for him in front of this massive bookcase; excellent shot). \n\nI’m not really one to be influenced by movies where my mindset completely changes, but I understand there are a lot of people that see it is “Toxic masculinity is awesome” which is terrible (and kind of ridiculous it’s a movie). His characters are clearly not someone who’s supposed to be a role model by any means; but dramatic and grey characters make compelling stories.  \n\nI really think we need more directors like him in the industry, not necessarily always the type of movies he makes but the dedication and vision he works with. The intent he works with, and the performances he brings out of actors. He makes massy movies, but they’re made as real films not just corporate churn outs.  \n\nAnd oh man his background music 😮‍💨. How often do you see that, he personally puts thought into what the background music and what the songs should be. Aamir Khan said it best in an interview, that filmmaking is a combination of many different arts, and Vanga puts thought and effort into each art that goes into his films. \n\n\nHe definitely takes a lot of inspiration from Scorsese, which I really appreciate, big Scorsese fan myself. I enjoyed Kabir Singh, Arjun Reddy, and Animal, I’m excited to see what he does with Spirit.\n",

    "content": "It’s been ages since I last watched Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, so apologies if I’m rusty on a few details. But a recent group discussion made me think again about some of its character dynamics.\n\nThe debate started when someone called Avi a red flag. Personally, I don’t think he was. As far as I remember, Avi was never in love with Aditi. It was a one sided thing from her side. She never confessed to him. Avi’s frustration toward Bunny was the he was just hurt that his best friend was leaving without telling them. Their bond was pure bromance. Avi teasing Aditi during her wedding felt more like the typical “old friends being playful” vibe. His gambling and drinking issues were problematic, but that’s a separate topic altogether.\n\nThen there’s Aditi, crying over a guy who never even knew she liked him. Did she ever really try to communicate that? Or was she holding onto an idea of him that never existed?\n\nMoving on to Naina — honestly, who in their right mind holds onto a crush for years and cries about it? The level of lingering feels unhealthy more than romantic.\n\nAnd finally, Bunny’s sudden love story arc. His entire worldview was about exploring the world and chasing his dreams. Then out of nowhere, he decides to give it all up for Naina, someone he barely kept in touch with and reconnected with only during Aditi’s wedding. I get that he might have realized the importance of relationships after not being there when his dad passed and the lost time with his best friends, but the romantic leap just felt forced.\n\nTo me, YJHD shines as a friendship and self-discovery film, but the love story part feels like an afterthought added for Bollywood convention.",

    "title": "Rajat Bedi Wasn’t “Sidelined” — He Misread His Own Career",
    "content": "Rajat Bedi’s recent attempts to rewrite his Bollywood journey (from saying his *Koi Mil Gaya* scenes were cut to later claiming he was “misquoted” by Mukesh Khanna) have reignited a strange nostalgia online.\n\nBut if you actually trace his filmography, the truth is far simpler — he wasn’t sabotaged, he just misread what kind of actor he was and what kind of films he was in.\n\n# 1. Do Hazaar Ek (1998): The Debut That Exposed the Cracks\n\nHis first major appearance — alongside Jackie Shroff and Tabu — showed a rookie trying to act like a star.  \nThe problem? No screen presence, stiff dancing, and zero charisma next to veterans.  \nIn the late ’90s, that was a death sentence for any “new hero.” Remember the song \"Tu Kaatil Tera Dil Kaatil\".\n\nHe entered an industry that demanded **swagger and confidence**; he came off earnest but awkward.\n\n# 2. International Khiladi (1999): A Golden Chance, Wasted\n\nPlaying the main antagonist opposite Akshay Kumar should’ve been his breakout.  \nBut he got overshadowed — Akshay was sharper, agile and more magnetic.  \nRajat’s dialogue delivery felt stagey, his menace unconvincing. So instead of hating him, the audience just ignored him. And in Bollywood, **indifference kills careers faster than bad press.**\n\n# 3. Koi… Mil Gaya (2003): Misunderstanding the Premise\n\nHe later said his scenes were “cut” and that he was sidelined from promotions.  \nBut think about it — this film revolved around a mentally challenged man, his alien friend, and the emotional transformation they trigger.  \nHow much space could a college bully *realistically* get in that kind of story?\n\n**It wasn’t personal. It was structural.**  \nEven if he had 10 more minutes, the audience’s empathy was always going to stay with Rohit (Hrithik), not Raj (Rajat).\n\nIronically, Hrithik’s performance in *KMG* shows exactly what Rajat never learned —  \nthat versatility and vulnerability build longevity, not bravado.\n\n# 4. The Real Problem: No Defined Lane\n\nBy the 2000s, every contemporary had carved an identity:  \nAkshay — disciplined action star.  \nSaif — charming romantic.  \nJohn — intense urban hero.  \nArshad — grounded comic.  \nRajat? A tall man with decent looks but no clear image.\n\n**Too good-looking for “character villain,” too flat for “romantic hero.**”  \nHe fell through the cracks.\n\n# 5. The Irony of His Comeback\n\nNow, after *The Ba*\\*\\*ds of Bollywood\\*, he’s trending for being interesting — not heroic.  \nBut instead of owning that niche (the flawed, layered antagonist), he’s revising history to sound like an unsung hero who was “edited out” of greatness.\n\nThe truth: he wasn’t edited out; **he was never written in strongly enough.**\n\nRajat Bedi wasn’t “destroyed by Bollywood.”  \nHe just refused to evolve, misread his place in the system, and confused visibility with value.\n\nBollywood didn’t betray Rajat Bedi; it just moved on while he kept waiting for an applause that was never coming.",

It’s the kind of film that forces you to sit still and *feel*, instead of analyze.\n\nBanita Sandhu barely moves for most of the runtime, yet her stillness is the center of the movie. Varun Dhawan plays Dan, not as a “lover,” but as a boy stumbling into empathy and that’s the entire miracle. It’s not love built on attraction or possession, but on attention. The kind of attention that changes you, without promising anything in return.\n\n*October* isn’t meant to entertain; it’s meant to linger. You don’t watch it to find out what happens.

    "content": "Just watched Suraj Ka Satvaan Ghoda (1992).\nI had read the novella by Dharamvir Bharati. I think the novella has covered more stories than the movie but the movie itself is a masterpiece. The indian youth society in early 90s, the mindset of the grownups and the societal pressure faced by the women, caste culture and the struggle to make a living are portyed through series of events and characters. Characters themselves and the setting is pretty relevent.\nWhat I love the most is how the ending is done. Manik Mulla has performed with upmost authenticity.\nLoved it and I  recommend to read the novella and watch the movie.",

It beautifully captures the emotional toll of rebellion and sacrifice through Sara Ali Khan’s restrained yet heartfelt performance.\n\nThe pacing drags a little in the second half, but the film’s sincerity and period detailing make up for it. The music complements the tone perfectly! Especially that haunting closing track.\n\nDid anyone else feel echoes of *Rang De Basanti* or even *Shaheed* here in terms of emotional impact?",

Shah Rukh brings charm, Deepika shines, and the film blends nostalgia with a touch of tragedy. Behind the glitz, there's a quiet story about love, loss, and second chances - still enjoyable, still emotional, just hits a little differently now. ",

    "title": "Watched Dhadak-2 and Saiyaara and can understand why one was a BO blockbuster while other one flopped badly",
    "content": "The primary target audience for most romantic movies is the 13-25 age group because when reality kicks in , the movie which make you go eww will make you feel cringe.Shah Rukh Khan's entire stardom was built on consistently catering to the emotions of this demographic in the 90s.\n\nTo check on the hype ,  I recently watched both of the aforementioned movies. Personally, I found both films underwhelming. However, if we are to compare chemistry and connection between the leads, \"Saiyaara\" was slightly better. The entire plot of \"Dhadak-2\" felt forced, as if the director was solely focused on presenting an anti-caste narrative based on reading some news articles and events  without first establishing a solid foundational story . \"Masaan\" starring Vicky kaushal and Shweta with just  few scenes had more connection than entire Dhadak-2 movie.\n\nBased on my understanding, the reason behind \"Saiyaara's\" success was its effective catering to raw emotions and commercial appeal. Its target audience was largely urban Gen-Z females, who could project themselves into a narrative of maladaptive daydreaming—experiencing a heartbreak and later entering a relationship with a man far better than her ex. The film also featured open-minded parents like the female lead's and, despite all obstacles, concluded with a happy ending.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Dhadak-2\" was a romance built around a heavy, issue-based subject. I don't know how it got critical acclaim as the entire movie lack any substance ,just because it is touching on social issues doesn't mean the movie is better. I can understand that Siddhant chaturvedi was playing a downtrodden dalit guy ,but in any realistic setting , to woo a girl like Tripti dimri in 2-3 meetings , he has to be presentable and exude some charm . Tbh in entire movie only Saurabh sachdev scenes generate some interest. While casteism is indeed prevalent even in urban areas, the screenplay felt as if it was  constructed merely by scanning news headlines and twitter threads rather than drawing from nuanced, real-life case studies.\n\nFor any romantic drama to strike a chord, there must be a genuine connection with its target audience. Be it \"Kabir Singh,\" which catered to a male fantasy, or \"Saiyaara,\" which succeeded with a female audience. Once one gender starts flocking theatre halls, the other gender quietly joins in for the FOMO and to be a part of group. Music is just a bonus element and in no way can solely guarantee box office numbers.\n\nWhile narratives centered on anti-caste love stories may find an audience in regional cinema, frankly, there is a limited market for them in mainstream Hindi cinema. Whoever initially suggested that Dharma Productions frame \"Dhadak-1\" as a class narrative instead of a caste one was correct. Studios like Dharma and YRF should avoid this pitfall and leave such subjects to filmmakers like Pa Ranjith , Anurag Kashyap and others who specialize in handling them.\n\nAnd I don't understand how this lad Siddhant chaturvedi is still getting movies, he has a irritating screen presence ,looks and act too average .",
