    "content": "Hi everyone,  \n  \nI wanted to share the main theme from a project I’ve been working on, *It Was That Summer*. It’s a story-driven visual novel about love, friendship, and the quiet moments that change who you become.\n\nThe track plays in one of the opening scenes, set in a quiet Cambridge classroom on a warm July afternoon. I wanted to capture that mid-2000s nostalgia, the feeling of being young, uncertain, and completely alive.\n\nWould love to hear what you think about the atmosphere or mood. I’m always curious how people interpret game themes out of context.",

It’s completely free  \n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3702550/SOS\\_Incident/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3702550/SOS_Incident/)  \n— I’d be thrilled if you gave it a shot. Feedback is welcome, but mostly I just hope it makes you scream at least once. Play the demo on Steam Thanks for reading, and let me know if it gets under your skin.",

    "content": "Hey there! So I've been going through my list of untitled videogame songs that I've gathered through the years, and although I managed to identify the vast majority of them, two of them are proving to be quite elusive, resisting identification despite me using every song identification program I can think of (Shazam, AHA, Librezam, Music Identifier and AudioTag). And the info I found in their metadata isn't helping me get anywhere either: the first one is titled \"Crystal Castle\" and the second one is titled \"{xog\".\n\nBoth of them sound VERY Japanese, so I wouldn't be surprised if they come from some JRPGs or action games. Honestly, both of them sound so good, I'm surprised the identification programs can't find them, as I'd expect such good songs to be famous and easily identifiable. Anyway, I've uploaded the original files in OGG format to my Google Drive, the links are below:\n\n[~~https://drive.google.com/file/d/158eVsAX\\_a3mv-Imgx1OON2BrR1xlShMz/view?usp=drive\\_link~~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/158eVsAX_a3mv-Imgx1OON2BrR1xlShMz/view?usp=drive_link) (found!)\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DkqUmkh9Pg-\\_Jyy-PLJyjqj6MWKlByx/view?usp=drive\\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DkqUmkh9Pg-_Jyy-PLJyjqj6MWKlByx/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nIf anyone could give me a hand, I would be eternally grateful!\n\nEdit #1: Many thanks to u/[GroundbreakingCup391](https://www.reddit.com/user/GroundbreakingCup391/) for discovering the first one!",

    "title": "🎮 [OC] I wrote a full video game soundtrack for a game that doesn’t exist — it became my way of healing",
    "content": "[Edited]\n\nHey everyone,\nI wanted to share something really personal that I’ve been working on over the past few months.\n\nBack in June, I went through a really rough period — I was assaulted, had to move out suddenly, and my long relationship ended around the same time. I felt lost for a while, and music became the only thing that helped me feel grounded again.\n\nDuring that time, I was playing a lot of Borderlands 4, and I got this idea:\n“What if I wrote the soundtrack to a video game that doesn’t exist?”\n\nThat became the concept for my new project — Chrono//Circuit, a cinematic, progressive, synth-heavy instrumental album written as if it were a complete video game soundtrack.\nI designed the album like a story-driven campaign:\n\nYou start the game and descend into the abyss, journey through chaos and self-discovery, save your progress halfway, and finally face the last boss — and win.\nEvery track represents a different stage of that journey.\n\n🎧 Track 6 — Ambient//Save Point is the calm before the storm.\n🎧 Track 8 — Override//Godmode is the final, epic boss battle theme.\n\nIt’s heavily inspired by games and composers that balance emotion and power — mixed with the aesthetics of The Midnight, Joywave, and Bring Me The Horizon, alongside progressive metal influences like David Maxim Micic, Toska, and Vower.\n\n💿 Chrono//Circuit [2025]\nStart Game//Enter Abyss\nInitialize: Pulse\nDysphoria\nCovenant\nAnima.exe\nAmbient//Save Point\nEcho Protocol: Requiem\nOverride//Godmode\n\n🎧 Listen / Watch here:\n▶️ YouTube full album: https://youtu.be/cvGJxj3Ewd4?si=Qt85zUn_TrTP-4y8\n🌐 All streaming platforms: https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/verniorion/chronocircuit/\n\nAll instruments, production, mixing, mastering, video, and artwork by me — Nico Faarpyöli.\n\n🖼️ About the artwork &amp; video:\nThe artwork isn’t AI-generated from scratch — I built it using my own photographs as the foundation. I used a photo of myself to create the person in the image, and a picture from my own window view to generate the background using AI assistance. Then I manually cut and layered everything in my photo editing software, added text as separate layers, and arranged the composition myself.\nFor the video, I extended the background using AI tools, exported each element (person, background, text) as separate layers, and then combined everything in my mobile video editor. I created the text (artist and song title) in my photo editor, exported each text layer, and animated them individually — adding a glitch effect only to the song title layer. I also added smoke effects around the person. Every part of this process was carefully crafted by me using my own photography, design, and editing skills.\n\n📝 Why I use AI to write posts:\nEnglish is my second language, and I’m still learning how to write grammatically correct, clear posts. I give AI all the points about me, my music, how I’m feeling, how I create my songs, and where people can find my music — basically, my own “review” of the album. Then AI helps me compress my thoughts and feelings into a version that’s more understandable and consumable, while still keeping my voice and story authentic.\n\nI tried to make this feel like a real game OST — something you could imagine playing during boss fights, cinematic cutscenes, or that quiet save room before the final encounter.\n\n💾 If Chrono//Circuit were an actual game, what genre do you think it would be?\n\n🌐 Follow for more:\n@verniorion",

    "content": "When I heard the soundtracks to games that I first played in 1998, like FF8, Silent Hill, and Final Fantasy Tactics, I wished I could make music like that for video games. After much self-study and decades of playing and creating music in many different contexts, with and without friends, on a laptop, on a stage, or in a recording studio, learning many different instruments along the way, I started a passion project for a game idea I had since I was young: *NEGOTIATIONS HAVE FAILED!* It's a hardcore minimalist, turn-based card battler inspired by JRPGs\n\nI was tempted to start making songs for the game as I was learning how to program it, but I knew that if I made the music first, I would have stopped the project entirely, being satisfied with getting musical ideas out of my system. But I designed the game's single player/multiplayer experience, and only once that and the artwork was done did I start writing songs for it. I used FamiStudio, which emulates the Nintendo sound chip and carries limitations, like having only three mono-tonal sounds at once, which presented a very challenging but rewarding compositional challenge.\n\nYou can play the demo and wishlist *NEGOTIATIONS HAVE FAILED* on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3401430/Negotiations\\_Have\\_Failed/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3401430/Negotiations_Have_Failed/)\n\nThe demo's soundtrack is available in the link above and here, with a neat visualization of the song's arrangement in Famistudio: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD\\_uSb5cHQA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD_uSb5cHQA)",

    "content": "Hi!\nI’m a university student in South Korea majoring in classical piano, and I was born in 2003.\n\nWhen I was a child, I played Pokémon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum and later Black/White, and those games still mean a lot to me.\nRecently, I’ve been listening to their soundtracks again on YouTube — especially the Pokémon Black and White (Gen 5) BGM — and I realized how deeply the music brings back memories of that world.\nIt somehow makes me feel like the Unova region still exists somewhere.\n\nBecause I’m studying music, I’ve become really curious about how those tracks were actually made.\nI’ve read that the main composers were Junichi Masuda and Go Ichinose, but in Korean sources there’s almost no information about what tools, MIDI engines, or sound systems were used to create the music.\nMost Korean discussions focus on gameplay or lore, not the music production itself.\n\nSo I’d like to ask:\n\n1️⃣ How were the Gen 4–5 Pokémon soundtracks actually composed and produced on the DS hardware?\n2️⃣ What kind of tools, software, or internal MIDI/sound systems (like SSEQ, SWAR, etc.) were used by Game Freak’s sound team?\n3️⃣ Are there any English or Japanese blogs, research articles, or communities where I can study this more deeply?\n\nI’m Korean and new to MIDI or digital composition (my background is entirely classical),\nbut I’d love to understand the technical and artistic process behind those amazing soundtracks.\n\nAny help, links, or keywords would be really appreciated.\nThank you so much!",

    "content": "I’ll start:\n\n1. Umineko\nNothing comes close. It has hundreds of tracks, and a significant degree of variation. Truly one of the best uses of the leitmotif in soundtracks ever. If you like soft, piano pieces, it has them. EDM? It has them. Full on orchestral tracks? It has them. Really unique sounding music? It has them. You continue to hear new, high quality tracks till the literal last scene.\n\n2. Expedition 33\nNeeds no real explanation. Personally, I found the best tracks were “front loaded”, and I wish it had more. After the halfway point of the game, and when youve heard the first variation of the final boss theme, youve kinda heard it all. Absolutely loved the creativity with this one though.\nPS: if you loved this OST youd love French music in general. Lorien is clearly very talented but just like the Japanese have their own way of composing, so too do the French and I think youll find ALOT of cool songs in the “genre”.\n\n3. Persona 3 FES\nIts hard to believe that almost 20 years ago someone decided to make an entire anime OST using a japanese guy rapping english lyrics, mixed with a female japanese vocalist singing english, but they did. This was by far and away the soundtrack that made me realize gaming is in a league of its own when it comes to creativity.",

Flower has some good tracks but they don’t seem to be as…iconic? I checked out Gris but I’m not too much of a fan of the electronic flair and the tracks are  rather short \n\nI don’t really like the Elder Scrolls or Witcher sound track. Even though they’re orchestral, they seem a bit *too* background music-like, almost like it has kind of a “hollow” atmosphere, if that makes sense. Good for in game, but I bounce off of it when not playing \n\nIt may also be just a case of ever-elusive unicorn track that can’t be replicated because of the sentimental value the game itself has to me\n\nBut I’ve been on the hunt for something similar to Journeys OST!!",

Nintendo really likes doing this, I guess.\n\nThree Houses is the exception though because goddamn\n\n  \nAgain, I don’t think leitmotifs are always bad",

    "content": "Hi everyone! I wanted to share the work of my composer, James Smith.\n\nFor [The Home County](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3672100/The_Home_County/)'s soundtrack, we wanted to do 'Vivaldi's Four Seasons but for British eras.'\n\n**Roman Era**\n\n*Mines of the Legionnaire* and *Spirits from Empires Below*\n\nWe were incredible fortunate to have the Grammy nominated woodwind specialist Sandro Friedrich to record a number of layered flutes including the pivana, occorso, zurna and the bouzouki. The light and lilting nature of these interwoven lines immediately immerses you in an ancient era. Underpinning the flute layers we have lyres and the Roman war drums but the instrument that stands out to us is the Cornu, an ancient Roman military brass instrument.\n\n**Saxon Era**\n\n*March of The Pickaxe, Saxon Ancestors and Under the Barrow Downs*\n\nThe Saxons were a challenge to blend into the game’s existing sound world, so we leaned into folk music and ritualistic elements using wooden flutes, penny whistle, and medieval fiddle. After experimenting widely, we discovered the hurdy-gurdy and collaborated with Vicki Swan, whose mastery of the nyckelharpa brought new texture and drive. This led to an ensemble of fiddle, nyckelharpa, and octav-harpa layered with orchestra, creating the warm, resonant sound heard in *March of the Pickaxe.*\n\n***Viking Era***\n\n*Hammerfall in The Deep*\n\nThe Viking Mines section aimed to capture a Viking sound without relying on clichés, using unique instruments like the carynx, ram’s horns, and nyckelharpa to create an earthy, resonant tone. Recordings in a stone church enhanced the cavernous feel, while rhythmic Viking drums tied it all together.\n\n**Victorian/Edwardian Era**\n\n*Song Beneath the Sun, When Seasons Turn or Spring Dance*\n\nThis era draws inspiration from Downton Abbey and The Shire, using gentle orchestral themes that unify the game’s weather, characters, and areas. Influenced by Victorian/Edwardian composers like Elgar, Holst, and Vaughan Williams, it blends pastoral warmth with graceful 3/4 rhythms for a cosy, nostalgic feel.\n\n**TL;DR: Like Vivaldi's Four Seasons but for the Eras of Britain.**\n\nYou can listen on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/the-home-county-original-game-soundtrack/1844443367) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6k7ACYxlRT9gCDu1LbNUdI) or [YouTube Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGjQAgZeyCE&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nJzg5eslRVSMci--LwmKdydCcagFUvWyQ&amp;index=2).\n\nThe composer is [James Smith](http://facebook.com/jamessmithcomposer), who I would wholeheartedly recommend.",

    "content": "You can't store the metadata internally in these files. I have to store tags in an external file.  \nEDIT: I posted likely the best solution in replies. Short solution but several key points.\n\nI am aware that with vgmstream, you can make a text file. The only issue is that every change has to be typed in this file, a bit tedious. I use the foobar2000 media player, and I can't take advantage of any bulk tagging operations, or any user interface that interacts with metadata (such as setting a rating for a song by clicking on an icon).\n\nfb2k does have components such as externalTags and m-Tag, but they are not ideal.  \nI'm currently trying extTags because you can do anything that storing metadata internally in files can do. Only issue is the text file it saves looks sketchy.  \nI'm not really a fan of the way m-Tags works, because the file is also like a playlist file, so it double-counts the tracks, and I can fix it but I don't like it. I'll spare the details.\n\nPerhaps there's a solution for these methods that I'm missing. Or if you did something else let me know. Regardless, any thoughts are appreciated.",

Kai) from Sega. \nI've been listening to some of his songs and it seems to me, there's high probability that Takahiro Kai is Cafe Au Lait.

I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/@VideoGameBackingTracks) YouTube channel which has some good stuff, but looking for more if anyone has any other sources. I'm also curious on how this person does it if anyone has any ideas? What kind of file and program would you need to be able to remove the melody track? I'm no music producer, but my gut tells me just having an MP3 or something and Audacity wouldn't work since the audio wouldn't be broken up into channels. Or is there some way to do it without a file broken up into tracks? What would be the process here? I guess this question also kind of applies to making a backing track in general for any song really.",

    "content": "Hello everyone, I want to share a story about how video game music inspired me to create my own.\n\nSo, when I was just 11 years old, I played Undertale and absolutely loved its soundtrack. I was curious about how music like that was even made, but at that age, I didn't look too deeply into it and eventually forgot about it.\n\nThen, four years later, I stumbled upon the Undertale soundtrack again in my recommendations. After listening to some of the tracks, I decided to dive into the process of making music, starting with Toby Fox's approach. I downloaded FL Studio and started experimenting.\n\nNow, three years later, I've released some of my tracks in an album on streaming platforms. This is my personal favorite:\n\nSpotify: [https://open.spotify.com/track/7su4JiVEULiTJUDjGMiHxF?si=80d86e1c0ba64d2e](https://open.spotify.com/track/7su4JiVEULiTJUDjGMiHxF?si=80d86e1c0ba64d2e)\n\nI'm not expecting any hype around them—I'm completely self-taught and do everything by ear, I just genuinely enjoy doing it. Maybe someone will like my tracks. In any case, this is better than letting them gather dust on my hard drive.\n\nAnyway, I have to thank Toby Fox for inspiring me to take that first step in composing music.",

If others want to listen and give feedback, that's cool too.\n\nCheck out Asaravan on #SoundCloud\nhttps://on.soundcloud.com/ZkyMUsMUTN9WT7EIsS",

    "content": "The game itself doesn't really hold up that well, one of those games cooler to think about than to play in my personal opinion, though it was very innovative. The soundtrack is the clear highlight of the game, and though many of the tracks from the OST are just converted from the original Japanese Hydlide 3 to work with the soundchip on the Genesis, I think that the Genesis/Mega Drive Super Hydlide soundtrack in particular is a gem of its own with a lot of original tracks not found in any other version to my knowledge, and though it does suffer from the issues plaguing a lot of Genesis soundtracks and the newness of that particular console's FM synthesis techniques, I find most of the tracks compositionally excellent, and most do exceed the other versions of the tracks I've heard, including the arranged, orchestrated versions. Out of Freedom is my personal favorite track from the game, I just think it's got such a chill, almost elevator-muzak vibe that I even would listen to it when I woke up while having my coffee to help me think. So though this is a really rough take, I decided to give a shot at playing it with the tools I have to get rid of that GEMS-esque grit that the original has and bring it into a modern sound. Hopefully you think it's cool!",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve always loved how old RPGs had background music you could leave running for hours — it set the mood without ever demanding your attention. That inspired me to make something in the same spirit, but with a modern ambient twist.\n\nThis is a single track built around the 396Hz tone, stretched into a 5-hour loop. It’s not structured like a song with verses or drops — more of a soundscape that just flows and stays steady, the way pixel-era game music often did. I layered soft ambient pads with subtle textures to keep it alive, but kept it consistent so it works as background for studying, gaming, or just zoning out.\n\nIf you’re curious, here’s the link:  \n[https://youtu.be/MA\\_nI0imjj0?si=PxMAj4HzLIwHaYBk](https://youtu.be/MA_nI0imjj0?si=PxMAj4HzLIwHaYBk)\n\nI’d love to hear what you think — does it feel more like retro game ambience, meditation music, or somewhere in between?",

Why did you attend (or want to attend) a game music concert? (Is it because of the songs, or the experience itself maybe?)\n2. What relation to music do you have? (Are you a musician yourself or just an active listener?)\n3. What do you love the most about game music? (in comparison to classical music, for example)\n4. What are your favourite game music pieces? And did you play those games where the music is from? \n\nEven not for research I think these questions are interesting to have a discussion about, so feel free to debate and stuff in the replies.\n\nThank you for answering in advance and thank you for your time!",

And would get your approval to replace the original version.\n\nI recently found this fan remake of the entire [STAR WARS: Tie Fighter](https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_tie_fighter_special_edition) soundtrack, made by **Alexey Savelyev**, including the full 27 minutes of inflight music with all buildup and combat cues normally arranged in a dynamic gameplay-driven system, now composed into one big flowing track. To me it's the current perfect version of the original music. And unless someone makes a live orchestra version, this one is the definitive version to me.

I do not know much about the technical side of music so my apologies if I get terms wrong, I'll try my best to explain it.\n\nThere's this OST that I really like from an old Ps1 game called King's Field. The OST is called West Shore\n\n[https://youtu.be/GRn\\_gfltbhw?list=PLMHCGC8qP5422kYz3kVp8e2NiFfeMCA3m](https://youtu.be/GRn_gfltbhw?list=PLMHCGC8qP5422kYz3kVp8e2NiFfeMCA3m)\n\nThe second one comes from a strategy game called Age of Wonders 4. This OST is called Magic Mystery (Tomes of Magic Theme)\n\n[https://youtu.be/CPw6UEkDfYI?list=RDCPw6UEkDfYI](https://youtu.be/CPw6UEkDfYI?list=RDCPw6UEkDfYI)\n\nTheir beat, while going at different speeds, is the same, or so I feel. I asked ChatGPT since it may know much more about music than I do, and it said that it is the same minor 3-note rise and a similar slow pulse (KF is a bit faster).   \n  \nNow I'm curious if this is an intentional homage or just convergent vibes. Am I crazy for thinking they sound similar or something?",

Original game tracks that are already built like EDM would be preferred, but I realize most game pieces are not composed for dancing.\n\n[My list can be found here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3J0uvRtngirZUJemJivS1P?si=C3saresXQd6PAmGCicAHKw), if that can offer a better explanation of my style, or if anyone wants to listen to what I've put together so far. There isn't any real flow within the list, as I usually put it on shuffle, but I've listened to a lot of music to pull my favorites.",

    "content": "Back when I first played Pokémon Gold and Silver as a kid, I honestly didn’t think twice about the Ecruteak City theme. It was just background music while I ran through town.\n\nBut the other day, it randomly popped into my head after years of not hearing it and wow. Listening to it now, it feels so atmospheric and haunting in a way I never picked up on as a kid. It nails that traditional, mysterious vibe of Ecruteak perfectly.\n\nI think part of it is nostalgia, but part of it is just realizing how good the Gen 2 soundtrack really was. As a kid I rushed past it, but as an adult I actually feel it.\n\nCurious, does anyone else have a Pokémon track that you appreciate way more now than you did when you were younger?",

It really sounds like one of those royalty-free tracks (maybe Kevin MacLeod or something similar), but I can’t find it anywhere.\n\nDoes anyone recognize this track or know its title? Any help would be super appreciated 🙏\n\n🎵 Track Description\nThis is an instrumental piece about 55 seconds long, in stereo. The sound is very clean and minimal, most likely a royalty-free background track similar in style to Kevin MacLeod’s music.\n\nMood / Atmosphere: Light, cheerful, and a bit quirky — it feels upbeat without being too energetic. It has that “YouTube background music” vibe often used in vlogs, tutorials, or casual content.\n\nInstruments / Elements:\n\nA steady, simple rhythmic base (probably percussion or light clapping).\n\nA playful melodic line (likely keyboard/synth or pizzicato strings).\n\nBackground harmony that keeps the tone bright and non-intrusive.\n\n\nOverall Style: Fun, slightly cartoonish, “innocent mischief” type of track. It could easily belong to an album of comedic, lighthearted, or casual royalty-free music.",

So, let me introduce him.\n\nI think everyone knows Galaga.\n\nHowever, few people know the person who composed Galaga’s music.\n\nFew people also know who composed the music for Pole Position, New Rally X, Mappy, Bosconian, Libble Rabble and Metrocross.\n\nThe music for all of these games was composed by just one person, Nobuyuki Ohnogi. \n\nBecause I also didn't know that, I was very surprised when I learned that Ohnogi composed much of the music for classic namco games I loved.\n\nBefore Ohnogi entered the video game industry, video games had nothing like music, just simple sound effects and melodies, but what Ohnogi created was \"game music\" that stands alone as a complete song.\n\nIn addition to composing game music, Ohnogi also served as producer for many game music albums, making a significant contribution to the formation of Japan's game music market.\n\nUnfortunately, Ohnogi passed away from illness in 2019, but there is no end to the number of game composers who respect him, and in Japan he is remembered with the utmost respect as the \"father of game music.\"",

My absolute favorite soundtrack at the moment is the Crown Country ost and Murder of Crows. Ockeroid really hits a certain feel with that soundtrack that im wanting more of and im now on the hunt. ive actually been listening to that soundtrack almost daily since i played the game last october and i am in love with it!\n\nso im needing some reccomendations for soundtracks that have that horror, unsettling feel with that older, nostalgic feel to it. im super nostalgic for the ps1/n64 era of video game soundtracks since those were my first consoles. It can be old or new games, especially since that era is gaining popularity and more people are making games in the style of that era today. i just love the feel of music form that era or that is inspired by that era of video games, like the Crow Country ost. \n\nany recommendations are appreciated ahead of time!",

    "content": "So WAY back  in the  mid-2000's, I downloaded five songs off the internet, labeled  \"Super  Mario  RPG  Arranged.\"    The  tracklist  is:\n\n1. Seeing a  Dream  Through a  Window  of  Stars\n2. Mushroom  Kingdom\n3. The  Drunkard  Song\n4. Beware  the  Forest's  Mushrooms\n5. Mesmorizing  Mammaries  (linked)\n\nThese songs  are  credited  to  Yoko  Shimomura.  Very  notably, this specific version of \"Beware the Forest's Mushrooms\" (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4GmvtRff8M&amp;list=RDH4GmvtRff8M&amp;start_radio=1)) was later cited as having been planned for Super Smash Bros. Brawl.  This of course was a couple years AFTER I already had the songs downloaded, so clearly it was not made originally for Brawl.    What  is  unclear is  if  they  were  actually  going to use this version, or if it is  being paraded  around  as  what  \"could\"  have  been the  version cut  from  Brawl.\n\nAnyway, these five songs do not appear  in  VGMDB  at  all.   I  was wondering if  anybody  on Reddit  might know where they originally came from?",

Progress on the game has been smooth and going well, although I do not have any musical skills to compose or write music. That's why I am asking the people of this subreddit if they can lend me their skills to help me with this game! I know its a lot to ask to make a soundtrack of a game for free, but i do intend on paying via Kickstarter.

    "content": "Hey all,\n\nWe’re a small team working on Guardians of the Wild Sky, and we've had the opportunity to collaborate with composer Andreas Waldetoft. For fellow devs with limited resources, how do you decide which instruments or moments to prioritize for live recording? \n\nBecause our soundtrack budget is tight, we had to take on a more thoughtful and layered approach by:\n\n1. Starting with MIDI mockups with virtual instruments and getting the foundational arrangement right.\n2. Adding live players selectively and focusing on where acoustic nuance truly elevates the track.\n\nOur first live-instrument test featured flutes performed by the very talented [Sandro Friedrich](https://www.powerflute.ch/), who we previously worked with on our game, Valley. Everything you’ll hear is still fairly rough and unfinished. Some of the music will go through proper mixing and polish before launch. But even in this early state, the addition of live flutes completely changed the track’s energy compared to the mockup. \n\n* Live Flute Version: [https://youtu.be/z5kozEWs3fw](https://youtu.be/z5kozEWs3fw) \n\nWe’ve also improvised on the budget by tapping into internal talent. For example, our Technical Director or co-founder Brenden Frank (who also has a knack for making music) recorded piano renditions to flesh out the quieter, nighttime sequences. These simple takes help keep the atmosphere dense and emotional without the cost of hiring more players.\n\n* Andreas’ WIP Version (No Piano): [https://youtu.be/U0tKBOVDfzc](https://youtu.be/U0tKBOVDfzc) \n* Brenden’s Version (Live Piano): [https://youtu.be/O6n6DhVo4f8](https://youtu.be/O6n6DhVo4f8) \n\nThis was a good reminder that sometimes one or two carefully chosen live instruments can really carry a track. Curious to hear how others here have handled making soundtracks on a budget.",

It analyzes a MIDI, detects individual voices inside chords (highest to lowest notes), and automatically splits them into clean, monophonic tracks with clear filenames. It also logs track numbers, instruments, and pitch events, so you know exactly what’s going on under the hood. Whether you’re arranging, orchestrating, remixing, or just curious how a piece is structured, MIDIBreakout makes messy MIDIs way easier to work with.

    "content": "I was listening to Koji Kondo’s desert-themed tracks from Super Mario games, like “Dry Dry Ruins” from Paper Mario and “Lethal Lava Land” from Super Mario 64, and something struck me: the atmosphere feels strangely reminiscent of The Beatles’ “Within You Without You.”\n\nFor context, “Within You Without You” is from Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and is heavily influenced by Indian classical music, with meditative instrumentation and a spacious, hypnotic vibe.\n\nKondo has cited jazz fusion and world music as influences in interviews, but there’s no direct evidence linking this Beatles track to his Mario compositions. Still, it’s interesting to think about possible stylistic overlaps:\n\n1. Both tracks use evocative, atmospheric instrumentation to transport listeners to a different “world.”\n\n2. There’s a hypnotic, almost otherworldly quality in the rhythm and melody that mirrors a sense of desert isolation.\n\n3. The mood and pacing in Kondo’s desert themes feel contemplative and immersive, similar to the meditative tone of “Within You Without You.”\n\nCould this be a subconscious nod, or just a coincidence? I’d love to hear what others think! Do you hear any similarities? Are there other influences in Kondo’s music that remind you of the Beatles or other world music?",

I had never heard of it before, or the game, and on first glance I assumed it was a personal project, not a game soundtrack. The cover art doesn’t necessarily look like it was related to a game. For reference it’s for a game called Tsugunai: Atonement, released by Atlus in NA on PS2 in 2001. Got middling reviews I’m gathering. \n\nAnyway, it’s a nice soundtrack. Feels like what Mitsuda would have created with more capable sound hardware, after his PS1 golden era. Won’t say it’s his best work (that will always go to Chrono Trigger), but anyone looking for more content from a treasured era of game music, def worth a listen. Celtic style. \n\nhttps://music.apple.com/us/album/an-cinniuint-tsugunai-%E3%81%A4%E3%81%90%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84-original-soundtrack/1530312276",

    "content": "i m not well versed in music theory, but i love listening to people just rant about it, especially when talking about VGM, but as content creators noticed there s viewership interested in VGM reactions, especially the \"LISTENING FOR THE FIRST TIME\" ones since there's this sense of \"omg they re gonna feel what i felt when i heard it for the first time\", i feel this type of content became more and more superficial, to a point it's just like \"yo nice song\", \"is this &gt;insert odd time signature&lt;? (proceeds to count the beats)\", then bro tries to play along and gives no thought on what they thought was interesting, or you expect them to comment on a specific aspect of the theme and they just ignore it.  \n also the fact that the context of the scene/battle the theme is being used might have a huge impact on the actual theme, so going to a blind full ost listening can be pretty underwhelming, when you don't know what the theme is about. Usually they don't even do a basic research on the game nor the composer.\n it just gets to a point where i'm just watching a dude listening to something i like and not adding anything to it. Oh cool that you can play along to it just from listening, but that means nothing, i know that you know how music works, but you re not passing any of that knowledge by just going \"hey guys that's a V chord, look i know music theory\"\n I know it s basic clickbait/algorithm grind, but idk it's just a personal thing cuz i invested into music because of videogames and channels like insaneintherain, 8 bit music theory, videogame music fanfare, and it just baffles me that some of the most viewed vgm content are these reactions that are literally nostalgia bait because \"omg he s listening to something i like\" but he s probably gonna forget about it the moment he ends the stream.  \n anyway sorry for the rant, i know it's dumb, just needed to get it out of my system.",

You only have to rename the files containing it.  Further it uses IFF-Bitmaps and WAV-sounds, so all assets are accesable.\n\nThe Game may be not the best, but the Soundtrack is surprisingly good.\n\nAbout the Game itself: Its a Platformer that scrolls in \"flipped screens\", and is centered around martial arts.\n\nYou can walk left and right and climp ladders with the arrow-keys. control jumps and alt punches.\n\nIf you punch while holding the direction you are facing in midair, you make a kick, that basically acts as a horicontal **dash**. This dash however gives you a slight increase in high, so it is necessary to do this mid-jump to gain more hight. Try to get onto the roofes of the starting village.\n\nThe Game uses an East Asian Martial Art setting and not a Cowboy-Cop/Cyperpunk-Dystopia in Australia, as the name may have mislead you. In fact you have to search for \"Mad Mac 2 -max\" to get something meaningful.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSygK7vlIU&amp;list=PLIRXLBCcOXPhhiVdC547VMVlnIb8iFxgX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TSygK7vlIU&amp;list=PLIRXLBCcOXPhhiVdC547VMVlnIb8iFxgX)\n\n[https://www.mobygames.com/game/147993/mad-mac-2/](https://www.mobygames.com/game/147993/mad-mac-2/)\n\n[https://www.myabandonware.com/game/mad-mac-2-pf1](https://www.myabandonware.com/game/mad-mac-2-pf1) \n\n[https://www.retrolorean.com/de/mad-mac-2-31532](https://www.retrolorean.com/de/mad-mac-2-31532) \n\n[https://ogdb.eu/index.php?section=title&amp;titleid=66624](https://ogdb.eu/index.php?section=title&amp;titleid=66624)",

It’s a story-driven visual novel about love, friendship, and the quiet moments that change who you become.\n\nThe track plays in one of the opening scenes, set in a quiet Cambridge classroom on a warm July afternoon. I wanted to capture that mid-2000s nostalgia, the feeling of being young, uncertain, and completely alive.\n\nWould love to hear what you think about the atmosphere or mood. I’m always curious how people interpret game themes out of context.",

In any case, what I'm trying to find out is why there are so few of them (that I know of) while it's an established genre in cinema and live art.
