She is in university (I can't remember what she is studying) and every year they hold a race. If you are last place, then you have to wear a turtle shell at the next race. \nOne day she is being bullied by some of the other students. So she decides to run away. \nAt the same time you are shown a very popular pop star. He broke off his engagement maybe a week prior and this is the 1st time he has been out (I think) anyways he is being chased by the paparazzi.\nAnyways they both look back at their chasers as they go around a corner. Which means they bump into each other and as he is falling on top of her their lips touch. \nWhich obviously the paparazzi snap a photo.\nHe stole her first kiss. \nThen it is all over the place, everyone knows about it. \nBut instead of telling everyone what had happened. They say they are engaged!\nFast forward his ex has a new lover and they don't believe he is actually in love with the girl. So they decide to have a rock concert. If the ex wins it proves they aren't in love and the whole engagement is fake. If the popstar wins then they will stay engaged.\nThe night before the concert her grandfather shows her their family recipe. Lucky pasta. \nTo make the pasta, you need to think only about who you are making the pasta for.\nShe ends up being up all night making pasta because she doesn't know who she wants to win.\n\nPlease help 😭 it's such a a fun silly show and I want to share it",

(Think high school frenemy closeness and tension haha)\n\nI love the idea of one having moved on (or convinced himself he did) and the other showing up determined to get him back especially if the one is againt it or dating someone else but the other umm (can't think of the right word) like hits all the right spots?? Not just intimately  but just knows him so well. Like knows what he wants or needs even if the tried to deny it? Like proving he is the best to take care of him? Hope that makes sense.\n\nEx morning kinda gave me this vibe not exactly but close. The ex knew how to handle him, when to push and when not to and I loved the fact they both clearly loved each other still and them having so much tension not just good sexual kind but also anger regret too.  So I'm looking for more Linda like that. \n\nWhile this is aimed towards bl. If you know non bl that fights this so well you have to rec it, I'll watch it too. \n\nThanks. ",

    "content": "I don't know how many people here use MyDramaList, but I've been on that site since 2018 after watching my first two dramas - Dark Blue &amp; Midnight and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon.\n\nI used to love the site as I could easily have actual in-depth discussions with other users about currently airing shows, without a difference in opinion causing outrage, or random users spamming comment sections with moral policing. At times, it would be like exchanging opinions through essays when there was a lot to discuss, and that was wonderful.\n\nHowever, the site has exploded in size even since 2018, and with that has come so many problems. Where contributions used to be easy to add, they now require in-depth sourcing because of trolls. Bots and trolls have become big problems. Moral policing in morally grey dramas' comment sections is rampant, and where a reply used to be an exciting opportunity for discussion, it brings the anxiety of whether or not someone has somehow been offended.\n\nNowadays, half of the comment sections feel like the impression I have of twitter as someone who has never even used twitter.\n\nJust yesterday, I responded politely and positively to someone's comment, only to get nasty conclusions drawn about my character? For reference, this person said they found a show to be too heavy for their usual taste in gay romance (totally fair comment), but that the show stood out positively within the genre of drama. I said how this was exactly what got me excited about the show as it sets a standard for normalising queerness without it being the main theme of a show, and received a response that had clearly taken my words as a personal attack. I was called an \"entitled brat\" whose \"careful choice of words\" has been used to infer the original commenter was \"an uncultured swine\".\n\nI had never had any intent to offend, and this is likely the most strongly negative (and personal) response I've had for simply expressing an opinion about a show. When commenting I am always careful about how I word things specifically to avoid causing offence, yet apparently that act in itself has become offensive to some.\n\nIf you've read all that, thank you. I'm also wondering whether others here who use MyDramaList have come across the same problems more and more recently? I would also be very open to recommendations of other places to discuss dramas in an open and friendly way.\n\nIf people would like to judge by the original comments, I am happy to add them. For reference, I have no qualms about being told I was in the wrong, and have already apologised to the user as my intent was never to cause offence.",

In the school you have the main three rebels (the two girls and boy) ,you also meet another shy boy in there class who they take under there wing .You also have the blonde girl (if I remember correctly she is usually wearing pig tails )and then another main character you see is another rebellious boy (think he rides a motorbike )who does not get along with the main boy actor in the series .Whilst all the main plot is going on you start to see the main boy actor and main girl actor with short hair start to develop feelings for one another .You also have the blonde haired girl and other rebellious boy (one which rides the bike )develop feelings for each other .The other main girl who is in the group at the start has feelings for the smart boy that left to change schools /moved at the beginning of the series once he returns .I’m pretty sure even the male home room teacher ends up having a love interest with one of the female teachers at the school .  \n\nI can remember some other small bits a pieces so please help me find the name of this drama cause it’s driving me crazy I haven’t watched it in so long ,if you have any questions I will try and answer as best as possible .tysmmmmm (sorry for spelling mistakes or if it’s worded perhaps wrong).",

I only saw a clip, and i think it was a chinese drama, but i struggle with remembering faces, so not positive it was.\n\nThe clip was at night, a guy and a girl.\n\nThe guy had short hair, and the girl had glasses i think. Also medium to short hair length, I think. The guy was following behind her and asked her name, which i think she didnt reply too. So he says \"we kissed, can i know your name\" or \"we already kissed, cant you tell me your name?\" Something along those lines. I want to say they were probably in highchool, the girl looked like she was wearing a school uniform potentially. If anyone can help me find this, i'd be really greatful!! &lt;3.\n\np.s. no i cant find the clip, i looked for like an hour with no luck :(\n\n  \nP.p.s Tiktok came in clutch, i found the movie, it is called Better Days (2019) and it IS in fact a Chinese drama.",

On the hike the wife falls and gets badly injured so the husband goes back to the convenience store to convince the girl to be a stand in for his wife until she recovers.\n\nThe dad of the main character gambles their house and store to loan sharks so the girl takes the offer of the man and pretend she’s moving to Australia for work all while moving in and learning how to pretend to be this man’s wife.\n\nIf more details are needed I can provide them as I pretty much remember all the details of this show despite watching it once I just cannot for the life of me find the name of it.

I really liked:\n- The untamed\n- The double\n- The princess Gambit\n- When I fly towards you\n- Tale of the Nine tailed\n- Lovely runner\n- Extraordinary Attorney Woo\n- Alchemy of souls \nFeel free to deviate and recommend any dram you find good too!

(no spoilers)\nThis really made me think of Welcome To Waikiki (k-drama), the scene is also in the last episode, where Lee Joon-Ki (Lee Yi-kyung) has to bond with a turtle for an addition.🤣\n\nI keep thinking of what Dylan Wang's reaction to this scene was before acting the actual scene, which in the storyline is very different than my thought process. \nI keep on laughing because of that scene about Lee Joon-Ki and the turtle, and if Dylan's reaction was the same as the character in Waikiki, Lee Joon-Ki. Gosh I loved every Lee Joon-Ki moment in that k-drama. 🤣\n\nOf course for those who has seen both this would be more helpful to understand, if not I'm sorry.\n\nWelcomes to Waikiki is one of my favourite k-dramas and I felt like I couldn't stop myself.\nAlso if you haven't seen Welcome to Waikiki, please go ahead and promise you will have a good laugh 😂",

    "content": "So this is a discussion but im also raging a bit.\nShould I start with the drama that pissed me off. \nWhy the hell did Junichi die in the end. Wtf. I mean I get it his love should be fetal, not a happy end and he can't escape his past i guess. However he tried to change to get a better life so why did they killed him off. Also it has been a year matanabe or whatever his name was (i think he stabbed him, the video quality wasn't good). Nanami didn't love you accept it and move on already. And she ended up with his child and as a single mother. Did she make bad decisions by wanting to be with him? Anyway I enjoyed the first half of the drama more then the last 5 eps. This whole thing were they run from the police was whatever and that thing with the boss was kinda annoying. When I rewatch it then only those eps. The ending track was good tho at least that 😭\nSo now to Learning to Love. This drama was pretty good imo. Could it be longer so that the characters could've been more developed? Yeah! And I wanted to see more cute moments with Taiga and Manami. But I still had fun watching it bcs I loved the premise. I also thaught that Tsubasa would end up together with Nanamis friend idk y. What I don't understand is why didn't we get a epilogue were Taiga becomes a train driver? And or were Manami and Taiga got married?!? It felt kind of incomplete at the end.",

There is also other story lines i believe regarding her roommates and their love life’s. Like I know one of them falls for this athletic guy. But the study does surround the main girl. There is also a love triangle regarding I believe her and classmate and the TA. The last episode ends with her having to make a choice and they never show who she picks. There was only one season and I don’t think they ever had plans to make a season 2 but I wanna rewatch. I think I watched in on Netflix maybe 4 years ago.

Her entire family was killed presumably by the ML and her father wasn't able to say everything before he was executed but he told the FL something about the prince or a Duke I don't remember (but it was the ML). This ML was actually investigating something but all of them were framed before they were able to gather the evidence. The FL was only saved because she married ML. They actually were genuinely in love, but the politics ruined it. Both of them were reborn before the tragedy happened and she started avoiding ML, and then tried to be with SML who is also in love with her, but also happened to be a pawn. Later both ML and FL found out they were both reborn. This is as far as I remember.\n\nThank you 🙏🏻 \n",

I was wondering if any of y'all had recommendations for good romantic Asian dramas that are similar to Kyo x Tohru from the anime *Fruits Basket* or like Sesshomaru x Rin from *Inuyasha* in terms of the romantic dynamic. The male lead that is tsundere (either hot-tempered like Kyo or stoic like Sesshomaru - would love recommendations for both!) and finds the female lead annoying at first, maybe even dislikes her completely at the start, but his heart softens because of her kindness. Maybe a \"she fell first, but he fell harder\" sort of thing. I'm a sucker for that dynamic lol But yes, any tsundere male lead x kind gentle female lead dramas please!

Her mother runs this laundry shop, she delivers some clothes back to the male leads house, they go to same school....in this time she realises how she was busy in working before transporting back and was not able to give her time to her mom. Now i don't remember most of the storyline but there was one thing when both male lead and female lead were on the day of giving college entrance exam something happened like probably one of them fainted in exam hall as they thought the other one was in an accident i don't remember what happened exactly(my memory is pretty vague about this drama). It might be a youtube drama as well, so if you guys know it's name let me know. Thank you!!",

It honestly felt like they had finished and someone walked in and was like crap we need a few more eps...and they tossed this in. \n\nAnd omg this bugged me so fucking bad, mostly because the emperor already knew!! He knew the  general loved her before she was a general and then when she became a general, he even seemed ok with it when she announced who she really was in court in front of everyone. He never seemed bothered then all the sudden this guy comes in says one sentence and suddenly he is tearing apart his two most loyal general's. And to top it off it was after finding out how his trusted minister was manipulating him for personal greed and yet he just does it again. And not even in a way that seems logical. Like telling them his postion and maybe saying hey her army had been fucked over and her general's killed why don't both of you just take over his father's legacy together. No he does it by putting them againt each other (in order to protect each other) and just randomly decided he should arrange for her to marry someone else. Like wtf. That's how you get ur trusted loyal people to hate u. Sorry rant over haha\n\nBut shadow love is doing it too. He seemed to start to understand she was in love with someone else and that he should focus on his country and then he becomes emperor and decided force and blackmail are thr best way to make her his. And I just can't...\n\nSo please someone give me a story where the 3rd wheel either realizes they aren't meant to be but stays friends or he meets someone  else and falls in love.",

However, the caption mentioned they were exes at the time so this was a charged moment.\n\nThe second video was a compilation of moments where Ria was mad and hitting people, and Sarah was the only one who could calm her down.\n\nFrom the two scenes it gave me the impression that Ria is in charge of \"something\".

But after episodes 4-5 plot felt all over the place, might call it a skill issue but, i kind of started to forget some details as there were too many and also felt mildly confused. \nHonestly this should've been a 16 episodes long series because, episodes 11 &amp; 12 felt rushed. There was too much plot and only 2 episodes to cram it all together. And no offence I personally feel like the drama should've ended right after suzy's character died. Because, everything became too cringe after they rebooted her as a genie. even her character became cringe. And lastly not enough kisses and fluff sadly. \n\nAll the cameo roles were top notch. I was so suprprised to see song hye Kyo, daniel herney, and kim ji hoon. I really liked daniel herney and kim ji joons roles, their scenes were funny as hell and emotional too.\n\nkim woo bin looked amazing in longer hair he should definitely grow his hair out.\n\nActing was good overall and, our beloved ajumma debuted as halmoni in this series😂\n\nI genuinely hope they bring back this duo once again.",

Like, can they at least look like they’re physically attracted to each other? 😂 It often feels like the female lead is in pain whenever the male lead kisses her.\n\nI like female leads who are comfortable being themselves and can just be natural around the male lead, when their conversations flow easily and it feels real.\n\nDramas I didn’t like: Amidst a Snowstorm of Love, Love O2O (the storylines just felt too weak for me).\nDramas I like: Hidden Love, True Beauty, Bon Appetit, Your Majesty.\n\nI want something that makes me cry, laugh, and giggle! 🥹💞",

    "title": "Need post-surgery Recommendations!",
    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am having surgery (not too excited about it), pretty soon, and will be forced to lie still for 2 months basically. Well, from the gist of it, I believe the first month is the most serious, where I cannot get up or really move my back at all. The second I can try and start moving little by little for a couple minutes here or there, even getting up slowly to use the bathroom, etc, but still must lay 99% of my time to recover. \n\nAnyway! Sorry for rambling. \n\n**I would like to add some recommendations to my watch list to help get me through this recovery period. I do have some preferences for what I watch, so allow me to share my preferences in shows I like or dislike:**\n\n*- I pretty much only like romance dramas (not sure why, but I tend to like the romantic dramas lol), but I enjoy most genres, as long as the show features a central romance.*\n\n*- I heavily dislike love triangles when they overstay their welcome. I can deal with them if it is: 1. Resolved quickly, 2. Lasts a while, but it is very obvious to characters who are the chosen ones, and it never really interferes with the lead romance*\n\n*- I heavily dislike misunderstandings in the same way I dislike triangles above. Especially goofy misunderstandings that could be resolved with a single sentence of conversation between characters. So if the show features a lot of misunderstandings that last too long or are not quickly resolved, I get annoyed and usually drop it.* \n\n*- Same for breakups when the characters finally become romantic. There is nothing that grinds my gears more than when I spend an entire show to see leads admit their feelings finally, then something happens where they break up until the last freakin episode and get back together in the last 10 minutes...* \n\n*- I also prefer happy endings (even though I do love a good tear-jerker, I just hope it has a happy ending after it all lol)*\n\n**Things that I like that aren't necessary, but are bonus points (I can't be too picky since I need a nice list to get through 2 months lol), so if you think a show would be nice to watch that fits my interests, you can disregard this list if the show doesn't have these:**\n\n*- I like some cliche moments tbh. I am not afraid to admit it. Like the casual protective moments between love interests, etc. (especially those moments where the ml or fl helps the other in trouble, from something simple like tripping and catching them, to something more insane like saving their life from danger)*\n\n*- I love me some action/mystery/revenge type stuff, but in general, I like most genres added to romance.*\n\n*-Lately watched many shows where they get a second chance at life and get to relive to make it better and get revenge, etc. So if any other hidden shows like this, I'd 100% be down lol*\n\n*- There have been a few exceptions to my rules based on some of my favorite shows, so take that with a grain of salt, haha.* \n\n**Now, I will also try to make this easier if anyone has some recommendations for me, so here is a list of most shows I've already seen (I can't remember or find every show I've ever watched, but thanks to Viki and some other sites, I do have a playlist of \"watched already\" so I can list those out to help).**\n\n**I will also try to make a note of some of my favorite shows:**\n\n*-When destiny brings the demon (I loved this damn show so much, nearly perfect for me in checking boxes, just the ending was a bit rushed for me, but I loved it)*\n\n*-Love between fairy and devil (one of my favorites of all time, even though it does break some things on my list, I actually stuck with it and loved it so damn much)*\n\n*- Alchemy of souls (Loved it again, but once more, broke some rules on my list, which makes it impressive it's one of my favorites lol, especially since I needed 2 seasons to finish)*\n\n*-Are you human too?* \n\n*-my dearest nemesis*\n\n*-perfect marriage revenge (I already mentioned loving this plotline lol)*\n\n*-strong woman do bong soon (super fun)*\n\n*-the K2 (love the action)*\n\n*-Hotel Del Luna ( T\\_T )*\n\n*-My lovely liar*\n\n*-1% of something*\n\n*-my little happiness*\n\n*-beauty inside*\n\n*-go go squid!*\n\n*-be my princess (super fun)*\n\n*-the forbidden marriage*\n\n*-shooting stars*\n\n*-weightlifting fairy, kim bok-joo (super fun)*\n\n*-romance of a twin flower (remember really liking this one as well)*\n\n*-love in the moonlight*\n\n*-while you were sleeping*\n\n*-my lethal man (cool revenge)*\n\n*-Come and hug me* \n\n*-My love from the star*\n\n*-lawless lawyer (cool action)*\n\n*-cute bodyguard*\n\n*-he is psychometric*\n\n*-healer*\n\n*-shining for one thing (love it)*\n\n*-It's okay not to be okay (fantastic)*\n\n*-a Korean Odyssey* \n\n  \nThere are others. But unfortunately, the names and such are slipping my mind. \n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI apologize for the length of this post. I understand if you don't even give a recommendation lol. I just wanted to provide as much detail as possible to help find some shows I'd like. \n\nLike: romance, quick/smooth resolutions for love triangles and misunderstandings, happy endings.\n\nI appreciate any help in finding new shows!

The details I remember are these:\n\n* It was about a girl in a student dormitory. Yellow dormitory.\n* Then there's a scene where she goes to camp with her school or college.\n* She's kind of alone for a while, and I don't know what, people come out looking for her.\n* It has a kind of mystical air.\n* I remember there's a scene where she's locked out of the dormitory and wants to have some juice or tea.",

    "content": "(It's ok, if you liked it, everyone has a different opinion.)\n\nI know I'm late to this, but I just have to let out my frustration. XD \n\nFirst of all, I love this story, I know it's toxic and all, but I like it, I've watched the Anime, the Taiwanese (2001), Japanese (2005), Korean (2009) and Chinese (2018) version. In my opinion all versions have something good about them, but the Thai version....  \n\nI appreciate that they tried to modernize the story, making the development of the ML explicit, but the acting.......... IS SOOOO TERRIBLE! Domyouji Tsukasa is a very complex character, you have to express at least two different emotions at the same time (arrogance, vulnerability), so it's a very difficult role, it shouldn't be given to some random singer who can't act. Thyme is the lamest and most annoying Domyouji I've seen. The actor portraying Ren was also bad. He had two kinds of different facial expressions and that was it. The actress who playes Gorya was the best out of the actors. Gorya was smart and overall a great Tsukushi. The only thing disturbed me about her was the costant yelling. Like you dont have to yell all the time. But she was still the best part of the series, in my opinion. Everything else was just Mehh to me. It felt rushed sometimes and the storyline was a bit confusing, although I know the story. It lacked the romance and the depth. The F4 boys didn't have a good chemistry like in the other versions. There were a few funny moments and some interesting parts but since most of the actors couldnt play their roles well, I just couldnt get into it and it was hard to take it seriously.\n\nI know that many people liked it bc it's short and has an explicit character development of the main ML which the other versions don't have, but I don't understand how can you oversee the bad acting. All the other versions, even the Korean one, made me feel so many emotions. I laughed and cried, but the Thai version... it was just annoying or boring most of the time. Seeing all the positive reviews I thought it was gonna be good... I don't get it. \n\nI would love to see a modern version of this story that feels like 21 century and is actually good. They could make the ML just a rich arrogant brat who has anger issues without the physical violence. That would be interesting to see but WITH TALENTED ACTORS!",

This was because her sister was jealous of her, who had become the wife of the first minister and received all of his love. However, once she entered the palace, she was subjected to relentless torment. This unbalanced hatred eventually led her to murder her sister. When the emperor witnessed the death of the beautiful woman, he ordered his soldiers to stab her to death. Thus, both sisters died at the same time.

Then he fell in love with one of the hottest boy in school. Idk what his relationship with the boy. Because he did has romantic relationship with the boy. But the boy end up marry his twin sister later. After he turn adult, he probably found his  sexual orientation as male. He changed as male but i guess he never wanted to be a female (because his family reaction upon this changing was not a good one). Idk what happened. Probably somehow his twin husband found out all those teens era ,the person he had all those romance was with his wife twin because he end up pursuing his wife twin into sexual relationship. But the twin denies the relationship claimed he's straight. Later on, he finally marry a woman. But then he found out he had colon cancer because he peed blood.  Doc said probably side effect from all those pheromones pills he had been taking. After his family found out he had terminal illness, they make a peace with him. Then ,he had a baby with his wife just before he finally passed away from the cancer.  \n\nI watch this on youtube. But all written in Thai. At that time, the drama still new so there was no english subtitles provided.  But from all those acting, all these information is what i able to understand.",

I haven’t watched Korean dramas since around the **Goblin** and **Korean Odyssey** era even though I watched them a lot before stopping. I’ve been watching Chinese dramas lately. \n\nHowever, as I’m currently watching **Beyond the Bar** on a whim, I like the pacing and character dynamic so far for the following reasons:\n\n- Male and female leads don’t look and dress like “idols” \n- More mature plot and characters (not HS - I also like that the FL is not a damsel in distress and holds her own with the ML; older man/young woman age gap tends to be a plus for me especially with “mentorship” relationships)\n- Slow burn romance (where it’s a realistic build-up)  \n\nI heard that they toned down the romance in **BTB** due to the fan criticism of the ML and FL’s age gap in real life, but I wish they didn’t - their eye contact be chemistry-ing so far. 👀 \n\nOthers that I liked:\n\nKorean: **Goblin**, **Korean Odyssey**.\n\nChinese: **My Boss** (more when they were in the office as mentor/mentee), **Flourished Peony/In Name of Blossom** (I absolutely loved how both were highly capable and the build-up to their eventual courtship), **Love of Nirvana** (it didn’t need to be overtly passionate to be romantic), **The Legend of Shen Li**.\n\nJapanese: I’m rewatching **An Incurable Case of Love** (again, more of their mentor/mentee relationship - spoiler &gt;!especially when FL briefly left to become more competent after realizing she relied too much on ML!&lt;). Also looking forward to release of **Romantics Anonymous**. ",

Man \n\nThis is where it gets blurry , I think she was taken to an apartment where there were some other kids and the man raised them all together but that may be a different show. \n\nIf anyone knows wtf I’m talking about I’d be really appreciative thank you .

    "content": "Several years ago, I saw one season of a series, I think on Hulu, that was an older series that had just been released in America from Japan or Korea. It may have been based on a manga.\n\nIt starts out with a high school girl who is taking exams to go to university, but her father can’t afford the tuition. The father owns a small chicken delivery restaurant.\n\nWe learned that the father, in his previous life, was an enforcer for a gang. His gang boss wanted to merge with a rival gang, but this man didn’t agree for some reason and ended up killing the boss and most of the other rival gang. He fled and met a prostitute and was hidden away by her. He stayed in his small apartment and continued to request prostitutes to see him, but would only talk to them when they came over because he was waiting for the woman who saved him to be sent to his room. When the right woman finally is sent to him, they develop a relationship and have a small baby daughter.\n\nThis part is hazy in my memory, but it seems the family was in a truck in the winter and got in an accident and the father and the baby girl survived believing that the mother had died. It seems at the end of the final episode of season one there was a hint that the woman may be alive.\n\nI hope I’m remembering this correctly. I have been searching for this for several years to see if there is a follow up to this first season that has been released in America. If anyone out there can identify the series I’m talking about I would be grateful. ",

But i've noticed that most stories I can find are from Thai BL's such as KinnPorsche, Love In the Air, Tharn &amp; Type or Chinese Bromances like The Untamed (MDZS), Scumbag System, or Spirealm. But not a lot of non-bl/bro themed C or K dramas. I recently went looking for something for Buried Hearts (that ending is killing me) and I couldn't find anything, so I searched Vincenzo, which had a good number, and the I tried Big Mouth which had like 12 lol. And I'm kinda sad about it because I would love to be able to read stories for some of these fandoms. \n\nAnyways it got me super curious about who else looks for them? or if anyone writes them? of if there are some somewhere other than AO3. \n\nIf you have a favorite drop me a link.

    "content": "So years ago, probably back around 2017 or so, I was scrolling on Facebook and at the time I had a lot of clips of different dramas popping up to watch. There were two distinctive ones that I recall to this day, and im dying to fins one of them. Over the years since seeing the clip I've searched but cant seem to find it. The other one for those curoous was The Great Queen Seondeok, and it was amazing(im actually rewatching I right now).\n\nAll I can remember are bits and pieces now of the second one, and I could be remembering it wrong. But this is it:\n\nA bunch of girls are doing some tests, or maybe they're challenges, and they're all dressed in yellow I believe. I cant remember if its to be a concubine or what but I think it had something to do with the prince.\nOne test included a writing an excerpt from a passage, or a poem thing from memory amd then signing your name to claim your work. Only problem is, our girl either couldn't read or  couldnt write her name or something, so she uses a stamp with her name on it. There's another girl doing the tests and challenges too that doesn't like our fl, so she's doing what she can to get her eliminated. One thing she does in another challenge, where the girls are made to wash their faces to show they have natural beauty is she puts something on FL's washcloth i think to male it look like shes wearing makeup so shes eliminated, but another girl helps her out so she doesnt.\n\nThats all i can remember, other than i think they have to cross a super high suspension bridge, but that might be for a different drama lol\n\nIf anyone recognizes these scenes at all please please help! I really want to watch it and I have for years but I've never been able to find it.\nThank you in advance to anyone who answers!",

The main character is (I think) a cop. There’s a storyline where corrupt politicians are involved in drugging young women who work in nightlife/entertainment.\n\nAt one point, the women are placed in a glass room, where the politicians watch them. The women are addicts, so they’re desperate and excited to finally get their dose. But this time, the criminals inject them with a new kind of drug, which causes some of them to die.\n\nThe main character’s daughter was also among these women and ends up being injected as well. In the climax, the father fights back, kills the perpetrators, saves his daughter, and gets her treated.\n\nDoes anyone know which drama this is?\n",

    "title": "Marry my Husband (Japanese version) Review",
    "content": "What do you think about this review and would be thankful if can suggest any platform where I can write and discuss dramas / movies or any other content.\n\nRecently I came across a J-drama which starred Takero Satoh in the lead role - giving me a  crucial reason to not skip it. Before starting in, I did a quick research on it and the storyline wasn't the most impressive one with themes revolving around time travel - changing future - getting cheated on by friend &amp; husband.\nThus, without any expectations I dived in to  watch this series. 🙂 Storyline can be termed as predictable but execution was done beautifully and at moments was a pleasant surprise.Origianlly our leads weren't meant to be together but as they interact more iin their time travelled back life we realize they were meant to be for each other always. The thing which held their connection earlier was that one of them didn't try to look beyond the bonds she was trapped in while the other one never dared to take an initiative. Ah, some realizations coming and hitting us , aren't they ? \n⚠️ If you are into classic trope of J-dramas with introvert romance then this is the right fit.\nMore than a love story, it the journey of main characters to break the patterns which have shackled them.\nCharacter development and cinematography are it's core strengths with a complimenting narrative style.  This can be attributed to a style which is close to life and not solely imaginative. You can relate to characters' emotions and intent.\nFurthermore, there are ways highlighted through which one can gradually bring in changes. But the catch for that is, you have to pick those points by your own. They are just there but you need to see. 🙂\nStory's focal point i.e main leads are Misa Kanbe and Wataru Suzuki( till end didn't realize his name is Wataru  😂 ). It is mainly Misa's journey from low self esteem to gaining back her confidence and altering the course of her life with silent support of Mr.Suzuki.This is commendable in a way that it is not showing Misa is a damsel in distress and Suzuki comes as the knight in shining armour and alter it all for her. He was there for her to support her , guide her at times but it was Misa most of the time taking the action. This touches an important concept that if you want to bring in changes I'm your life or alter it, you are the one who would need to take that step. People loving you would be there for you but you are the one  who need to realize and respond at the end.\nMoreover, another thing which I would consider pivotal was Misa's wardrobe transformation. It happened in a subtle way , it wasn't rushed at all or something like Suzuki takes her to someone and ask them to do her makeover like we have already seen in tons of movies. It was something which Misa initiated by herself and let it happen at her own pace. It played a key part her in confidence journey. And shed light on how dressing up well can influence one's perception about themselves and their lives.it felt like with the change in wardrobe a new Misa was born. Thus the power of a good wardrobe personalized to your own self is unmatchable.\n\nAlthough Misa was the main character but the writers / makers didn't hesitate to subtly point that she had her own flaws. One thing which her frenemy ( yes I am using that word )  Reina pointed about her character was that she has this habit of victimising herself... Thinking she is at the loosing end although she is not. Due to that constant victimising attitude she was suffering way more than she should have  actually.  And somewhat many of us unintentionally fall in that trap. We victimize ourselves and put the blame on external factors for our life circumstances. But with shfit in mindset, things started to take a favourable turn for Misa. Thus again giving us a reminder and reality check. \nThen comes Tomoya, Misa's husband which had least likeable traits competing with Reina in this. However, Reina's backstory can make you understand your her psyche. For Tomoya, things were lot decent but he decided to live a life as a dependent and that only ruined him but others around too. Again a common unfavorable humane tendency being pointed out. I wished a different ending for Tomoya but a closure would be possible in the ending we were given.\nNow let's talk something about the noble son.😊(Iykyk) Suzuki wasn't that loud hero but more of a silent hero with his own charm. There was a beautiful and serene energy which he brought. Undoubtedly, he was one of the most secure characters I have seen. Neither desperate nor jealous, just accepted it what is meant for him will be there for him and acting as his best self in all situations except for some with Tomoya. But anyways that character needed some medicine. \nNow let's put the spotlight on noble son.😊(Iykyk) Suzuki wasn't that loud hero but more of a silent hero with his own charm. There was a beautiful and serene energy which he brought. Undoubtedly, he was one of the most secure characters I have seen. Neither desperate nor jealous, just accepted it what is meant for him will be there for him and acting as his best self in all situations except for some with Tomoya. But anyways that character needed some medicine. \n\nWith  all these plus points there were some loopholes in ending episodes in terms of execution but I'm letting it go as the story was based on time travel concept which itself don't hold any real basis.\nThus, I would d give it a overalls rating of 8.5 /10. 😊 And a verdict that it can turn out as your comfort show if you decide to look beyond the typical storyline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Hi everyone! We’re part of the Bugaboo TV team and excited to share a spoiler-free review of **THE‑MAEKHONG‑CONNECTION (แคน2แผ่นดิน)**—a thrilling blend of action, drama, family secrets, and mythical quests. This isn’t a promotional post—just a heartfelt recommendation for lovers of gripping Thai dramas with English subtitles, especially those who enjoy tales rich in emotion, legacy, and adventure.\n\n**Synopsis  🎶**\n\nTwo royal brothers—Khenphet and Kaenchai—are torn apart by a violent political coup in their homeland, Wiangfa. Lost in the Mekong River and grappling with amnesia, they grow up worlds apart: one raised on the road of duty and sacrifice, the other forged in the shadows of crime. Decades later, their paths collide when the hunt for their ancestral treasure—a secret hidden in a mystical “golden khaen”—brings love, danger, loyalty, and betrayal into sharp, emotional focus. \n\n**Why It’s Worth Watching**\n\n* **Dual Heroes with Contrasting Worlds**Khenphet, raised as the honorable cop Raphin, embodies law and dedication; while Kaenchai, molded into a cunning outlaw, walks a darker path. Their sibling bond is fraught with tension, longing, and destiny. \n* **An Epic Treasure Hunt Meets Family Drama**The golden khaen serves both as key to a hidden fortune and family’s lost legacy. The race to claim—or protect—it unfolds through dangerous alliances and honorable sacrifices. \n* **Action Scenes That Pop**Expect explosive standoffs, daring escapes, forest treks, and dramatic rescues. Actress Mimew (playing Pimsai) even tackled a cliff-fall scene—even though she’s scared of heights! \n* **Top Ratings &amp; Cultural Buzz**The series opened with a bang—scoring the highest debut rating on Channel 7 HD for the first half of 2023 (5.1), and ended up tied for the channel’s highest average rating of the year (4.3) along with another hit, “Ployng Phrai.” \n\n**Considerations**\n\n* **Emotionally Intense**Sibling loss, identity crises, and dire stakes—this one goes deep. If heavy family drama isn’t your thing, proceed with tissues at the ready.\n* **Plot Complexities**The story juggles politics, crime syndicates, ancestral curses, and romantic entanglements—stick with it to follow the layered arcs.\n\n**Availability**\n\nOriginally aired on Channel 7 HD from **June 22 to August 24, 2023** . It’s available for streaming now with English subtitles on Bugaboo TV Premium.\n\n**Let’s Discuss!**\n\nDid you catch the emotional payoffs when the brothers finally reconvene? What did you think of the chase for the golden khaen—treasure or legacy? Loved the action, or did the dramatic twists get to you? If you’re into stories where fate, family, and fight collide, **THE-MAEKHONG-CONNECTION** is one to watch.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n— **Bugaboo TV Team**",

I wouldn't even know where to begin with which are my favorites, I've watched so many.\n\nAfter recently falling in love with *Cinderella Closet*, I'm hoping to find more recommendations for Asian dramas for fashion and modeling lovers that have this vibe or one similar to the US film *The Devil Wears Prada*.\n\nSub or dub, I have zero preference there. I'd love to discover more Japanese drams but watch many Korean ones and even enjoy Chinese dramas and others, so no preference there either. I prefer shows to film but I'm ready to enjoy either!\n\nThank you in advance.",

Something happens and she ends up living with a friend of her mothers as her mother has died or has been dead. the boy ends up being the son of this man., who is kinda rich i think. \n\nIt is obvious throughout the show that the character have feelings they are trying to hide.  It is revealed that he was more than a friend to the mother. Later we find out she is his daughter, the son gets really angry and starts being mean to her. I think throughout this too there is a girl that likes the son. We find out after this that the boy is not the fathers son. At some point he runs away and people try to find him. She is able to find him in a house, alone i dont know if it is his house or hers but she finds him there.  he kisses her and i think he might have done more but i am unsure. i think people find them in the house and am unsure if they know what went on between them but they can sense his weird attachment to her. A bit after this, idk what happens, but he ends up going abroad to study college, and she later follows him on a scholarship with other people. I think the  girl who likes him followed him there too. She ends up touring and is in a market i think and they see each other and he drags her away. for the rest of the show they get to know each other and i think towards the end they kiss by a walkway with the city in the background but am not too sure. \n\n  \nPlease help me find it!!!",

    "content": "Hi everyone! We’re part of the Bugaboo TV team and wanted to share a spoiler-free review of a gripping Thai melodrama that blends romance, revenge, and emotional twists: **SADDEN-CHAINS (โซ่เวรี)**. This isn’t a promotional post—just an honest recommendation for anyone looking for intense Thai dramas with English subtitles that delve into the messy depths of love and betrayal.\n\n**Synopsis ⛓️**\n\nWhen destiny weaves two people together with chains of resentment, the result is explosive. *SADDEN-CHAINS* follows the story of Irin, a woman whose life is shattered by a misunderstanding and a cruel twist of fate, and Karn, the man whose love for her is buried under years of bitterness and mistrust. Bound by past wounds and family entanglements, they find themselves pulled into a dangerous dance of passion, revenge, and redemption. Every step forward threatens to break them apart—or draw them closer to an inevitable truth.\n\n**Why It’s Worth Watching**\n\n* **Explosive Emotional Chemistry** : The push-and-pull between Irin and Karn is electric—every argument and stolen glance adds fuel to the fire.\n* **Layered Revenge Plot** : More than just romance, the series explores the consequences of misunderstandings, vengeance, and the cost of pride.\n* **Cinematic Production &amp; Performances** : Beautiful cinematography and powerful performances make the emotions hit hard, especially in pivotal confrontations.\n\n**Considerations**\n\n* **High Drama &amp; Emotional Intensity** : Expect shouting matches, tears, and emotional rollercoasters. It’s unapologetically melodramatic.\n* **Twists &amp; Misunderstandings** : The plot thrives on tension, so if you dislike long-running conflicts, this might test your patience.\n\n**Availability**\n\n*SADDEN-CHAINS (โซ่เวรี)* aired on Channel 7 HD in 2021 and is available for streaming—English subtitles included—on Bugaboo TV Premium.\n\n**Let’s Discuss!**\n\nIf you enjoy love stories forged in pain, with characters chained together by fate and pride, *SADDEN-CHAINS* is worth the watch. Have you seen it—what did you think of Irin and Karn’s fiery relationship? Can love survive when built on a foundation of betrayal? Share your thoughts—we’d love to hear them!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n— Bugaboo TV Team ",

    "content": "I've been thinking about it for a while, the way the structure of the 1st episode of a drama means a lot...\n\nI usually like dramas that let us see who the main leads are 1st. That means things like showing their family, family dynamics, friends or hobby they are into during the 1st few minutes of the 1st episode. It makes it easier to get into the drama and what might happen in the future.\n\nIt's a bit frustrating when the episodes starts all of a sudden and we don't really know about the main leads. Sometimes I see dramas where they already jump into the plot, for example: 1 student ends up in the main leads class but we don't know why they transferred or from where they came from...\n\nTell me what you think.",

I then moved on to When I Fly Towards You. This was before The First Frost came out and I was excited to watch it!! I started with C-Dramas. I started Amidst a Snowstorm of Love after that, but quickly got bored so I stopped it. \n\nAfter I dropped that one, I picked up my first two K-Dramas, which were Flower of Evil and Lovely Runner. After those, I have been stuck on K-Dramas. \n\nWhen The First Frost came out, I initially tried to watch it, but I’ve found it hard ever since I deep dived into K-Dramas to be able to function trying to watch any other Asian dramas. I couldn’t watch Alice in Borderland either. \n\nI’m not sure if it’s the language switch up that throws my brain off since I’m so used to - and have learned quite a bit of Korean or if there’s something different explaining it.\n\nIf anyone’s been through this or know any tips and tricks to help, please please let me know! I want to watch The First Frost so bad, but I just cannot function properly. I couldn’t even rewatch Hidden Love and that was THE drama that got me into dramas. ",

I don't mind watching it elsewhere if it's on a different platform.\n\nSummary: The FL gets broken up with, and the boyfriend starts dating a snobby, rich girl who bullies the FL. The FL ends up having a one-night stand with a man. We soon find out that this man is the rich dad of the female bully, and the FL ended up pregnant (typical lol) from the one-night stand. The FL ends up marrying the CEO/rich dad.\n\nAnyway, it ended with the female bully finding out that she wasn't the bio daughter of the rich CEO dad, and he disowns her.\n\nExtra Details: FL grew up poor and has a horrible mom. The Female bully and ex-boyfriend got married to each other, with the FL and new hubby attending their wedding, so the FL was there in the position of step-mom of the Female bully. I believe the FL and ex-boyfriend grew up around each other.\n\nThese dramas are my dumb guilty pleasures while I work. I know they get taken down for copyright purposes.

    "content": "Hi everyone! We’re part of the Bugaboo TV team and wanted to share a spoiler‑free review of a compelling Thai drama that blends intense action, moral dilemmas, and emotional resonance: **Outlaw Justice (หุบพญาเสือ)**. This isn’t a promotional post—just a heartfelt recommendation for fans of Thai dramas with English subtitles who are drawn to tales of vigilante justice set against rural backdrops.\n\n**Synopsis 🦁** \n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, Thailand is still struggling under poverty and corruption. The wealthy wield power beyond the law, while the common folk suffer. Enter **Suea Pir**—a revered outlaw known for defending the oppressed in the remote jungle of Huobpa Ya Suea. When **Phan**, a man scarred by tragedy and physical injury, meets **Phailin**, the daughter of a local official, he realizes his life is intertwined with Suea Pir’s legend. As Phan becomes entangled with the outlaw’s cause, the line between law and justice blurs, leading to a gripping journey of sacrifice, identity, and social upheaval.  \n\n**Why It’s Worth Watching**\n\n* **Steadfast Heroism &amp; Moral Complexity :** Suea Pir isn’t just a bandit—he’s a symbol of hope for the oppressed. The tension between lawful authority and righteous conduct lies at the heart of the drama.\n* **Character-Driven Relationships :** Phan’s devotion to Phailin, and his internal struggle with self-worth, adds depth and emotional grounding to the narrative. Their bond anchors the broader rebel arc.  \n* **Historical Context &amp; Social Commentary :** Drawing from post‑WWII realities—scarcity, power imbalance, and rural injustice—the series gives viewers a glimpse into Thailand’s fraught historical period.  \n\n**Considerations**\n\n* **Violence &amp; Moral Ambiguity :** Expect intense action, confrontations, and sometimes brutal justice. The drama doesn’t shy away from the cost of rebellion.\n* **Slow Burn &amp; Ensemble Cast :** At 18 episodes, the pacing builds gradually—rewarding those who stay invested. It’s less about fast-paced thrills and more about emotional payoff.  \n\n**Availability**\n\n*Outlaw Justice (หุบพญาเสือ)* aired on **Channel 7 HD in 2022** and is now available for streaming—English subtitles included—on Bugaboo TV Premium. We’re proud to deliver high-quality Thai dramas that bring cultural stories to a global audience.  \n\n**Let’s Discuss!**\n\nIf you appreciate narratives about justice outside the law, emotional sacrifice, and strong moral convictions, *Outlaw Justice* should definitely be on your radar. Have you seen it—what did you think of Suea Pir as a hero? Know another Thai drama exploring redemption or social justice? Drop your thoughts below—we’d love to connect!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n— *Bugaboo TV Team* ",

    "content": "Hello dear ones,\nplease help me find an Asian series. Maybe KDRAMA. Unfortunately, I don't know much more. But it just won't let me go. It must have been in the 2017-2019 timeframe when I watched it (maybe is more 2019), so it can't be any younger. Probably about Viki! In my memory it's set in a school. It's about a main protagonist who has her friends there with whom she also lives together in a room. And then there's the love interest. He's a bit older than her and I don't think he's a normal student. More like an assistant to a teacher/professor there? Perhaps even in the scientific field (very uncertain information).  In any case, they fall in love and even get together sometimes. He was always really mean, too. But when they're together, he's just absolutely sweet with her. I think they even secretly went away somewhere together for the weekend on vacation. Or did she stay with him for a while? I can't remember, but I think they definitely split up again because she got to know his bad side. There was something there. He may have been drinking and then got really angry? And I think she draws or paints. I'm not sure anymore. And she also meets someone else at the same time who's been in love with her for a while, a pupil there at the school at her age. Maybe there was something at the beginning with a fire alarm where they met? (Or it's a false memory) And I don't even know if they get together in between.  I'm not sure about that. But I think so, because it's always such a back and forth. But, as I said, I'm no longer one hundred percent sure. I just know that the end is also something, that she submits something. Maybe something like a self-made children's book or something, definitely something from her as an art project. Either she painted, drew and then turned it into a children's book or she wrote something, stories. I'm not sure anymore. They should be submitted somehow. And all I know is that at the end, they weren't sure who she really got together with.And I just know that in the end all the girls she was friends with and she are sitting at a table, that's a few years later. They're talking about their lives now in a more grown-up way and she says, I think it rings a bell. And then she's like, oh, my fiancé. She's the only one who's already engaged, but they're all still quite young. Either she's engaged or she's already married. I'm not sure about that either. Then she says, oh, my fiancé or husband is coming. And you're really in suspense. Okay, who is it now? And then she opens the door and it's actually the one she was always so in love with. And you're just really happy. \n\nHope any of you recognize this and can help me find the series! Thx ;)",

Like I remember that despite never watching bl I was really intrigued by it but yeah I can't find it now because I don't remember the title. So basically this drama was about these two best friends if not childhood best friends if I recall correctly that was set in a highschool and I'm pretty sure it was already said from the beggining that one of the best friends was inlove with the other and  this thing had a whole fan base like there were edits on TikTok if you searched it up. And like in those edits there was this one scene with was often put where one of the leads stares at the other when he isn't looking I think? MAN IDK but I think it was revealed later that the other best friend actually liked the other all along. Anyways I know this is really vague but if you can think of any drama like this please let me know ",

If anyone remembers this show or has any guesses, I would really appreciate your help!",

    "content": "Hi everyone!  \nOne of the dramas I watched recently and found surprisingly emotional was **Hidden Love (2023)**.  \nAt first, I thought it would just be another noona-romance, but it turned out to be something more layered.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was how soft and unspoken the love between the leads felt—never forced, but always present.  \nThe female lead’s quiet nature and emotional hesitation mixed beautifully with the male lead’s patient, sincere warmth.\n\nThere’s something very touching about watching a love that slowly grows without shouting it from the rooftops.\n\nI wrote a spoiler-free blog post about the show, focusing on the tone, characters, and storytelling.  \nIf anyone wants to read and share their take, here it is:\n\n🔗 *Read here:*  \n👉 [blogadresimbuzlar.blogspot.com/2023/09/hidden-love-2023.html](https://blogadresimbuzlar.blogspot.com/2023/09/hidden-love-2023.html)\n\n👀 For those who’ve seen it:\n\n* Did the age gap dynamic work for you?\n* Did you feel the emotional tension even though it was subtle?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! 💬",

I was a kid back then, so I don’t remember the language, but I’m sure it was posted on an official YouTube channel, not fansub.\n\nHere’s what I remember:\n\t•\tIt took place in high school, but the school had a very old/retro vibe — wooden desks, old-fashioned classrooms, kind of a vintage style.\n\t•\tThe female lead wasn’t snobbish, she was just completely uninterested in the popular/rich male lead.\n\t•\tIt was a romantic comedy, with a light and youthful tone.\n\t•\tI vaguely remember the episodes being around 40–60 minutes, but I’m not 100% sure.\n\t•\tThere may have been a subplot in another drama I watched around the same time where a friend gets shot and ends up working in the same company as the others — but this might not be part of the same show.\n\nI’ve been searching for years and nothing matches exactly. I’m starting to think it was a lesser-known webdrama or mini-series, probably released by a local production company or school project.\n\nIf any of this sounds even a little familiar, please let me know — I would be so grateful! 🙏",

The Male lead is a Rich guy who has a grandfather, aunt, and i believe an uncle. The grandson, aunt (her husband), and ( i think there was an uncle ) all try being really good to the grandfather to end up getting his inheritance because he was loaded and I think he was sick. Later on, it turns out that the Grandfather and the poor female lead’s grandmother were in love when they were younger. Grandfather ends up finding out that the female lead and her younger brother are related to her and he eventually ends up bringing them to live with him and take care of them, after finding out about the grandmother’s death. I also remember something about the female lead being into plants or like herbs or something. Main male lead was obvi cocky, self-centered, etc. I also remember there was a love triangle with the main leads and this other “ bad boy “ male, he drove a motorcycle and had like an orange/brown mullet. \nThis is mostly what I remember, if ANYONE knows even the slightest idea of what i’m talking about PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

The woman wants her daughter to come back and live with her, but the kid does not want to . The love interest is the CEO of a fried chicken restaurant chain. The second love interest was someone from the woman's life before the military. Spring was in the name of the title but I can't remember anything else. The show centered on her normal life back in the population and didn't include war scenes. Can you please help me find this show? or direct me to places to look. I don't know what language it was in.

I’ve searched a lot but haven’t found a match yet. It feels like a classic “ugly duckling” fairy tale but with a unique flower/cocoon and miniature realm twist.\n\nThanks so much in advance!\n\n",

I know that it's pretty common to get local remakes of foreign dramas so I was interested to see what Chinese creators could do with a similar story. \n\nI'm 1.5 episodes in and it's feeling a cheap remake with no thought. Perhaps the budget wasn't as big but where MMH and PMR were well filmed and heart-wrenching, Her Trajectory (listed as Her Trajection on MDL) feels like a Wattpad recap of MMH. I get that it can be hard to create tension in a mini drama but everything feels so forced. I'm about ready to switch this off and go back to MMH. Maybe the slight differences in premise will lead to bigger changes later in the season but right now I just don't want to waste my time.\n\nDid anyone else feel the same?",

It only had English subtitles — no Portuguese or other language options were available at the time.\n\nHere’s everything I remember:\n\nIt was a comedy drama in Mandarin, with multiple episodes (so not a movie).\n\nThe opening scene showed the male and female leads running away from their mothers, who were chasing them — possibly trying to hit them.\n\nThey collide at a curve, and when they do, a red half-moon-shaped stone falls on the ground. I think it symbolizes a connection between them.\n\nThe male lead calls the woman \"Mrs. Cheater\" because he caught her in bed with someone).\n\nIf I'm right, the woman have a house nearby a lot of trees, so she lives more in a countryside.",

Our protagonist saved him from an arrow (unintentionally). In addition to the 2nd prince, the 5th prince also takes care of her (initially she refused to marry him but later realized that he is the one who truly loved her). The \"good\" protagonist tries to make her look bad several times, but the 5th prince is always there to support her, but to prevent her from betraying him, he makes her eat a worm (one of those that if something happens to one the other feels). In the end, the 2nd prince realizes that the good protagonist is always complaining and falls in love with the villain, but she does not accept him because she stays with the 5th. That's what I remember, hopefully someone out there has the information. Thanks!",

And he told her that he was a detective and she asked him if he could find somebody for her aka her mom I think and so they meet up and her mom turns out to be mean and she chose that life without her and her dad and so she went out and he was waiting for her and they got on the motorcycle together and btw her dad is a horrible person who just so happens that (guy with white hair) lives with him and says that he's nice but he's not (the girl lives with another person idk him) \n\nPLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS DRAMA ",

    "content": "A Virtuous Business is a remake of a British TV show from 2016 called Brief Encounters, by Oriane Messina and Fay Rusling. The South-Korean version was written by Choi Bo-rim, directed by Jo Woong, and starred by Kim So-yeon, Yeon Woo-jin, Kim Sung-ryung, Kim Sun-young, and Lee Se-hee.\n\nSet in 1992, in the rural Geumje village, this show follows the story of four women who decide to sell sex toys to their neighbors - sometimes in casual get-togethers, sometimes by knocking door to door. Each one of them has their particular reason to get involved in such a controversial business, even more in the 90s.\n\nWith time, these women become real friends, and, together, dream about becoming financially independent.",

Here's what I remember:\n\nThe story centers around a woman who is married to an abusive husband.\n\nWhenever he gets angry or abusive, he takes her down to a basement or underground room, turns up the volume on Beethoven music, and abuses her so that their children and his mother won’t hear it.\n\nHe uses a red object (maybe a belt or stick?) to beat her.\n\nThere’s a scene where she says something like: “I hate Beethoven. It reminds me of…” (referring to the abuse i cant remember what she say exactly).\n\nOne day, the woman gets into an accident, and after that she loses her memory and forgets her husband and the abuse.\n\nThere’s another man who helps or protects her as she tries to recover.\n\nThere’s also a very creepy part: The husband has a hidden room behind a bookshelf — kind of like a secret control room with a TV and monitors where he can watch surveillance footage of the whole house. He spies on her every move.\n\nI think it might have been inspired by the American movie Sleeping with the Enemy.\n\n \n\nIf anyone recognizes this \n\nplease help please! 🙏",

He didn't cheat. He didn't lead anyone on. He wasn't in love and ended it. Like anyone else would have done. But she says some crap about how her mom endured her marriage for 14 years for her and left her dad heartbroken like it's even close to the same thing. When really if  her mom would have left when she realized she was unhappy shewoildnt have wasted 14 years of both of their lives. And the fact that she just dropped him after everything he had done for her all because his ex shows it clearly looking for trouble really pisses me off. She didn't even let him explain he had to track her down and make her listen. And I know she has trust issues but he has been open and honest to her about everything (expect his death, be he's warned her enough she should have pieced it together already) and it's really making her seem childish. \n\nDid this bug anyone else as much as it has me??",

He has a niece (D) that he dotes on.  \n\n\nSister meets young guy(B) who keeps hitting on her, which she likes but tries not to as socially unacceptable. Young guy I think she sees on the stairs of the university for the first time? One scene he does ballroom dancing club. He has a girl chasing him of the same age. He confesses his love at a masquerade ball and sister runs away. at one point sister is in young guys apartment and his friends show up so she acts as a maid.  \n\n\nBrother has a girl (d) student who at first tries to play pranks and doesn't like him. She somehow ends up hiding in his car and going home with him. he tries to hide her in his apartment. eventually they end up dating.  \n\n\nThe siblings try to hide all of this from their parents, who also try to get daughter and E together and try to split up son C and girl D (due to age differences)  There are also many neighbors who keep the parents in the loop of who they see who with.  Also I think the dad starts getting dementia and family has to go search for him in the park.  Also, I feel there is a missing dog or cat at some point that the sister finds and puts up posters for.",

    "title": "Getting back into it",
    "content": "Hi eveyrone, hope all is well! As the title suggests, I haven't been in the loop at all with dramas for quite a few years now and really want to get back into it.\n\nI'm currently in the mood for something trashy, toxic and morally ambiguous. Below are a few dramas that I've watched and some thoughts on it. (Buckle up, some of the stuff that I've got to say might be considered controversial lmao)\n\n1. Love between fairy and demon - I enjoyed the concept of it but it was honestly a bit cartoonish (and the FML spoke in this weird tone which made it so annoying). This would have been an all time favourite if it were more mature and dark.\n2. Better days - this one WRECKED me. I'm just not in the mood for them kids man. Although their love for each other wasn't toxic, I really enjoyed the \"us against the world\" vibe that it had with the absolutely shitty circumstances they found themselves in.\n3. HIStory3: Trapped - Honestly can't remember wtf happened in this one, I just know that I gave it a 10 on MDL and the picture is the one guy pointing a gun to the love interest. Sold.\n4. Midnight - Ok so remember when I told you that I might say some controversial stuff... I whish they kissed I'M SORRY I SAID IT. Like I mentioned, I want some toxic stuff alright (obvi I don't condone this irl)\n5. My name - LOVED the story just wish there were a teensy little bit romance in here\n6. Doom at your service - one of my all time favourites but make it more macabre\n7. My liberation notes - I feel like a broken record; give me more romance and I can die happy\n8. Flower of evil - this is a very popular rec. I've watched it :) (honestly can't remember anything)\n9. Tempted (I think also known as The Great Seducer or smth) - once again, controversial opinion: it was trash but it was so good. Truly a dumpster fire that warmed my heart &lt;3. If you can rec me a Tempted 2.0, I WILL do a backflip\n\n(y'all are gonna hate me for this one)  \n10. Nevertheless, - once again, I ATE that toxic shit UP (still, justice for potato boy). Same as the previous one, I will do a backflip if you rec me a Nevertheless 2.0\n\n11. Somebody - ...what can I say, I have a soft spot for toxic dumpster fires.\n\n12. A man and a woman - do I have to even explain???\n\n13. Real 2017 - now I admit, this one was just bad. If they added any sort of actual storyline with this one and not just random shock-value shenanigans, I might have actually enjoyed it. I like the premise of the story (from what I can remember) just could do without the very confusing ending\n\n14. KinnPorsche - now I know previously I said that I will do backflips (obvi lies, I don't have an athletic bone in my body) I will, however, ACTUALLY do a backflip if you can rec me something EXACTLY like this. This was so good on all levels pleeaasseee, I will never peak in life again as I have when I watched this series.\n\n15. The smile has left your eyes - really enjoyed it, was a bit disappointed at the end when the guy had a redemption arc and became 'good'\n\nSome general notes:  \n\\-please try to keep it romance as much as possible  \n\\-I don't mind if the couple is straight or gay, as long as it's good  \n\\-I'm not super in the mood for any 'coming of age' type of stuff  \n\\-I'm an adult, please don't recommend me something with them fuckass kids &lt;3",

Later they locates to either China or Taiwan. This part could although be a confusion with another show, so no need to include this fact, hence why it is in parenthesis.)\n\nThese are some stuff I remember. I will add more if I remember. \n\nHelp a sister out! Thanks in advance!",

    "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nJust watched this series again and it still really pissed me off. The ending just sends such a bad message. She goes back to an abusive, cheating spouse, dumping the loving, supportive man who cherishes her. Then, she divorces the spouse, opens her own salon, and - for some unknown reason - still stays away from the goldfish guy?!?! Why?! \n\nI know that some people will say it’s a sort of positive, feminist ending. She’s on her own, living her own life, not needing any man. I think it’s great that she’s become strong and independent, but that doesn’t mean she needs eschew any kind of relationship, especially with a man who supports her independence and encourages her to be her own person. They belong together. It’s just a confusing, weak ending. \n\nThe worst part is, at the very end they set up a scenario where they’re both gonna meet at the beach for the fireworks and then they pull the rug out from under you and the screen just goes black. If this was some kind of serious, poignant and innovative drama, I could handle the ending, but this is Fishbowl Wives! It’s one step above your basic softcore, lascivious stuff like Red Shoes Diaries. You watch this kind of stuff for the HEA, not for it to circumvent expectations with some kind of open-ended, pseudo-feminist-manifesto ending. All the other vignettes are tied up with a tidy bow, and they’re fairly corny, and the one that you really care about, the central story, has to have some kind of confusing, unsatisfying ending. Just… dumb. ",

    "content": "I've watched a few dramas where there is a male protagonist and a male antagonist and there's a lot of tension between them. Lots of eye contact, obsessed with each other, hyper focused on their rivalry, etc. Off the top of my head Evilive, Devil Judge, and Weak Class Hero are a few examples that come to mind. I like the build up of conflict between the two characters over the course of the drama, especially when they're obsessed with each other and seemingly drawn to each other. I also like when the male protagonist is evil, but charming/handsome enough to be forgiven by the audience (me) or so cunning and ruthless that you start rooting for them. I haven't seen one of these types of dramas with a female lead though so I was wondering if anyone else had and could recommend one. Hope this isn't weird. Thank you for reading!",

    "content": "Hi everyone! We’re part of the **Bugaboo TV** team and wanted to share a **review** of a compelling Thai drama we recently subtitled:\n\n**Twist of Fate (ในรอยทราย)**, a 2024 crime-romance series from Channel 7.\n\n**What It’s About?**\n\nThe drama follows twin brothers—**Tiwa**, a dedicated police officer, and **Tawan**, a playboy businessman—who are forced to exchange lives when Tawan suffers amnesia after a violent incident. Tiwa impersonates Tawan to expose a trafficking ring, while Tawan gradually recovers and gets drawn into Tiwa’s world of duty, love, and moral conflict. Meanwhile, **Wimala (“Wi”)**, a longtime love interest of Tiwa, must navigate her feelings as she encounters Tawan in Tiwa’s life.\n\n**What Makes It Worth Watching?**\n\n* **Dual-role intrigue**: Mike Pattaradej gives layered performances as both Tiwa and Tawan.\n* **Emotional complexity**: The brothers’ identity swap creates deep questions of morality, loyalty, and self-discovery.\n* **Blend of genres**: Action-packed plot around crime and trafficking mixed with romantic tension—especially in the love triangle with Wi.\n* **Cinematic setting**: Scenes along the Mekong and in corporate spaces provide sharp visual contrast and atmosphere.\n\n**Heads-Up**\n\n* It’s a **34 episode** series, so pacing is steady rather than fast.\n* The “identity swap” trope is central; there’s drama, tension, and ethical ambiguities tied to that twist.\n\n**Subtitles &amp; Access**\n\nTwist of Fate now has complete English subtitles, available exclusively on Bugaboo TV Premium. We’ve recently expanded our subtitled catalog to include over 10 Thai dramas, and we’re working to bring more titles—across romance, action, and mystery—to international viewers.\n\nIf you’re into dual-identity plots, moral dilemmas, and layered brother-sister dynamics, Twist of Fate is worth adding to your watchlist.\n\nWe’d love to hear what you think—whether you’ve seen it or are planning to start. Happy to answer questions or hear your Thai drama recs below!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n— Bugaboo TV Team",

I will give the plot points which I remember. \n\n1.  The protagonist will enter a village and starts the role of detective/ police officer. He fights bad guys in a power suit like power rangers. His senior/ coworker will also be fighting against the bad guys in power suit.\n\n2. there will be a woman ghost in the station which usually talks with the protagonist and went peace and left the station in the later part of the series.\n\n3. there will be an event saying which form of martial arts is the most successful one and a woman who works with the protagonist in the station will win as she will be using peace as her choice like cutting the flowers because the opponents will not initiate attack without her initiating it. In the middle of the event, everyone in the event attack the bad guys infiltrated the building saying the protagonist superhero does not work properly. The protagonist would be stuck in mascot suit the whole episode.\n\n4.  In One of the episode, he will be jumped onto a rocket and came back from space. I faintly remember there will be a girl he needed to save.\n\nIt was a comedy drama series. Sorry that my points may not be clear. I really want to watch the series again because I got really connected. The problem is that it was not aired with the original title. I may forgot the title also. Similarly, I need to find the name of many series. I found and cherished the high kick through the roof series. Please help me in finding the drama name.\n\n",

But I wanna hear which dramas had y'all heated, up in arms, ready to die on a hill that the MC should have chosen 2nd LI.\n\nRight now, I'm watching Beauty of Resilience, and at the part where Wei Zhi is looking at her previous life. I'm screaming. Wu Nan is literally the perfect man for her, and Wei Zhi being blind to it for a mid Chen Yue is driving me insane. If I were into men, I would have married him in a heartbeat. \n\nI haven't been this heated since Ashes of Blood. I was 100% rooting for Runyu. He may or may not have been a good match for Jinmi, but the fact that his family, especially his uncle, didn't even help him shoot his shot like they did for Xufeng when Jinmi didn't have a preference for either was infuriating. \n\nNote: I think I also need to add this as it should be obvious without saying, but just in case: I'm not saying any character owes anyone their feelings or romance. And I realize you can't always control who you fall in love with. I am saying, though, that in my opinion, the MCs' brains/hearts are doing them so dirty, and they are missing out on better partners (again, in my opinion). ",

    "content": "Hi again! We’re the team at **Bugaboo TV**, back with another review of one of our currently streaming Thai dramas:  **Eternal Love (เภตรานฤมิต)**.\n\nThis one’s a great pick if you like a mix of period fantasy, historical romance, and time-slip drama tropes. It’s beautifully shot and leans into classic lakorn storytelling, with a modern twist.\n\n**What It’s About ?**\n\nA modern-day screenwriter working on a historical drama mysteriously finds herself transported back in time—into the world of the story she’s writing. There, she inhabits the body of a noblewoman caught in a tangled web of power, family secrets, and a fated love she never saw coming.\n\nThink *Scarlet Heart Ryeo* or *Outlander*, but with a distinctly Thai historical backdrop and some strong feminist energy as the heroine takes control of her new reality.\n\n**What We Liked ?**\n\n* **Lead actress is a standout** – balancing strength, vulnerability, and wit in both timelines.\n* **Cinematic production** – period sets, costumes, and lighting all feel polished and immersive.\n* **Emotional arcs** – the romance is slow-build, intense, and full of tension.\n* **Meta-layer** – the fact that she’s a writer makes the time-travel setup extra clever.\n\n**What to Expect ?**\n\n* It’s a slow burn—don’t expect action every minute.\n* Traditional period drama tropes are strong (especially family hierarchy/politics).\n* If you’re new to Thai dramas, the pacing may feel different from K-dramas or C-dramas—but give it a couple of episodes.\n\n**Subtitles Note**\n\n*Eternal Love* now comes with **full English subtitles** on Bugaboo TV Premium We’ve recently expanded our subtitle library to include 10+ Thai dramas with proper English subs, and this series was one of the most requested.\n\nWe’re working to bring more period and fantasy dramas like this to international viewers with smoother accessibility. If you’re into time-travel romance, rich historical detail, and strong female leads, this might be the one to try.\n\nLet us know if you’ve seen it—or if there are other Thai historicals you think more people should know about.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n— Bugaboo TV Team",

    "content": "I’m a recent convert to Kdrama and have been watching for the last three months. It coincided with a sleep issue meaning I’m getting through 2/3 series a week. My husband has been watching for a few years and recommended a few to start me off. I tried his CDrama recommendation at the beginning, The Rational Life, but after 3 episodes, I dropped it. I found it boring. Since then I stuck to Kdrama until this past week when I devoured The First Frost and I’m wondering if there’s more CDrama like that. Especially as one CDrama is about equal to 2 or 3 Kdramas and I’m conscious I’m going to exhaust the Kdrama catalogue soon.\n\n1. Must be recent - most Kdrama productions pre-2018 haven’t dated well.\n\n2. This is my list so far of Asian drama https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/lifev9\n\n3. Other things I’ve dropped - Mr Plankton, When Life Gives You Tangerines, Divorced Insurance, Backstreet Rookie.\n\n4. Fan of a green flag ML\n\n5. Would prefer something that doesn’t include elementary/primary school, and ideally not high school either - I did start another CDrama where the characters were in primary school, the boy moved and something about going to the book shop. No idea what it was but I dropped it.\n\n6. I’ve got Netflix, Prime and Viki\n\n7. My top 5 at present are Melo Movie, Our Beloved Summer, ThirtyNine, Love Scout and 2521, but also a fan of more romantic less ‘slice of life’ like Potato Lab, Love Next Door, Something in the Rain, Her Private Life, Love in Contract, Business Proposal, Hospital Playlist, What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim, and hometown cha cha cha.\n\n8. Not going to lie, but a good-looking male lead helps.\n\n",

I have a very distinct memory of the man coming back to a work site like maybe a construction site and finding a woman he was either previously in a relationship with or was married to. She is upset at him definitely and he has to struggle to get her back. I could be wrong about it being Thai because since having that memory, I've watched a lot of lakorns and have been unable to find it. For a while, I thought it was My Husband in Law, but it doesn't have the right scene that I remember I believe. This has been taunting me for far too long, so any possibilites could be helpful. The one thing I am sure of is that it is a contemporary romance. Any thoughts?",

    "content": "I've searched google but haven't had any luck despite having some specifics of the show. I only watched a few episodes and I'm pretty sure it was on youtube but I can't remember for certain. There shouldn't be anything too spoiler-y in this since I only saw the beginning but beware just in case. \n\nI wanna say this isn't a very old drama but it should be complete and it's probably a K or C drama rather than a J drama but I can't swear to it. \n\nSo I remember the FL is part of a higher end family, maybe ministers or something but I don't think royalty. It's not a historical drama but also didn't feel like a modern drama either? Like there aren't cars that I remember but there was a handgun I wanna say. The FL has a half, illegitimate sister by her father who is treated kind of like a maid in the house. \n\nThe first episode I wanna say opens with the family being attacked and the FL's parents being killed, but she survives because a guy traps her in a room and ties her to a bed post. She thinks this guy is the one attacking the family if I remember correctly so she escapes the room and runs away. She had a previously arranged marriage with a guy from another family so she runs to his family for help after the attack only to find out her sister got to the house first and has assumed her identity as the legitimate daughter of the house. When she arrives her sister claims that the FL is the illegitimate daughter and she has some document she got from the father during the attack that makes the family side with her so the FL is beat for it but ultimately brought in.\n\nDetails after that are a little sparse since it was so long ago and I only watched a bit but I remember: the fiance being a bit two-faced, the guy who traps her in the room during the massacre is actually the fiance's uncle(and the ML i think) and she swears to kill him for what he did to her family, the sister threatens the FL to keep quite because no one will believe her, the uncle was only trying to protect her but wont tell her the truth because it keeps her safer if her attention is on him, and the sister at one point gets slapped by the fiance i think. That's about all I can remember. It feels like plenty to find it but I've had no luck..\n\nTLDR: drama where the FL's bastard half-sister steals her identity and fiance after their family is massacred and the FL only survives because her fiance's uncle is protecting her.

    "content": "Hi everyone! We’re part of the **Bugaboo TV** team and wanted to share a quick spoiler-free review of a Thai series that might be a hidden gem for fans of emotional, slower-paced fantasy romance:\n\n**Marvellous Love (ฤทัยบดี)**\n\nThis isn’t a promotional post—just a recommendation from the people who worked on bringing it to international audiences, now with full English subs.\n\n# What It’s About\n\nSet across past and present lifetimes, *Marvellous Love* tells the story of two souls destined to find each other again. The show blends traditional Thai spiritual beliefs with themes of karmic love, identity, and redemption. The female lead begins to sense a connection to a life she’s never lived—leading to a story filled with symbolism, memory, and quiet emotional power.\n\n**What Makes It Stand Out**\n\n* **Atmosphere** – Dreamlike, reflective, and visually stunning with nature, temples, and period detail.\n* **Performance** – The lead actress brings emotional depth to a role that spans identities and timelines.\n* **Thematic richness** – Love, karma, fate, and selfhood are explored with nuance.\n* **Tone** – Gentle, spiritual, and meditative—a very different pace from typical fast-cut dramas.\n\n# Heads Up\n\n* It’s a slow burn—definitely not for those seeking action or comedy.\n* Some cultural/spiritual symbolism may feel unfamiliar, but it’s handled with care.\n* The story leans more poetic than plot-driven.\n\n# Subtitles &amp; Access\n\nWe’ve added **full English subtitles** for *Marvellous Love*, as part of a broader effort to make more Thai dramas accessible globally. So far, we’ve subtitled over **10 titles** across different genres—from period romance to modern action and we’re adding more.\n\nIf you’re looking for a romantic drama that feels more like a spiritual journey than a traditional love story, this one might resonate. We’d love to hear your thoughts—whether you’ve seen it, are curious about it, or have other Thai dramas you’d recommend to fellow viewers.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n— Bugaboo TV Team",

The girl is perceived as homely. The guy is dealing with some sort of weird medical issue I think. The guy likes some other girl but throughout the film he starts to like the main girl. They graduate and go their separate ways. I think she goes to America or Europe. He thinks he’s going to visit her. When he gets there he meets the girl he liked before the main girl. The main girl is now an artist or a photographer or something and the other girl is now her roommate or assistant or something. At the end of the movie he learns that she was never going to meet with him because she had died before he ever got there. \n\nThat’s what I remember. If the beginning is off then maybe I’m mixed it up with another movie but the end ending is the movie I’m looking for. I remember the name being something nature themed like something garden or flower, idk. Please help 🙏",

    "content": "Hi everyone! Back again with another spoiler-free drama review of our newer dramas that takes a step away from romance and into grittier territory: Mekong\n\n**What It’s About**\n\nThe story centers on officers stationed along the Mekong River, navigating a complex web of cross-border smuggling, personal loyalties, and dangerous decisions. As tensions rise between duty and morality, characters are pushed to their limits. It’s not a light watch but it’s bold, grounded, and quite cinematic in tone.\n\n**Why It Stands Out**\n\nAtmosphere – Shot on location near the actual Mekong, it feels authentic and lived-in.\n\nGritty storytelling – Doesn’t shy away from gray areas or uncomfortable choices.\n\nSolid cast – The lead roles have quiet intensity, with emotional weight behind the action.\n\nSound design &amp; pacing – It builds tension slowly, then hits hard when needed.\n\n# Heads Up\n\n* The tone is serious—there’s little levity here.\n* Dialogue leans realistic and unflashy (which fits, but may feel slow at first).\n* Less traditional “drama structure”—more like a streaming thriller.\n\n**Subtitles Note**\n\nWe’ve added full English subtitles for Mekong as part of our growing subbed catalog on Bugaboo TV (now 10+ dramas and counting). We’re working to make more diverse Thai genres beyond just romance—available for international viewers. If you’ve seen Mekong, we’d love to hear your thoughts or if you’re just starting it, let us know how it lands. Also open to questions about the series or subtitled titles in general.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\n\\- BUGABOO TV Team",

Also, this may be a second couple trope, and the reel may have been cut to fit this scenario. I don't know.\n\nMan goes into the hotel room 906. Woman misreads her room number. Instead of room 609, she goes into 906. They both seem drunk and have a one night stand. Nice and gentle kissing and crossing of fingers. Looks warm. Later guy finds woman at her workplace, it looks like. He is not sure if she remembers him. From the reel it looks like maybe they have some time getting to know each other and it looks like he really likes her. She is found out though, and she is threatened with termination, because it's included in her contract that an employee or manager cannot have a personal relationship with a client. She is also slapped across her face by a woman who may be her boss because of it.\n\nThere is also a scene where he and a woman (maybe the slapping lady) are sitting at a bar, she pulls him in and kisses him while FL or SFL looks on, looking sad or hurt. \n\nThe man reminded me of the 2nd ML in My Dearest Nemesis, but it's not him and it's not their story either.\n\nAdded the insta reel.

Just 2 things to remember, the male lead should be some capable smart person, and avoid the slice-of-life or rom-com genre since I watched most of them.\n\n\n\nSome that meet the example, and I really like:\n\n\n\nStranger S1 + S2 - Basically this is the show which made me post this.\n\n\n\nHot Stove League - Excellent drama, Easily top 10 kdramas ever\n\n\n\nLaw School - Great show with cool characters and acting\n\n\n\nD.P - Another great show\n\n\n\nExtracurricular - Probably one of the rare \" genre \" kdramas where they stick to the genre. It was great. \n\n\n\nKairos &amp; Kingdom - Both of them are great but both had some over-the-top actings though not enough to ruin the show. \n\n\n\nP.S - My Mister, Liberation notes, Our beloved summer, One spring Nights all of them fall under realistic and nuanced acting but as I said I want dramas where the male lead has a significant role.

I love romance and costal vibes. My favorite kdrama is lovely runner so maybe that’ll give you an idea of what I like. I recently watched Swing Girls and Call Me Chihiro. Which I really enjoyed even though they aren’t romance based. I liked how raw and interesting they were. I was recommended Lion no Kakurega, is that a good series to watch? I started episode one in my Japanese class haha. I’m hoping to find series or movies that are interesting and captivating. Please send me your best recommendations! \n\nJdramas I’ve already watched: \n- good morning call\n- Alice in borderland \n- eye love you (I got tired of the main girls acting) \n- itsuka, nemuri ni tsuku hi\n- daytime shooting star (one of my favorites)\n- switched \n- blue spring ride\n- one week friends ",

    "content": "My first K-drama was called “All of Us Are Dead”.\nIt told the story of how a student was bitten by a hamster, and the biology teacher noticed it. He grabbed her and injected her with an antidote.\n(An antidote is a substance that counteracts poison.)\nThere were rumors at school that the teacher’s son had gone missing and that he was bullied. One of the girls was also bullied, and she used to hang out with the group who bullied her.\nSome time passed, and then Hyun-Ju appeared (that’s the only name I remember from the drama). She was covered in blood, being carried by a classmate, and followed by others. They brought her to the nurse’s office. Other classes saw this and wondered what had happened.\nAt the nurse’s office, she was placed on a bed. Her body temperature was low, but she felt hot. Suddenly, Hyun-Ju bit the nurse’s hand, leaving a wound. They called an ambulance, and she was taken away.\nLater, the teachers were discussing what happened. One of them said the rumors were already spreading, and asked why phones hadn’t been collected. The response was that they needed to focus on figuring out the situation.\nI'm still thinking about this drama — it was intense!\nWhat was your first K-drama? 😊\n",

The last thing I remember is the last episode the 3 of them are sitting at a table talking about what would’ve happened if they all didn’t end up with their partners. Please if you know it let me know, I’ve been looking for it for years, I watched it all on YouTube if that helps. 😪😪",

Mountains i think. \n\nI think this was more fantasy? I never watch fantasy stuff so thats probably why I cannot find it.

I’ve been searching everywhere with no luck, so I’d really appreciate any help!\n\nHere’s what I remember:\n\t•\tIt was a realistic, crime-focused Japanese drama, set in or around a high school.\n\n\t•\tThe plot involved high school students, and touched on drug dealing, a mafia boss, and general criminal activity.\n\n\t•\tThere was a male-female police duo investigating the events.\n\n\t•\tThe characters all used modern smartphones (Android/iPhone), not flip phones, so it’s definitely a modern setting.\n\t•\tThere was a school beach trip episode.\n\n\t•\tOne memorable scene involved a female student dressed as Wonder Woman, and a male character saves her.\n\n\t•\tOne male character wore a handmade necklace made from a broken green handle of a cup — the cup had been used in a fight earlier.\n\nThe show was on Netflix, and I’m almost certain the title was in Japanese or Korean(not English).\n\nIf this rings a bell for anyone, please let me know! This show has been stuck in my head and I’d love to revisit it.",
