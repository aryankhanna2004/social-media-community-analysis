    "title": "Kairat - Love story or grooming?",
    "content": "This will offend all the Kaira/Kairat fans but it needs to be said. Kartik was literally so in love with Naira, but even before their second separation, he started to display all his toxic traits, one of them being CONTROL. His love began to fade and the character did not feel the same as before. He started getting jealous of Naira about things as simple as a mango eating competition when she said that she was better than him, as a joke, but he was put off. Next, man was PISSED that Naira won an award when he anticipated it for himself. \n\nWhen the Puru mama track had just started, he even asks Naira if she will be mad that he would get busy with a project he took up and she says, \"Voh pyaar hi kya jo apnon ko aage badhte na dekh sake\" Because that's what a good partner does. I'm not saying she was the best, but she takes the cake when it comes to loyalty and love. Then, he proceeded to assassinate her character when that Mihir Kapoor track came, all because she walked out of the same room as him. He basically called her disloyal and unfaithful just because she was starting to become financially more capable and independent, hence he could no longer control her. Being jealous of your own partner and being a typical chauvinist when they become better than you is a trait of a control obsessed partner. \n\nSuhasini was so right about him when she said ki mard aurat ki kaamyaabi nahi dekh sakta or something along the lines of that. The only reason he supported her in those dance competitions was because she wasn't competing in his league. Had he been a dancer, he would throw a fit about this too. I'm not saying that Naira did the right thing by committing paternity fraud or her bhagodi tag is invalid, but imagine the scar it would leave on your mind if the father of your baby called it somebody else's, just because you work with a man??? \n\nAnd the result?? After they remarried, Naira never thought of becoming independent again and was always shown as a homemaker with a few scenes of her giving ideas in the Goenka family business to whitewash Kartik's image of a mysoginist. Whether or not she was lazy enough to never work again is a completely different case, we're only talking about Kartik here. \n\nEach time they separated, Kartik wanted to remarry. First Vedika, then Gayu and then Sirat. You can't tell me that dadi forced him or that it was for the kids. He didn't marry Ashi even when Swarna wanted him to, because Naira, his back up option was alive lol. If you notice the pattern here, Vedika was his responsibility, wanted to accept the Goenkas as her family and was the perfect candidate to do \"Ji Kartik\" Then he cheated on her and started an affair with Naira because yayy.. Back up option was back, and acted like she was crazy to be mad at him like bro you literally married her 🙄\n\nGayu, someone who already never had a stable life. Found out that her biological dad was a cheater, saw her mom remarry, then the stepdad and mom died, likes Kartik, has to give him up. Likes Vivaan, he dies too. Then marries Samarth, he turns out to be toxic too and then he just abandoned her. She was already vulnerable by all of this, which also makes her the perfect candidate to control + be nanny for his kids. Suhasini is also to blame. Damn, the Goenka genes go strong here. \n\nI established control up until this point because that's a classic characteristic of a groomer. Kartik has to be at least in his mid thirties when Naira died with all the leaps they took. Naira this, Naira that, meri Naira.. All the Naira jaap faded within MONTHS of her death. She had several flaws but never even looked at another man and only loved him till she died but what did he do? Married her doppelgänger, made her the nanny of his kids and moved on with her in less than a year of her dying. Why? Because a 21 y/o would be much easier to control than Naira, who was of a similar age. Sirat was perfect because brownie points - She had no family and was just aquitted of murder. He acted as a supportive husband for Sirat but impregnated her on the very first night of their wedding, even though her career had just started. Yes, it takes two to tango but I don't think a 21 year old is mature enough to take such big decisions, especially when the Goenkas had already established her as Kairav and Akshu's mother. His acting of supporting her boxing career and telling her not to be like Naira was all fake, because if he really was such a green flag, he would ask her not to have an additional responsibility of Aarohi and hit pause at her career that had just begun. \n\nNot to forget, Sirat was shown as a homemaker before the Gen 3 leap, so again, the woman stayed at home to take of the kids. Manish, too gave a lot of shit to Sirat, used to hate her and question her khoon khaandaan all the time, but he never stood up to him even once. Kartik only wanted a housewife, not an equal, a competant girl who could be better than him. Preying on a young, ambitious girl who is more than a decade younger and getting her pregnant on the first night, moving on with her within months of your doppelgänger's death means that he just used Sirat to fill Naira's void and wanted her to replace that void, then acted like his family was crazy to expect her to act like Naira like bro you yourself expected that from her. And all that, is what we call grooming. So when people say that Sirat and Kartik had a better marriage than Naira and Kartik, it's because Sirat didn't leave. Naira was of his age, both were young, so she could screech, fight and leave him and he knew that, yet wanted to dominate. But Sirat? Man learnt from his mistakes. By that time, he was already older, had mastered control, hence was ready to groom her like he wanted, made her Naira 2.0, which is why that marriage lasted longer. Other than Aarohi, there's nothing that Sirat gained from that marriage, but it was a win for Kartik lol. ",

It gave 'right person, wrong story' and thats why I believe they deserved a separate series as leads. Here in their case fate tried but love still won somehow. Idc whatever paople say but for me Shaad × Jannat &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Aahil × Sanam. Varun and Surbhi really shared a frame of comfort I never wanted to lose. 🤍\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "\nI was rewatching some of my favorite episodes of Kasam Tere Pyaar Ki, and I noticed a huge difference in the way Rishi treated Tanu (before her reincarnation) and Tanuja (after her reincarnation).\n\nWith Tanu, Rishi was always gentle, respectful, and deeply in awe of her. He never shouted at her, never interrupted her mid-conversation, and certainly never dragged or manhandled her. Even when she scolded him, he would quietly listen, almost like a lovesick puppy. There was a softness in the way he looked at her pure admiration and love  that made their entire pre-leap story feel magical.\n\nBut after the reincarnation, Rishi’s behavior towards Tanuja (post her plastic surgery ) was completely different. His love turned into anger and aggression. He physically manhandled her multiple times, raised his voice often, and even slapped her once. He doubted her character, accused her unjustly, and threw her out of his life more than once. It was such a stark contrast that it almost felt like a different person altogether and couple.\n\nI could never have imagined the Rishi from before the leap behaving this way. He was flawed, yes, but he was never cruel or violent. That’s why his change in behavior after the reincarnation always bothered me.\n\nWas it just lazy writing  added for the sake of TRPs  or was it meant to show that Rishi could never truly love anyone the same way he loved Tanu? Even though Tanuja was Tanu reborn,  Or maybe, in trying to make the post-leap story more intense, the writers forgot the essence of what made Rishi and Tanu’s love story so special in the first place.\n ",

I don’t know what the makers are thinking; it feels like they just want to add unnecessary drama and turn it into another saas-bahu story.\n\nI know Virat has done wrong things. He used to be a thief, he lied about his family, and even hid that he’s rich. Something happened between him and his dad after his brother’s death, so maybe that’s why he cut ties and lies about his past. But even after all this, he still has a chance at forgiveness because his intentions toward Anvi are genuine. He’s changing for her — he left stealing, started earning honestly, wants to complete his MBA, and is slowly becoming a better person.\n\nVirat has done so much for Anvi — things not everyone knows. He saved her house, protected her brother from going to juvenile detention ( because of Sanjay’s plan to trap Virat), and helped her family several times. When Anvi learns the full truth, she’ll see how Virat was never using her but genuinely trying to change for her.\n\nOn the other hand, Sanjay. He has known Anvi since childhood. He saw her suffer when her mom abandoned the kids, he saw her take care of everyone single-handedly — and still, he’s using her pain to win her. He’s playing dirty tricks just to marry her, even after Anvi clearly told him she only sees him as a friend. He exposed Virat’s secret to Hetal and even informed Virat’s mom about the marriage just to create problems between them.\n\nAt first, I was confused about whom Anvi should choose — Sanjay or Virat. I know Virat is not perfect. He’s made big mistakes, and yes, he’s not exactly a good person yet. But at least he’s trying to change. Sanjay, on the other hand, has become selfish and manipulative. What he’s doing isn’t love; it’s selfishness. He’s going to lose Anvi completely — not just as a lover, but as a friend too.",

    "content": "What you guys think why Balika Vadhu 2 not work out at same as Balika Vadhu 1 which was blockbuster of all time. \n\n\nI have watched both season as their many things that in lacking I felt.. .\n\n1. Over used of Supporting characters in season 2. As season 1 supporting characters was so much that they were like a lead of the show. I guess that makers overconfident to start seriel only with supporting cast in season 2 not with Anandi. Where in season 1 the episode and scenes start with Anandi. It's really important for any show to connect first with leads then supporting characters. \n\n2. Not having any connection between season 1 and 2. Like another sequels that has starting with season 1 backbone like sasural Simar ka, kyu ki etc. they started absolutely new show. No connection between season 1. As characters were dies in season 1. That's what make audience not able to connect with season 2. \n\n3. Only name sake Anandi. Where in season 1 Anandi's played by three different actresses.  They character always remained same. Larger then life character. The inspiring one. Anandi used to have her own uniqueness. She was slower the slane, have ambitious, fire of bringing change in the society, never give up atitude etc. where season 2 Anandi look like any other fl character of show. She was good but as much as season 1. As audience in my minds it is she same Anandi I have seen in season 1 or different. One episode come and then I realised her name is just annadi. She actually not that Anandi who i have seen for 8 years. \n\n4. They have shown Balika Vadhu season 1 as TV seriel in Balika Vadhu season 2. This one really heartbreak when they showed in season 2. They can show that new annadi read Balika Vadhu book that they showed in the last episode of Balika Vadhu 1 written by Anandi daughter for her. Anad this Anandi take inspiration from her.. \n\nWhat you guys think. Why it's getting flopped. \n\nIs it reason of Cast, story, character or anything more.. just new actress never clicked as Anandi aa previous three...  \n\nAs audience when I expected to see season 2 my main reason always having nostalgia factor. I want to relived with memory with same characters and actors.  \n\nShare your thoughts on this....\n",

The Sudesh–Nia pairing was iconic — pure gold.\n\nSo how on earth do they retain Abhishek, Samarth, and Elvish, but not Sudesh, Nia, Ankita, or even Reem and Rubina to some extent?\n\nAnd now, to make things worse, they’ve added the Chugli Gang — Eisha, Vivian, and yet another “pick-me” from BB17, Isha. Seriously?\n\nAlso, Tejasswi doing Laughter Chefs after being a MasterChef finalist just feels like a downgrade.\n\nWhy couldn’t they retain the older members or bring back someone like Arjun instead?

Yes aggresive, a bit sarcastic and had a superiority complex. But i still remember how his character in humpty Sharma overshadowed varun Dhawan for me. \n\nHim as a charming nice guy was the best decision of balika vadhu...

    "content": "Right from the looks of characters to interiors of their sets, whenever ITV has to portray a story with Bengali background, I adore how they do things differently. \n\nIntro scenes highlighting yellow taxis, Howrah bridge, ghats of Bengal, and big havelis with unique interiors (paintings and other antique stuff). \n\nCelebrations are done differently (Ulu Dhwani) - rituals have distinct names (Aashirwad Ceremony, Aadan Pradan, etc.).\n\nWedding Looks are Unique (Kolka, Topor). \n\nThe veterans using Bengali Language with that sweet accent (Aami Aasche).\n\nEven Police have a distinct white uniform. \n\nNot to forget the Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Sindoor Khela, Karwa Chauth - Such an aesthetic visual treat! The Background Music - I give it to Ekta Kapoor and her team for this - They have the best versions of mantras of Durga Maa and Kali Maa. \n\nThe integration of dramatic events in the story with these festivals and ceremonies with that background music and mantra hit different. \n\n\\+ Horror/Supernatural tracks in shows with Bengali background are a dramatic applause.",

Always gave more importance to his mother and sisters. Him not attending aasha's (sonakshi's mother) funeral because he was busy in business was huge disappointment. \n\n2) Ram was blind family man. First pampered his sister so much. Then after marriage,\nhe gave more importance to his daughters. He was ready to leave priya because his daughter pihu wanted it. \n\n3) We all know about arnav's sister obsession. The less said the better. And I don't think his priorities changed till the end. \n\n4) Raman truly never saw Ishita as his kid's mother. Whenever a problem arises, he never hesitates to remind her she is not his kids real mother. Sometimes he even gave more importance to shagun as mother than ishita. \n\n5) SSO's whole arc is getting blackmailed every now and then which makes him to choose his family over annka. Every time. Only in kalyani mansion track he choose annika. But after that he went back to square one. After their remarriage, leaving her on marriage day, coming back after 2 weeks with new fake wife publicly was the last straw. \n\nI mean I do get that we all prioritise our sister, parents first. But my problem is these shows never show fl prioritising their family. \nMls can put their family as first priority but fls always supposed to see their husbands family as their own. \n\n\n",

    "title": "My Top 15 ITV show couples (no particular order)",
    "content": "Saloni-Nahar (Saat Phere - Zee Tv)\nThey as a couple made me smile. I was too young to understand ITV shows back then but how Nahar was so supportive towards Saloni was good to watch. Their chemistry and acting was really good too!\n\nHiten-Gauri (Karan-Nandini from Kyunki Saas Kabhi Bahu Thi /Gauri-Pratham from Kutumb)\nI just love the chemistry of this duo regardless of the show. The fact they are a married couple in real life makes it even more wholesome. Their compatibility is good though I feel the Karan-Nandini storyline could have been handled better and did not utilize their chemsity fully.\n\n\nSadhna-Alekh (Sapna Babul Ka Bidaai - Star Plus)\nThis used to be the only ITV show my late grandma watched. I used to watch it with her sometimes and loved the chemistry of Sadhna-Alekh. I am glad they didn’t show Sadhna evil just cause she is the fair one and instead the more innocent one. The way she took care of Alekh when he was not stable mentally. And their background music was so good. Their chemistry got better after Alekh recovered.\n\n\nAnurag-Taani (Tere Liye - Star Plus)\nI still don’t understand how this show got low trps. It was a good show. I really found the story of Anurag and Taani touching. Like childhood love and then after the grew up. Anurag had the Hritik Roshan glow up in Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Ghaam. Still feel this was the best chemistry Harshad had with a co-star till date.\n\nRam-Priya (Bade Aache Lagte Hain - Sony)\nThis show was refreshing to watch initially. I loved the concept of late marriage. Though they got married for their siblings, how their love developed was even better to watch. They both weren’t perfect but supported each other. Ram and Sakshi nailed their characters in this show.\n\n\nDidnt watch ITV shows in between for some years then started again around 2015. That’s when I matured and understood shows better.\n\nZain-Aliya (Beintehaa - Colors)\nMy first show I watched on Colors. Also the fact they were a Muslim couple which was rare in ITV after Asad-Zoya back then. I loved the chemistry of the leads , the story was okay too till the divorce which was ironically supposed to be the main concept of the show. Crazy how the leads didnt get along at all offscreen but can have this kind of chemistry.\n\n\nViplav-Dhaani (Ishq Ka Rang Safed - Colors)\nWhat I really liked about this couple was their innocence which was a rare thing in ITV in that period. The widow concept was a good social message and Viplav was a mature and sensible character too. Mishal did well in this show and justified his popularity. Good debut by Eisha too.\n\nPreet-Ishaan (Pyaar Ko Ho Jane Do - Sony)\nI feel they are one of the most underrated ITV couples. I think show might have gotten much better ratings if it was on Star or Zee kinda channel. I loved the twist. Ishaan’s dark character was actually the interesting part in the show. I thought the chemistry of Mona and Iqbal was really great, they should do more shows together.\n\nRanveer-Ishani (Meri Aashiqui Tumse Hi - Colors)\nThis show started as a one-sided love story of Ranveer. But then they decided to make Ranveer rich and change the concept of the show. Liked the initial concept , but also it was good to see Ranveer and Ishani being a couple as they really looked good together in the show. I just wish they had  handled Ishani’s character better in the show.\n\nShravan-Suman (Ek Duje Ke Vaaste - Sony)\nHonestly speaking this show and couple is one of my very strong favs. It’s one of the rare ITV shows I watched from 1st till last episode. It started really fresh but then idk what happened and the ending was abrupt. Suman-Shravan’s story just started and they pulled the plugs off because of some offscreen issues which was just really unfortunate. I still think Shraman’s chemistry was not even 50% utilized in this show.\n\nThapki-Bihaan (Thapki Pyaar Ki - Colors)\nTbh the concept of the show was unique but the storyline was handled very badly. It had a lot of unrealistic plots but somehow I went through many episodes of it because of how good Thapki and Bihaan’s chemistry was. Thapki had a better story with Dhruv but the chemistry with Bihaan worked wonders. But then the storyline went worse and so bad that I stopped watching it.\n\n\nIshaana-Omkara (Ishqbaaz - Star Plus)\nI started watching Ishqbaaz for the 3 brothers concept but then I really loved Ishaana and Omkara as a couple. They only had one month I think, and their story didn’t even start, but I could see the potential and chemistry. Don’t remember if they scrapped of Ishana’s storyline or the actress quit, but it was sad to see her go. It would have been unique to see them as a couple though Omkara did look good with Gauri but their storyline was very common.\n\n\nAkshat-Guddan (Guddan Tumse Naa Ho Payega - Zee TV)\nI watched this show randomly and it really surprised me. From promos they showed it as if Guddan will marry some old guy, but it was just a middle aged guy who adopted kids when he was young. I think I loved this show mainly cause the chemistry of Akshat-Guddan and also the character of Guddan who was underconfident but then got a supportive husband like Akshat. This show was doing really good till they brought Akshat’s dead wife back.\n\n\nSaanchi-Kabir (Savitri Devi - Colors)\nThough it was kinda evident they will pair up Saanchi with Veer since Veer was played by Varun, I prefer her pairing with Kabir. They had a much more natural chemistry and were also similar to each other. I wish they were a couple instead. I stopped watching after they made Saanchi-Veer a couple.\n\nRam-Priya (Bade Acche Lagte Hain S2 - Sony)\nThe only post 2020s ITV couple I really liked. I actually watched this show cause it was sequel of the OG Bade Ache Lagte Hain despite the different cast. I was surprised to see Nakuul playing a soft character and Disha playing a tough character but I loved this storyline too.  I think Nakuul-Disha being a pair in a show before worked out well for them here. This show was a good quality show but then it kinda lost the appeal after the leap. No idea what happened after Nakuul-Disha quit this show.\n",

Mauli choosing Ishaan over Kunal was just perfect, one of my favorite ITV endings.I was honestly so happy when Mauli chose Ishaan over Kunal.\n\nShe didn’t choose the man she once loved.\nShe chose the man who never made her feel unloved.\n\nOne of the most quietly powerful endings ever. No shouting, no drama, just emotions that spoke for themselves. I as really happy because she chose Ishaan over her ex-husband Kunal, who had cheated on her with her so-called best friend Nandini. That made her decision feel even more empowering.\n\nIt’s so rare in ITV to see a female lead choose the second male lead instead of the main hero. This was one of the few shows where the female lead chose peace, respect, and stability over old love, and honestly, I loved that. It felt mature, realistic, and deeply satisfying.\n\nMauli didn’t just move on ,she evolved.\n\n",

Just yesterday, someone posted that this song is the only OG essence left in the show, and having all the leads and their children’s entries set to this song felt like such a beautiful coincidence💕. That’s why I felt compelled to share it here. I know everyone’s tired of what this show has turned into, so maybe this edit wasn’t really needed, but I couldn’t help myself.\n\nVery quickly, I was back to feeling sad and somewhat disgusted. It’s honestly disheartening to see what this show has become. I never watched Gen 3 or Gen 4 properly, but I’ve seen enough to know how far they strayed from the soul of the original Yeh Rishta. (Let’s be honest, Gen 2 wasn’t any saint either, but at least it didn’t start right away as a love triangle.)\n\nTo this day, I still can’t believe Harshad agreed to do this show 😑 maybe because I had seen his previous work and LOVED him, and maybe because I had this perception of him choosing shows based on their scripts. Kya pata, Abhimanyu really did sound good to him 'on paper'.\n\nNonetheless, I hope no new faces are added to this edit, except Gen 5 — because that’s definitely going on floors, however long it may take.\n\n([reel link](https://www.instagram.com/p/C03Eyahvazd/))",

Imo Rohit is just a descent actor but ig Aman's potential isn't truly utilised yet, he can do much better in future. \n\n2. According to the current scenario Aditi (Mitali) is performing better than Tanisha (Vrinda), like I clearly remember the scene where Mitali was laying on bed and trying to scare 'Maharaj (rasoiya)' &amp; also the scene where she met Ranvijay &amp; Suhas related to Vrinda's marriage, her expressions were so on point She's perfectly handling Mitali's character imo at least. Tanisha is also a really good actress but I am saying again (coz I've said it multiple times) that Ekta is not truly utilising her potential. Like ksbkbt2 has completed 85 episodes and we haven't shown a single scene where we can see Vrinda's true emotions and feelings. \n\n3. Shagun (Pari) is such a horrible actress and I've not seen any improvement in her acting skills, same expressions and her dialogue delivery is just meh. About Prachi I can say that she's doing better than Shagun and her screen presence is also good. I hope, in future we get to see her true potential. \n\nDrop your opinions!! \n\n*Btw Ekta bhool gayi hai kya ki Pari ko expose bhi karna hai, mujhe to samajh hi nahi aa raha ki vo karna kya chahti hai, Naa hi to Pari ko expose kara rahi hai na hi Noina ka love triangle aage badh raha hai.

    "content": "I came across a promo just now and it showed a woman getting nervous while seeing Mangal and immediately reporting to someone that Mangal is back. And to confirm it, she goes to an archive room and finds Mangal’s file. Do you think the story is gonna be about how this new dude they introduced is actually Mangal’s long lost son and Ishana isn’t her biological daughter? I don’t watch the show but I went down the rabbit hole of watching few clips and they have shown this new dude who is practically a delinquent and is always troubling Mangal. It’s giving the usual trope of long lost child who is a petty thief or criminal. But why would they switch children if there weren’t gonna raise the dude? I honestly don’t even know his name. But I am pretty sure this show is heading towards estranged parent-child trope and Mangal will try to create a bond with this son and Ishana will get jealous or something. \n\nOr maybe Mangal was pregnant with twins and Ishana and the son is both her biological kids? But I don’t think that’s likely because she probably would have known if she was gonna have twins. I know India doesn’t allow gender testing so it’s easier to have a baby swap story. \n\nSo if you guys are watching the show completely, do you think this is where the story is headed? I think it’s headed down that direction based on the promos I have seen. Also, I saw Saumya is back and she is allegedly pregnant. But is she actually? I don’t think she is. She lied about her pregnancy before. She is trying to be Mangal 2.0 with her new avatar but I ain’t buying it. I am sure she is plotting something. Like I said, I don’t watch the episodes so I don’t know if I have missed more details. ",

    "content": "I was just randomly rewatching this episode.\nThis is the episode where khushi goes to the AR office after resigning to get her things back. She thinks since it's Sunday he won't be there. But surprise surprise he is! \n\n\nWhen she enters the office(and hasn't seen him yet) she could sense him and he could sense her(arshi being arshi) but she still tries convincing herself that he isn't there.\n\nWhen she sees him, she is anxious and wants to get out as soon as possible, wanting nothing to do with him, giving him no chance to talk to her(which he really really wants to)\n\n\nShe goes to the storeroom to get her belongings and he follows her there, he has to tell her his side of the story about the broken building fiasco. Before this whenever he has tried, she is angry, contemptuous,anxious and running away, he had tried when they had met in the temple on Teej too. \n\n\nThe entire storeroom sequence is no different in this regard. She tries to walk out, but he comes up behind her and shuts the door, breaking the door knob in the process. She even goes to see if she could get out of the window(😂) but no hope there too. \n\n\nWhen she opens the window, and it gets all windy and her dupatta flies to his face and she gets even more anxious and conscious, it's obviously a cliche scene but their chemistry works so so well. He returns her her dupatta without looking at her.\n\n\nShe BTW has been silent all throughout the episode, he even says to her \"waise to kabhi tumhara munh band nahi rehta\"\n\nBut eventually he provokes her into verbal anger. She tells him to stop telling her what she can and can not do, she tells him to break the door down like he broke her phone because she wants to get out. He asks her if she will listen to him if he breaks the door down, she kind of gives her approval. But when he brings the door down, she hurriedly picks up devi maiya's murti, tells him she does not want to listen to him(cheater KKG😂), that since he hates her so much he should get happy coz she is going back to Lucknow \"hamesha hamesha ke liye\" and dashes out of the store room. \n\nWhen she said she was going away forever he was shocked into silence for a few seconds, finding his voice only after she has ran out \"tum aise nahi jaa sakti ... Khushi! KHUSHI!\"\n\n\nFor this situation he never got to tell his side of the story. At least after he had been rude to her on his parents' death anniversary he was able to eventually apologise to her, even if she had tried ignoring him then too.",

They're nice actors. They've done some memorable projects. Have nice following and are good but they're definitely not the people for Naagin. Sorry, Tejaswini and Simba had good chemistry in Naagin 6but before it started airing vs even after it went off air I had only one thing to say- Tejaswini wasn't fit for the role of Naagin not because her acting is bad nope but because it didn't really suit her. Honestly Surbhi Jyoti at first I also didn't think I'd like( not the trailer based on rumours of her casting)but she slayed the role and made me change my opinion. If they do something else, other projects I'd like to watch but not Naagin. Whether Vivian or Namik you can honestly compare the two actors with each different actress- and for me there was honestly no chemistry. Eisha Vivian have starred in one show already but I don't really think they had the chemistry. Priyanka and Vivian neither. Namik and Eisha -hmm honestly I'm not sure here but it can't be that good. Namik and Priyanka -No. Vivian and Namik do have the vibes for a show like Naagin- especially that dragon thing but Eisha Priyanka not really. However, I'd really like to Know the casting you guys prefer!! Do share ideas. ✨",

    "content": "Let’s be honest — Indian TV doesn’t really *do* hatred-to-love. What we get is just mouth-pouting, sarcastic banter, and overused “funny” background sounds every time the leads argue. The so-called “rivalry” exists only because the ML is a grumpy, rich, workaholic man and the FL is written as the “bubbly opposer” who trips over air everytime she senses him near. Or maybe he \"hates\" her is  because he loves someone else although It's only because writers want a subplot so they won't have to think every day - stretched over 200+ episodes of sulking, feeling desire for fl, misunderstandings, dramatic shouting and drama. He could’ve married his first love, but then where would they get the “tension”? So instead, he sulks, fights, and the FL acts as the abla naari while the drama just keeps repeating.But when she comes back - she also lasts for 150+ epsiodes then again subplot then she's send away after he realises his feelings for fl. \n \n Lik,out of nowhere, they’re married — and she’s(fl) already daydreaming about him. Like... where was the hatred? Where was the emotional tension? The genuine clash of values? Everything turns into domestic longing and random eye-locks before they’ve even *resolved* anything.\n \nWhat we call *hate-love* in Indian serials is usually just arrogance + forced proximity + background music. There’s no slow burn, no internal conflict, no actual dislike — just pre-decided chemistry shoved into the same “shaadi ke baad feelings aa gaye” formula.\n \nCan we, for once, have leads who truly *can’t stand each other* — who go through raw, uncomfortable growth instead of falling in love the moment the sindoor hits?\n  \n ",

    "content": " Id love to hear about the underrated or forgotten gems that stayed with you. Here are some of mine:\n\nSuhani Si Ek Ladki\nMy mom loved this show, and I ended up liking it too. The FL wasn’t the typical “doormat” type — she was simple and middle-class, but also smart, confident, and well-educated. Unlike many current shows where “simple” equals “illiterate,” Suhani held her ground.\nShe walked out when she realized her husband didn’t love her, constantly stood up to her MIL who belittled her for her looks and background, and stayed strong even after her assault. I also liked how the ML actively protected their marriage, rather than the FL being the only one fighting for it (which is more common in ITV).\n\nNisha Aur Uske Cousins\nThe cousin bond and that fun-loving joint family setup felt so refreshing! I especially enjoyed Phase 2 (the Nibir track). Nisha and Kabir had great chemistry, and the show didn’t take itself too seriously — it balanced lighthearted moments with genuine warmth really well.\n\nEverest\nSuch a unique concept — a girl chasing her dream of climbing Everest! I loved the team dynamic, the training track and the realistic portrayal of the sexism and politics in that field. It was ambitious and inspiring in its storytelling.\n\nDhadkan Zindagi Kii\nI have a soft spot for medical dramas that focus equally on patients and doctors’ lives. This limited series nailed that balance. My mom and I used to count down episodes together! The show also tackled misogyny and hospital politics, especially around having a female chief. Dr. Deepika’s professionalism and confidence were a breath of fresh air among FLs who often forget their careers within 20 episodes.\n\nTamanna\nThis aired when women’s cricket barely got attention, and I found Dharaa’s story really compelling. From being a promising cricketer who lost everything due to an abusive husband to a single mom coaching a struggling team — it felt grounded, empowering, and way ahead of its time. As a young adult, I found her such an inspiring character.\n\nKya Kasoor Hai Amla Ka\nA remake of a Turkish show, but Pankhuri Awasthy as Amla was outstanding. It dealt with heavy themes — rape, trauma, social judgment — and Amla’s pain felt very real. Despite the disturbing premise, it was a powerful, empathetic portrayal of survival.\n\nNow I’m curious — what are your lesser-known or underrated ITV shows that deserve more love? 🩵",

    "content": "I am currently watching this show and i am never interested in off screen rumours of co actors. But they haave 4 lead actors and all was so messed up that it got me interested so sorry for this to discuss but.. and please i myself is finding weird so pls dont attack me for so much gossip as i was free for this week watching bts.\n\nNamish - Tejasvi: Namish knew tejasvi before hand from the show so she was more close to him and they share the same bond still\n\nVarun - Tejasvi : Varun also knew tejasvi before the show .\nAnd the most important part was tejasvi was a good friend of varuns wife too as it was their that she played a cupid between them. So varun was at very ease with tejasvi as she was his wifes friend also but very shy and reserved with helly as he was married in fear of rumours spreading. Now varun is divorced and even tejasvi doesnt follow varuns wife dhanya\n\nHelly - Tejasvi :  It feels like They both simply dont like each other much . In between they unfollowed each other and when it came in media i guess they said they had a silly fight and again followed back but helly said in big 2025 that she last talked to tejsavi when she wished her for bigg boss winning stinct three years back and even they dont have insta activity a tall. They follow each other just for namesake\n\nNamish - Helly : They seem cordial with each other. As she took both varun and namish name and said we talk on and off. They collaborated for one alone song dance reel for song 3 years back and they like each other posts too sometimes\n\nHelly - Varun: They were good friends even helly said she was most comfortable with varun in doing scenes as compared to namish or teja as even they both were from Ahmedabad. They were fun but then helly used to be very open and bubbly in interviews and used to call varun cute and all and varun used to tease helly but was very shy and reserved and used to think anything before saying or describing about helly that it would give fire to rumours but still their interviews were good but in the latter part of the show there joint interviews got rare and when in one interview they asked about off screen bond varun told its very professional to avoid rumours i guess and helly interuppted saying it was professional and friendly and varun agreed.\nEven there were rumours about dhanya on social media fighting with swasan fans and saying helly tortures varun in india forum old discussion page somewhere shortly after show ended .As varun wasnt on instagram or any social sites . Helly used to be fun and bubbly on camera with every co star but namish was more responsive as he wasnt married. But even after show ended they both were seen in zee show event addressing press in group in 2019 and also in reunion party .\n\nThey both dont follow each other on instagram other cast follows and vice versa and helly said in her interview in june she said varun se bi hojati hai bat, namish se bi hojati hai on and off call p nhi to instagram pe and also mentioned varun se bi its been few months, she talked for long with varun 2-4 months back. They are in touch but never followed each other on insta, its weird. Seems like a married man bond with a co star problem.\n\nWas any one from here active that time on india forum or anyone has any tea about the same?",

Even Naagin had lesser green screen effects than this show, so why is this show out of budget to shoot in an actual location? Many shows I’ve watched have barely used green screen for the background but yet this show uses it like 80% of the time.\n\nThe Durga Puja and Kali Mahaepisodes were a literal hard watch. The Durga Puja was literally just so poorly edited, and they just edited the VFX to make it look like it was captured in night but the quality was so poor. Even the recent Mahaepisodes, the quality was VERY terrible!! I hope this show goes off air soon, these producers keep dragging on Shaoli’s track, and it’s annoying as hell.\n\n",

Started normally, then progressively the voice broke, tears held back, but the emotions clearly conveyed.\n\nTulsi for her part truly evoked pathos. The silent expressions initially conveyed shock and disbelief. That soon turned into overwhelming longing and sadness for Ba when she held the letter in her hand and saw her handwriting. The inability to read out the words due to being overcome with emotions with her hands and voice quivering captured the emotions perfectly. I am sure many in the audience cried with her.\n\nOverall, it was great throwback to the times when they ruled the screens and proved once again that nobody comes close to these two when it comes to TV.",

Also some of the the actors who would star in episodic roles have made it quite big now. \n\nA second season was aired in 2018 titled \"Zindagi U Turn\" and it was good too. I remember coming back from school to watch these and waiting for weekends to watch the retelecasts. I cannot find them anywhere now. Even Zee5 doesn't host this show.

Wowwwww, how innovative. I am honestly so fed up of show titles that revolve around the FL. I get that they made it a phrase and it also meshes with the plot they are going for, but honestly I am so tired of the repetitive FL-centric show names. There is also no scope of the show exploring anything else because the focus will be all on the FL and just her struggles. \n\nAs for the plot of this show: it’s based on Muslim backdrop in Lucknow. Mahi Vijj is playing the mother role. I know people assumed it was gonna be an age gap romance between young ML and older FL, but nope. Mahi is playing the FL’s mom. Parth is gonna play the Nawab’s son. It’s the same old story with a rich ML with conservative parents and his mom is gonna be the main antagonist. While the FL is underage and wants to make something out of her life 🤡 ",

    "content": "Edit: its about when you are known more as reality show star rather an actor\n\nEspecially those who did like 1-2 good shows, then just switched to **back-to-back reality TV,** YouTube collabs, or appearances that don’t really show growth in acting. It feels like they stop evolving as artists and are more focused on visibility or being “seen” everywhere. Not saying they should not sign ever but if you  are known majorly because of reality shows despite being an actor then i dont  know what to say.\n\nOn the flip side, I feel like actors like **Rajeev Khandelwal**, **Jennifer Winget**, **Shaheer Sheikh**, and **Aditi Sharma** are taken more seriously because they don't overexpose themselves. They don’t jump from one reality show to the next, they pick selective projects and seem more invested in their craft.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way?  \n**Which actors come to your mind who fit this pattern, reality show overdrive vs. consistently working on creative growth?**",

    "content": "So I started watching kyunki with my Nani when it restarted this year and for some backstory on what happened the first time around I read the Wikipedia summary of the first season\nOne of the first things I mentioned was that the ending of the last season said that all the younger generation left the house because Baa willed everything to the long lost son of Karan and Nandini so I was confused as to where everyone’s money came from and where this kid was\nWhen they mentioned that Parth inherited the old place I realized it should be that Baa willed what was in her own name to him and probably everything else was given to Mihir (idk how fair that it but whatever) so I went back to Wikipedia to brush up on that storyline\nSo idk how accurate this summary was but it said that at the end of the show Mihir had Alzheimer’s (which ig not in this new show) and that Parvati shows up and tells Tulsi that she had raised Parth - idk how she got him but apparently the ending was a cliffhanger\nAt this point I’m a little confused because even if we assume that she handed Parth back to Tulsi who gave him to Karan - how does Karan believe he has the right to yell at Parth for selling the old haveli to the Agarwals when they were also literally Parth’s family \nEven more confused with Mihir’s attitude of I can just take what Baa gave to Parth to give to Parsi (not even some type of compensation was discussed) when the whole reason (I’m assuming) Baa willed it to him was to make up for him being lost when he was a baby which was because of Mandira the one Mihir had an affair with. Like he cheated in his marriage and for so long and when she went crazy she took your grandson (among a whole bunch of other crazy things) and you feel you’re entitled to take your grandson’s compensation for all psycho like Pari - it’s insane\nEspecially because as elders yeah you can give what you want to whoever you want but that’s limited to your own things - what Baa gave was never yours so you have to right to demand it (In case you haven’t picked up I have a lot of frustration for Mihir’s character - he’s irresponsible egotistic and just plain annoying which is made so much worse when the show tries to whitewash him by portraying him as Ram Bhagwan after he effs something up) \n\nAnywaysssss actually my question is about Parth specifically - there’s an actor listed as playing a character named Parth in the Wikipedia page for Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki so is that the Kyunki Parth or just someone else because the character doesn’t show up in the summary for the show and I couldn’t find what his actual role was online",

On the other hand, a few days ago, Baa was talking about one of her childhood friends, Damini, who broke off their friendship for some unknown reason. Baa said she misses her and feels guilty about it.\n\nThe whole setup seems very similar to Saathiya’s 10-year leap, where Gopi stabbed Radha and was sent to jail for 10 years. After Gopi’s release, Kokila’s childhood friend Gaura returned. Gaura had ended their friendship years ago after her brother Karunesh’s suicide, which happened due to a misunderstanding caused by Kokila. She came back to take revenge on her.\n\nThere’s no news about any leap so far. However, a few days ago, the casting director of DKP posted a story about auditions for 4–5 new roles in Anupama. It’s possible that Anupama might start following Saathiya 10 years leap storyline for a while; though this is just my assumption, and there’s no confirmation from the production team or anyone else so far.",

    "content": "Hey guys, there are many old TV shows that we used to watch earlier which used to be so good that we like to rewatch them sometimes till now on YouTube or OTT platforms. For me those will be :-\n\n1. Pyar Ki Yeh Ek Kahani - I really love this show. So different from the usual Saas Bahu Serials back in 2010. I like to rewatch the show sometimes on YouTube. Vivian as the Vampire Abhay Raichand was magic. And Sukirti and his chemistry was really good.\n\n2. Remix - Huge huge fan of this show back then. So different. It was so fresh story about school friends and music something which had not been attempted on TV before. I love to rewatch some episodes again and again.\n\n3. Kahin To Hoga - huge fan of this show. Especially Rajeev Khandelwal as Sujal blew my mind. And loved Shabbir Ahluwalia as Rishi was good too. I like to rewatch some episodes of the show now and then till Rajeev was there.\n\n4. Jodha Akbar - Beautiful show. Rajat Tokas as Akbar and Paridhi Sharma as Jodha was outstanding. And the other cast too. I like to rewatch the show sometimes till Jodha gives birth to Salim. \n\n5. Katha Ankahee - I know it was a bit controversial. But the story was so different unlike other shows we have seen on TV. And Aditi Sharma as Katha was mind blowing. And Viaan’s character was unlike any ML story we have seen on TV. Adnan Khan did a good job. And the entire cast was too good. I like to watch the show on SonyLiv sometimes and the good part is I don’t get bored at all. My only complaint is they should have ended the show with the marriage. But post the leap too, the actors gave their best performance till the show ended.\n\nI would love you all to give your opinion.\n\nThere’s only one request. Please refrain from using inappropriate language in your comments. \n\nThanks\n\n\n",

    "content": "So, when I was around 12 or 13 years old, I used to watch this show Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya. I have memories of it, and I remember it was the first time I saw a Same-gender relationship in a movie or show. It was kind of shocking for me back then because I had never seen anything like it before. But looking back, it feels really nice to see representation of such love stories. I just realized that even in mainstream Bollywood—and some TV shows—there’s still a lack of representation of LGBTQ relationships.\n\nI hope to see more stories like this being told in the future.\n",

    "content": "Kinjal Dave (Nidhi Shah, now Milloni Kapadia) stood out in Anupamaa as a refreshing, progressive female character. Unlike typical TV heroines who are either doormats or vamps, Kinjal feels real , a working mom balancing career, family, and chaos with grit. Here’s why she’s a gem, with examples till the time I watched the show-\n\nCareer and Family Juggle: \n\nKinjal works a corporate job while managing Shah household duties and raising Aarya. She doesn’t quit her job to “save the family,” showing women can do both without fanfare.\n\nHandling Harassment:\n\n When her creepy boss harasses her, Kinjal reports it and leans on Anupamaa for support. She processes the trauma realistically, without over-the-top drama, making it a powerful, grounded arc.\n\n\nNavigating Toshu’s Betrayal:\n\n After Toshu cheats, Kinjal confronts him, considers her daughter’s future, and chooses reconciliation with clear boundaries. Post-time leap, she’s flawed (her Aarya comments sting), but it’s human, not villainous.\n\nShe is one of the most progressive and memorable character written in a long time and Nidhi Shah did full justice to the character.  \n\nWhat's your favorite kinjal moment?

Everything feels so relatable,  delhi vibes, the home setup,  food scenes, the dialogues, especially oldiess… legit feels like real life.\n\nAnd I gotta say, I relate to Mehek on a spiritual level. She is healthy like me (iykyk 😌) and her another common thing is cooking. My comfort activity. And yeah not to mention the lessons we have to hear on daily basis that get in shape otherwise nobody will choose you. Lol. But small difference is I dont really care. Hehe. 🙂‍↔️\n\nAnd yupppp. The direction is so on point. Acting? Everyone is killing it, though the leads could have polished it a bit more qk gusse mein acha lagna is sooo important for me, but their CHEMISTRY???? Bruhh.....🔥🔥🔥\n\n The tension, the gaze, the eye contact, the slow burns. They are practically seducing each other with just looks and the bgm is just cherry on top.🤤🥵\n\nI am only on episode 28 and already giggling and blushing like an idiot every time they share a frame.... send help, I cant stop watchinggg...🫠❤️‍🔥\n\n\n",

I’ve been part of this sub for a while but this is my first post.\n\nI grew up on Indian TV but have mostly stayed away in recent years because of the toxic, overdramatic tracks in shows like Anupama, Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin, and YRKKH.\n\nRecently though, I randomly started watching Bade Achhe Lagte Hain 4 and ended up binging it. I really liked the pretend marriage trope and especially loved how the male lead was genuinely trying to earn the female lead’s family’s approval. It was so refreshing to see that for once — since most shows usually show the opposite dynamic.\n\nBut then, of course, they had to ruin it 🙃 by revealing that all his efforts were part of a revenge plan and that he was secretly super rich. That completely killed the charm for me.\n\nSo now I’m here looking for recommendations — any Hindi shows where the male lead genuinely tries to win over the female lead’s family and prove himself, ideally with some financial background difference between them.\n\nWould love to hear your suggestions! Thank You!💛. ",

    "content": "So few days back saw a post about Aryan from Sadda Haq and that immediately refreshed my memory and I ended up watching S2 just for Aryan and his scenes with Sanyukta. Gosh Aryan was such a sweet character and truly was a support to her when she lost her hopes and kept her passion aside. He selflessly supported her both professionally and emotionally and never really forced her to be in a relationship with him. I am still disappointed with the fact that she ends up with Randhir. But whatever Aryukta scenes were there in the show, it was really sweet. Even though I really loved Aryan, there were instances where I disliked his actions specially when he made a bet to Randhir that within 7 days, he will make Sanyukta commit to him and him disappearing for 3 days just so that she will miss him and that will lead to her giving a commitment to him. But in overall aspects in my pov, Aryan &gt;&gt; Randhir. \nLink to the post which made me watch S2: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTellyTalk/s/OlXsVNmu9k",

    "content": "Sanskar Maheshwari — One of the Most Grounded Redemption Arcs on Indian TV and the best thing about what otherwise would have been a unbearable shit show.\n\nI honestly think Sanskar Maheshwari from Swaragini had one of the most beautifully written and grounded redemption arcs Indian television has ever shown.\nHe didn’t change overnight. His growth — from a vengeful man, to someone with little grey shades, and eventually into a mature, self-aware person was done beautifully.\n\n\n\nEpisode 207 – The Clip\n\nThis episode above where Sanskar takes a stand for himself in front of Swara (after she doesn’t believe him in the Ragini kidnapping case) is very beautifully written.\n\nIn a show that was largely female-lead-centric, watching a male lead quietly assert his self-respect — without aggression, arrogance, or ego — was genuinely refreshing on itv.\n\nWhat made it hit harder was how the writing treated him — not as a hero demanding sympathy, but as a man whose love was selfless, not spineless. His reaction wasn’t about ego; it was about hurt and heartbreak.\n\nUsually, in ITV, the female lead is the one shown reforming or forgiving the flawed male lead. Here, it was the complete opposite — Swara had to reflect and make amends.\n\n\n\nHis Redemption – Clearing His Conscience, Not His Name\n\nWhat I love most about Sanskar’s redemption arc is that it was never about proving himself right to others.\nHe didn’t want to be seen as the hero or gain back people’s trust for glory.\nHe wanted to clear his conscience — to live with integrity and peace after realizing how revenge had broken him. The writing of his character doesnt seek to he or glorified as a hero through his redemption rather it was more of to become human again with the support in the right cause.\n\nIt’s not a redemption driven by guilt alone, but by emotional growth — by learning to love without attachment, and to forgive without forgetting.\nIt’s probably one of the best portrayals of selfless yet dignified one-sided love that ITV has managed to give .\n\n\n\nThe Love Triangle Mess\n\nHonestly, the love triangle between Swara, Ragini, and Lakshya became frustrating after a point. Even after Ragini’s truth came out, Swara’s world still seemed to revolve around her manipulative sister and her immature ex.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanskar — who stood by her through everything — somehow remained her lowest priority in comparison to other two, especially during the fake marriage phase.\nAs a viewer, it was frustrating. I genuinely wanted Sanskar’s character to walk away from that chaos and find peace outside that triangle as soon as ragini truth comes out.\n\n\n\nVarun Kapoor \n\nIt still surprises me that Varun Kapoor moved away from television. If he had continued taking strong TV roles, I honestly believe he’d be as popular (or even more) than his Swaragini co-stars today.\n\n\n\nOff-Screen Stuff\n\nAnd this might sound random, but isn’t it strange how so many iconic on-screen couples from older shows don’t even follow each other on social media without any public rumour of spat?\n\nEven in Swaragini, everyone from the cast follows one another — except Helly Shah and Varun Kapoor.\nThey’ve mentioned being in touch off and on through calls, so it’s clearly not about bad blood.\nIt’s probably because fans start reading too much into it or they dont because they just dont.",

    "title": "Curious case of Nandini Iyer from Anupamaaaaaaaa",
    "content": "Anupamaaa happens to be the YRKKH of our generation.  It's never ending with anupamaaaaaa's safars so I thought let's take a small break from her safar and have a throwback to Nandini's safar, aka the most forgettable character of the show. \n\nSo before anything let me make it clear that I am not against the character or the actor who played it and I have no comments on how she played it. It's just a generic analysis of Nandini 's character from the show. \n\nI remember Samar's character getting all the love from the time the show aired. Everyone was looking forward to his love story arc which was introduced really soon. Nandini Iyer is the US return modern but traditional at heart independent girlie in her mid 20s( the show revealed in some episode she was 25) happens to be his next door neighbor. She was a rather important character but written terribly.  I think the first few episodes were still bearable but after that they just made her a \"mandir ka ghanta\". \n\nAt 25, she was mature enough to balance logic with emotion, which could've made her the perfect counterpart to Samar’s youthful, impulsive nature.\n\nInitially, their chemistry had promise , the friendly banter, shared dance passion, and mutual understanding felt natural. The premise of a \"progressive romance blossoming amidst a regressive household\" had real potential. But from there, the execution started to unravel due to poor writing choices and tonal inconsistencies.\n\nTheir relationship escalated almost immediately after they met. Within a few weeks, Samar was confessing love and Nandini ,who was established as cautious and experienced reciprocated far too soon. The show missed a golden opportunity to develop their bond organically, showing how a modern relationship grows amid conservative surroundings. Instead, it jumped straight into “couple mode,” skipping the emotional build-up that could’ve made them more relatable.\n\nEven more puzzling was how quickly they began discussing marriage. Given Nandini’s age and backstory as someone who’d lived abroad, her instant readiness to tie the knot with a 21-year-old Samar didn’t sit right. \n\nNandini was initially shown as forthright and fearless,  someone who could stand up to Vanraj, Baa, and even Kavya. Yet, the writers repeatedly undercut that strength by making her passive whenever real conflict arose. She went from defending her autonomy to constantly apologizing for things that weren’t her fault.\n\nThe biggest betrayal of her characterization was the secret ex and infertility arc. A woman introduced as emotionally transparent and modern suddenly concealing a previous marriage and medical condition made no sense. It wasn’t depth ,it was lazy shock value. Worse, the show never gave her the space to process it; her trauma became a tool to create drama between Samar and the Shahs rather than to explore her character.\n\nSamar, who had always been portrayed as empathetic and emotionally intelligent, suddenly became reactionary and erratic once Nandini’s past came to light. \n\n\nTheir engagement scene should’ve been a heartfelt milestone, yet it was constantly overshadowed by family politics. When Baa disapproved because of Nandini’s infertility, the narrative should’ve become about love defying societal expectations. Instead, the story devolved into repetitive arguments and guilt-tripping.\n\nWhat’s most frustrating is how much potential this relationship had. Samar and Nandini could’ve been Anupamaa’s modern love story done right ,showing a partnership based on respect, equality, and resilience. Instead, they became victims of lazy plotting and sensational twists.\n\nWhen Nandini’s character was written out, it wasn’t even given proper closure. Her exit to the U.S. was rushed and poorly written. She gets a job in the US and leaves everything behind conveniently. For a character who shared such screen space with leads, she deserved a better exit. \n\nWhat are your observations about Nandini's character? If you remember her lol",

    "content": "I’ve been trying to recall this old **Hindi horror TV show** that aired somewhere between **2000 and 2015**, but I can’t remember its name. I searched a lot but not able to find it.\n\nThe story wasn’t like *Aahat* or *Ssshhh... Koi Hai*.\n\nIt was about a group of **contestants who join a TV reality show**, but then things take a dark twist — the show itself turns **haunted**, and the contestants end up actually running for their lives from ghosts.\n\nIn the **first episode**, they reach a **villa** where they get haunted and some manage to escape. Later episodes have them in a **forest**, then a **haveli** haunted by a ghost family, and so on — each new place, new ghosts and multiple member got killed with each place.\n\nIt wasn’t a real reality show — that concept was just part of the story. It aired in **Hindi**, probably on a major channel like Star Plus, Sony, or Zee TV or not sure...\n\nDoes anyone remember what this show was called? It’s been stuck in my head for years.\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏\n\n\\----- Update ----\n\nI remembered the actor of that show and was able to find the show\n\nIt was - Maut ka khel (Aahat Season 5)\n\nDidn't thought it was part of Aahat as it used to air with name only, but got it.\n\nFound the link too - [https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8soezs](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8soezs)",

I started to watch it when it first initially aired and loved it but recently I’ve been giving it a pause and letting the episode count stack up and then continuing to watch it from whenever I left off. I initially really liked the chemistry between Raghav and Reet but I don’t see it much now which is disheartening. Maybe it’s because I’m watching it in chunks? I also feel like they lost the strong independent woman Reet was in between at some given point and by the looks of it in promos and snip it’s on Zee’s insta page it seems like she’s back in her character from the initial episodes. Raghav’s character is also annoying now as clearly he just refuses to believe anything Reet says and what he’s seen and heard and just blindly believe Buaji. ",

I loved the confrontation between Renuka and Roshni, and Roshni's truthful reality check to Renuka. I also liked how everyone called out Renuka's bias in blaming just the DIL for everything and Sailee's taunt about it to Renuka was gold. Akash was also really good at the end when he yelled at Tejas and demanded his money back. Unlike Sachin, I feel like Akash and Riya wouldn't hesitate to get their hands dirty in order to get their money back.\n\nHonestly, I loved how they also showed the difference between Tejas and Sachin as husbands in a split second. Tejas kept throwing Roshni under the bus to save himself. However Sachin, despite not fully agreeing with Sailee protecting Roshni from getting beat up by Renuka, didn't for a second let Renuka lay her hands on Sailee and instantly shut it down. Like, his baiko can do whatever but no body can't hit her. Tejas just let Roshni get beat and instigated Renuka so he doesn't get the burnt of it.\n\nThis is episode 581 btw.",

    "title": "People keep hating Abhimanyu Birla for one “White Day,” but forget everything that led up to it.",
    "content": "Okay so I’m someone who honestly doesn’t watch daily soaps anymore. Whenever my mom put on *YRKKH 4gen*, I’d usually just leave the room especially during the recent mess and have constantly begged her not to watch this crap.   \nBut being a Harshad Chopda fan, I binge-watched the AbhiRa era recently, and honestly, I can’t understand the hate Abhimanyu gets.\n\nSo here’s my take not as a blind fan, but as someone who looked at his entire journey from start to finish.\n\n**The “White Day” wasn’t born in a day**\n\nPeople hate him for asking Akshara for divorce after Neil’s death and her miscarriage  and yes, it was harsh, painful, and wrong.  \nBut it’s like hitting a wall with a hammer every day ,one day it will collapse.  \nThat’s what happened with Abhi. He was crumbling long before that day.\n\nI’m not saying Abhi was perfect…. far from it.  \nHe was flawed, impulsive, emotional, sometimes even extreme.  \nBut so was everyone else around him.  \nAnd unlike most, he owned up to his mistakes, carried guilt, and still tried to make things right later.\n\nSo yeah, hate him for his mistakes if you must  but don’t erase the emotional trauma and constant pressure that built up to them.  \nHe wasn’t a monster; he was a man pushed past his breaking point.\n\n**From the beginning his love wasn’t shallow**\n\nWhen Abhimanyu first met Akshara, he was mesmerized by her voice. It wasn’t a random crush “love at first sight” only … their connection grew through moments of kindness, empathy, and mutual respect the time they spent during the event and resort . And when he gets to know the girl he’s been going Gaga about is the same girl his family wants him to marry it becomes an actual thing automatically…\n\nThen came the twist his family wanted him to marry *her sister*.  \nHe rejected that alliance immediately, confessed his love for Akshu in front of everyone, while she stayed silent and later rejected him herself.  \nEven then, his family forced him toward Arohi.\n\nImagine hearing all that humiliation, standing your ground for love, and still being asked to marry the other sister it’s absurd.  \nEven then, Abhi tells Arohi clearly that there won’t be love in this marriage. She accepts, and the family manipulates things further feeding him false narratives about Arohi’s goodness and Akshu’s silence.\n\nPeople often say *“Abhimanyu manipulated his way into a confession.”*  \nBut honestly, I saw it more as him putting his heart out there exposing himself emotionally just to see how much Akshu would let him suffer in that false pretence.\n\n**Manipulation and misunderstandings**\n\nArohi *knew* about the phone and message confusion but kept quiet.\n\nAkshu saved Abhi from the fire, but he was made to believe she *left him to die*. Think about how Abhi would have felt that point that all his feelings were in his head , she didn’t even care about him this much it’s almost like going through a breakup . \n\nWhen Akshu did pooja for Manjari, Arohi took the credit.\n\nAnyone in his place would start doubting reality. It’s psychological manipulation, not just “family drama.”\n\nThen came his mother’s accident Akshu *again* hid the truth thinking she was protecting peace.  \nBut silence and half-truths always made things worse. \n\nAnd for those who say *“he was too rude to Arohi”* try to see it from his perspective.  \nHe only knew her through her manipulative, unethical actions and the constant trouble she created for others.  \nAny sane person would be wary of someone like that.Sure, a lot of Arohi’s behavior stems from her upbringing and family dynamics but how is that Abhi’s fault?  \nHe wasn’t judging her past; he was reacting to her present behavior.\n\nPeople forget Arohi was shown as an over ambitious doctor who flaunted her achievements. She topped her MBBS batch, sure but Abhimanyu holds the record for *state topper* and is a *specialist surgeon*. Yet he never boasted, never competed, never looked down on her.Meanwhile, she always acted superior to him like she had to prove something.\n\nThe wedding day confession is actually a bad thing happening to any girl but until this point her character was shown very manipulative calculated so i felt happier for Abhira than sad for Arohi ( cos her feelings were not hurt more like ego crashing )even then she did Ego monologue. \n\n**The wedding and the cycle repeating**\n\nWhen Abhi and Akshu’s wedding finally happened, Abhi ended up doing the same thing Arohi once did  blaming every little thing on Akshu, suspecting her motives.  \nWas it fair? No. But after all the manipulation and silence he had endured, his vigilance was natural.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, Akshu always turned a blind eye to Arohi’s actions. And that left Abhi constantly fighting battles alone for truth, for loyalty, for love\n\n**The emotional weight no one talks about**\n\nOn top of all this, imagine realizing the woman you love carries guilt for her mother’s death since childhood.  \nShe has panic attacks, emotional trauma, and has been forced to carry all of that alone because her family never helped her heal.\n\nFor Abhimanyu, who himself grew up watching his mother suffer, it must’ve been unbearable to see Akshara living with that kind of pain.\n\n**After marriage his fears came true**\n\nWhen Akshu married Abhi, she actually walked into a loving family Manjari adored her, Neil treated her like his own, even Parth and Shefali were warm.  \nThe only real issue was Harshvardhan\n\nAbhi had told Akshu clearly that the family dynamics in the Birla house weren’t like Goenkas.  \nHis biggest fear was seeing Akshu suffer the way his mother had ,quietly, endlessly, emotionally crushed.  \nHe wanted Akshu to prioritize *them* ,their relationship over unnecessary involvement in family politics.  \nThat wasn’t control; it was fear.\n\nHe even asked her for one promise: not to get caught up in these dynamics and to focus on building their bond.  \nWhich, considering his past, was a very logical and emotionally honest request.\n\n**The anniversary incident the most misunderstood moment**\n\nAbhi specifically asked her not to celebrate their anniversary.  \nEveryone told her not to, even if they didn’t explain the full reason but she still went ahead.  \nFor Akshu, it was innocent but for Abhi, it was traumatic.\n\nAs a child, he’d watched his father humiliate his mother during such “celebrations.”  \nSeeing his mother cry over something as simple as cake cutting left a permanent scar.  \nSo when Akshu forced that memory back into his life, all those emotions came flooding back.\n\nAnd still, he didn’t lash out violently just reacted out of shock and suppressed pain.\n\n**The music therapy department gift**\n\nTo make her happy, he built an entire *music therapy department* for her at the hospital a huge gesture of love and respect for her talent.  \nAnd what did he get in return?  \nIn front of everyone, she belittled it because of something his father said — a man Abhi *hated* and had openly opposed.\n\nInstead of talking privately, she publicly rejected the gift.  \nHer intention might’ve been right, but the delivery was cruel.  \nHe had poured love, effort, and respect into that gesture and she crushed it.\n\nEven after that, he kept trying to cheer her up, plan things, and make her smile.\n\n**The Harshvardhan Neil revelation**\n\nThen came one of the most painful moments the revelation that Neil was actually Harshvardhan’s son from an extra-marital affair.  \nIt shattered the whole family, and Abhi, who had always despised his father’s behavior, felt betrayed and disgusted.  \nIt shook his entire sense of identity and faith in family.  \nBut through it all, he still tried to hold himself together for his mother, for Akshu, for the peace of the house.\n\n**When things finally started getting better…**\n\nIt’s not like Akshu “hid” problems, but she never really tried to *solve* them either.  \nAbhi was the one constantly taking steps, trying to fix situations. Their ways of handling issues were completely different he was direct, she avoided.\n\nAbhi was always the mature one like the way he handled his sister and Kairav’s situation.  \nThe moment he realized Akshu was uncomfortable, he came clean, admitted the truth, and dealt with it respectfully.\n\nThen, when his sister attempted suicide, everyone turned on Kairav.  \nAkshu defended him, which is natural but since she *always* defended Arohi earlier, it was hard for Abhi to blindly trust her version this time.  \nAnd then, when an eyewitness came forward saying he saw Kairav *pushing* his sister, any logical person would doubt.\n\nStill, Abhi respected Akshu’s feelings and agreed to give Kairav a chance to explain himself.  \nBut then Kairav *fled*.\n\n**The hand surgery peak stupidity and emotional chaos**\n\nThis was honestly one of the most frustrating parts Akshu’s handling of Abhi’s hand injury.  \nYou have your *own hospital*. If you think a doctor’s intentions are wrong, you inform the board, you raise a complaint you don’t stay silent while he performs the surgery!\n\nEven after the surgery, she could’ve refused to go with that unethical doctor.  \nThere was no proof nothing forcing her to comply.\n\nYes, vows and promises matter, but when the other person’s intentions are evil, ethics come first.  \nYou don’t quietly leave your husband mid-recovery and vanish.\n\nBut that’s what she did she picked up her stuff and disappeared, without a word, without a reason.\n\nAnd then she spends *a whole year* thinking about him, missing him, romanticizing her “sacrifice” in endless monologue she gave after one year  about how she “did the right thing alone.”  \n\n\nMeanwhile, Abhi recovering from surgery, emotionally wrecked, surrounded by people who always opposed their marriage has no idea where his wife is or *why* she left.  \nWhat kind of thoughts would that man be living with? Anxiety, guilt, heartbreak all tangled together.\n\nEven after all that, when he finally hears her voice and meets her again, she says *“Wait for 24 hours.”*  \nLike seriously? You vanish for a year and then say that?  \nOf course he lost his calm.  \nAnyone would. He’s not some monk or Gandhi.\n\nStill, they somehow cleared their misunderstandings later, and the ever-mahaan Akshara was back in Abhi’s life.\n\n**Arohi-Neil chaotic shadi and Pregnancy** \n\nThen comes the Arohi and Neil wedding shit I honestly felt very bad for Abhi. The way Arohi kept poisoning that pure, good-hearted, cheerful soul Neil and created distance between Abhi and Neil I genuinely felt bad. Matlab itne ache Ram Lakshman jese bhai ke beech Surpankha Arohi. Khair, that plot was whatever they wanted to put for drama so I don’t have much to say there.\n\nUske baad the baby wala thingy Arohi was pure evil.  \nAbhi khud sad tha ki he won’t have babies. It wasn’t just Akshu ka sapna; it was his too. But he still tried to be strong and even started looking up treatment options not for himself, but so he could give Akshu some hope and tell her that maybe things can get better, that there’s still a chance. That’s how much he cared.\n\nBut meanwhile, Arohi was being her usual manipulative self using unfair means, trying to create misunderstandings between Abhi and Akshu.  \nAnd yes, maybe at that time Abhi could’ve told Akshu something like, “There might be complications, but I’m talking to specialists  let’s not lose hope yet.” Not to hide it, but to handle it better.\n\nPhir Arohi ka fake pregnancy drama Akshu literally told her to tell the truth. Matlab ek baar galti sabse hoti hai, har baar galti repeat karna bewakoofi hoti hai.  \nThen when Akshu got pregnant, things were going well between them. Abhi was just being a little extra caring haan tone down ho sakta tha thoda but it was honestly cute and nice to watch.\n\n**White day** \n\nThen imagine, he goes out for just one day and sab ujhad gaya. Matlab aisa koi promise nahi maangta ki “room se bahar mat nikalna” unless there’s something serious, and Abhi knew Akshu has a tendency to land in trouble girti, chot khati, phir kuch na kuch hota hai.\n\nShe had stomach pain, okay fine go to the doctor, come back.  \nBut then she got involved in some trafficking mess, saw girls in trouble and instead of waiting for police , she went to fight them herself. Even police officers don’t go fight without backup, so how can she? That was plain stupidity.She could have followed that truck till police came \n\nPhir jo hona tha ho gaya. When Abhi came to the hospital, he was panicking, looking for Akshu everywhere scared out of his mind. And then Akshu said, “I couldn’t save my kids.”  \nMatlab you’re literally feeding that guilt into him. Obviously his mind would break hearing that. Neil died.\n\nNow, of course Akshu didn’t *kill* him, but the circumstances all started because of her impulsiveness. Because of that, Neil died, and with him the two unborn kids of the family. **Not holding her responsible but emotions grief Apko logical reasoning nhi dete**.  \nNeil’s mother and wife were heartbroken, and naturally angry at Akshu — and in that emotional mess, they didn’t want her around.  \nAbhi, who had just lost his brother (who he practically raised like a son) and his unborn children, was also under immense emotional distress. His mother was shattered too.  \nSo when people say “he asked Akshu to leave,” they forget — at that time, everyone was in shock, and he was just trying to handle the chaos. It wasn’t about hate.\n\nAnd haan, grief doesn’t make you logical. When someone’s world falls apart like that, you can’t expect them to act all calm and sensible.  \nAkshu saying “meri kya galti” at that point only made things worse it poked the wound deeper.  \nSo yes, Abhi reacted **extremely badly** but you can’t dump all the show’s blame on him. It was a chain of pain and misunderstanding, not a single person’s fault.\n\nAur phir Akshu ghar chor ke chali gayi matlab why? She could’ve stayed at her family’s house, handled things better, even taken some time apart if needed.  \nBut instead she went off with a stranger lived with Abhinav. And her justification ki “she tried to tell Abhi about the baby” doesn’t hold because she never communicated it properly, and that’s her pattern  hiding, running away, thinking she’s doing sacrifice but actually creating bigger messes.\n\nAbhi was also grieving he lost his brother, kids, trust, everything.  \nSo her vanishing like that only added to the pain.\n\nAur ab agar log bolte hain ki “she left for self-respect,” to mujhe wo bilkul nahi lagta. It wasn’t self-respect, it was poor decision-making. You already had one miscarriage, it was a difficult pregnancy and instead of staying where you’d get support, you chose a difficult lonely life with a stranger? Kaha ki samajhdari thi ye. If she would have stayed at Goenka house and remained separated from Abhi I would have supported it fair and square . \n\nAnd Abhinav haan, he was a good man, kind-hearted, helpful, but people overrate him so much.  \nHe didn’t have the same emotional or family baggage like Abhi.  \nHe was just a simple man who always said yes to whatever Akshu said.  \nThat’s not love that’s compliance.  \nTheir relationship wasn’t real romance or partnership; it was mutual coexistence.\n\nAnd if he was truly that good and selfless, he should’ve told Abhi about Abhir even indirectly which he tried once and failed because of Akshara but he had ample time to think it through and try again.   \nHe was an orphan himself; he should’ve understood the pain of a father losing his child unknowingly. But of course, that wouldn’t serve the show’s drama so they kept it that way.\n\nAnd just like that, their story froze in pain  one walked away to survive, and one stayed behind to suffer.\n\n**Cut to the leap** \n\nAbhi with Roohi was so heartwarming. The way he loved her was all hearts. And yes, Akshara’s life was also good in her own way.  \nBut then they cross paths and for Abhi, it’s tormenting. His whole life falls apart the moment he sees the love of his life moved on, has a husband and a baby the exact dream he had always wished for.\n\nHe doesn’t create any drama. Even after knowing Abhinav’s truth, he stays nice to him. Tell me honestly, who behaves so gracefully with their ex’s current partner, especially when your story ended in such a painful way?  \nHis scenes with Abhir were pure gold so emotional, so raw and then when he apologised to Akshara for what he said about Sirat Maa, that hit deep. The guilt he had carried for years, he finally let it out, admitting he said it in emotional turmoil. And yes, Akshu reacted harshly, but okay she was heartbroken, and it brought back all her past trauma, panic, childhood pain. **And here I don’t blame Akshara this was really bad what Abhi did** and regretted his whole life. \n\nThen Abhinav realised that Abhir was Abhi’s son and all this while, he had thought Abhi was some bad, angry man. But after spending time with him, he saw what kind of person Abhi really was kind, good-hearted, caring. If he was truly that “achha aadmi” he claimed to be, he could’ve at least told Abhi the truth that this was his son. Even indirectly.\n\nThen came the emotional phase of Abhimanyu suffering silently, seeing his ex-wife move on. It was heartbreaking. Like genuinely, I used to tear up watching that.  \nPeople say, “He divorced her, it’s been years, he should move on.”  \nSure, he *could’ve*, but love doesn’t work on timelines. His heart still beat for her, and seeing her happy elsewhere shattered him inside.\n\nThen the whole plot when Akshu came back into their lives in Udaipur  of course it was difficult for everyone. That chapter was left at such a dark point; her return brought back everything.  \nAnd then again, the same Arohi Abhimanyu wedding drama utter nonsense. Like how many times are we going to recycle this? If it was just for Roohi’s sake, they could’ve easily made him her legal guardian. Why the wedding again?\n\nThen the makers made Abhi cry every single day and it showed. You could literally see it on Harshad’s face, how mentally and physically drained the character and actor was. That entire post-revelation phase was painful to watch.\n\nAnd the way Akshu handled the Abhir revelation was also so poor. I get her fear that Abhi might take her son away, but that’s *his* child too the heartache was on both sides. And still, Abhi tried to keep both kids Roohi and Abhir  together, lovingly, calmly. That’s such beautiful maturity where he handled Roohi’s insecurity and possessiveness about sharing and caring.\n\nWhen he stayed at their vacation home he didn’t cross any line. He loved his son, respected Akshu, and was nice to Abhinav. Tell me, which ex-husband behaves like that? He wasn’t just being polite; he was genuinely kind to Abhinav, not out of guilt that he raised his son but out of decency.\n\nAnd honestly, 6 years Akshu never truly loved Abhinav. Suddenly, because of the Abhi drama, she started forcing that love narrative, but I always felt Abhinav was wronged emotionally. She could never reciprocate what he felt. He got a family, yes, but it always felt one-sided.\n\nAbhi helping in everything  from Muskaan’s wedding to supporting everyone just shows what a gem of a person he was.  \nHe accepted everything Akshu said about him, reflected, and *changed*.  \nThat’s real growth.\n\nThey say true love is when you’re happy in someone else’s happiness that’s literally Abhimanyu.  \nAkshu took away both his biggest dreams a happy loving couple and being the father he always wanted to be yet he never turned bitter.  \nHe could’ve been angry, vengeful, cruel even but he wasn’t. He handled everything with grace.\n\nMatlab seriously, who can hate Abhi after all this?\n\nThen came the confession he confessed his love again, only to be blamed and ridiculed for loving a “married woman.”  \nBut hello Akshara *knew* the truth about her so-called “marriage.” She herself said there was nothing between them and when she cried and ran after Abhi’s accident ?  \nSo why was Abhi villainised for expressing his emotions honestly?\n\nEvery single time, he was struggling between his family, Akshara’s family, and Abhir’s well-being yet he was the one who got blamed, insulted, and emotionally drained.  \nThen that birthday party he planned for Abhinav omg, who even does that?  \nThat’s how pure his heart was.\n\nThat “achha aadmi” only did one acha thing towards Abhi that was share Abhir’s Bachpan ka pics.Honestly, that “achha aadmi” tag if anyone deserved it, it was Abhimanyu.  \nWhat did he do wrong? Nothing except love too deeply, care too much.\n\nEven after everything, whenever someone disrespected Akshu in front of him, he would quietly take her side, defend her indirectly because he didn’t have that right anymore, yet his heart wouldn’t let him stay silent like that financial status part and Manjari shouting when Akshara and Abhinav got the matka for Pooja. \n\nAfter Abhinav’s death, Akshu could’ve behaved more maturely initially, considering she had seen what happened with Kairav. But at least she fought for Abhi later, which was commendable .   \nWhen they were about to get married again, I was 100% pro it because if anyone ever truly loved someone, it was Abhi.\n\nAkshu’s decision ki “ab bacha n bola to shaadi karlo” felt so wrong.  \nEven Arohi had a choice she could’ve done the same, but she didn’t.\n\nAnd I was honestly hoping that maybe, finally, the gift that was snatched from Abhi years ago of having a family, being a dad he could relive it again with Akshu and her new pregnancy.  \nBut no they had to ruin that too. \n\n**Arohi’s accident, the way they handled it, was ridiculous.**\n\nLike why make it such a trauma point for everyone? Roohi growing up thinking her masi killed her mom, Abhi dying with guilt what even was that?\n\nThey could’ve easily just called it an accident, kept the family together, let everyone heal. Her decision destroyed life of 3 kids she took away their life with a happy big family by separating .   \nAkshu went back into her “mahaan” mode, living a miserable life, dragging Abhira into pain the cycle repeating itself.And I’m pretty sure Abhi would have taken care of Roohi too if he wasnt dead but in those circumstances he couldn’t have left Akshara and Abhir .  \n\nIf I had a man like Abhimanyu in my life, I’d thank the gods every single day.  \nI’m not saying he was perfect but most of their problems arose because of *how* Akshu handled things.  \nIf you don’t behave like Akshu, you’ll never even see Abhi’s bad side. You will get a man who loves you to the moon and back , respects you and will fight the world for you . \n\nAnd even if we consider that yes, he made mistakes at least he owned up, learned, and moved forward.  \nHis bond with Arohi, Roohi, Akshu, Abhir  he fixed everything he could.  \nHe even stood up to his own mother in the end, supported Shefali, handled Shivu and Abhir’s fight so calmly he was great with all the kids and also as a doctor . \n\nTill his last breath, Abhi supported Akshara helped her with exam which she wanted to use against Abhi for custody, Muskaan’s wedding, Abhir’s custody even when he had no obligation to.  \nAnd also, people should stop comparing Abhinav and Abhi ,taking care of a random woman’s child when you have no family of your own is not the same as a man accepting his ex-wife’s baby with another man and still treating that child as his own.  \nThat’s on another level altogether.\n\n*Abhimanyu’s life was a storm of grief, betrayal, guilt, and heartbreak. But through it all, he loved fiercely, selflessly, unconditionally. He carried pain silently, stood for justice quietly, and always chose compassion over anger. His strength wasn’t loud; it was quiet, steady, enduring.*\n\n*To watch him was to witness the purest form of love: flawed, human, yet transcendent. Every struggle, every tear, every small act of kindness ,that was Dr. Abhimanyu Birla. And if you ever had a man like that in your life, you’d value that true love*.\n\n**Just my opinion. Ik it’s lengthy but that’s how you understand because this is what shaped the character and without reading the entire thing pls don’t fight with me I’m not justifying his action .** ",

    "content": "Smriti — she did just one serial, but what a serial. Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi wasn’t just popular — it was a movement. Her role as Tulsi became legendary. One show was enough to cement her legacy. That's rare.\n\nShweta — she’s done several shows, but Kasautii Zindagii Kay remains her standout moment. She’s one of the few who managed to balance a traditional look with bold screen presence — and that’s not easy. Even today, she has a loyal fanbase, especially for her glamorous and confident vibe (you know what I mean).\n\nSakshi — from Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii to Bade Achhe Lagte Hain, she’s had some strong roles and is among the few TV actresses who successfully transitioned to OTT platforms. Now, to be honest, she’s not known for being the most glamorous or for having a massive fan following. She’s not even on any social media. But the fact that people still remember her and respect her work speaks volumes. Sometimes, quiet impact is louder than hype.\n\nMy personal opinion? The real GOATs are Sakshi and Shweta. They’ve both sustained long, successful careers — Shweta is still active in TV, and Sakshi is doing some incredible work on OTT. To survive and stay relevant for so many years in this industry isn’t easy — but they’ve done it with grace and talent.\n\n\nAnd hey — Jennifer, Sanaya, Drashti, Ankita, Hina, Rupali fans — please don’t take this the wrong way or drop hate. This is just my opinion, and when someone says “GOAT of Indian TV,” these are the three names that instantly come to my mind. Everyone has their own list — this is mine.",

    "title": "'Dev purush' Paresh is one of the worst fathers in ITV",
    "content": "Paresh, this so-called “dev purush” in Udne Ki Aasha, has got to be one of the worst fathers in the history of Indian television. He’s double-faced, selfish, and toxic to the core. Everything wrong that’s happened to Sachin and Sailee starts with him. He sits back and lets them suffer just so he can protect his illusion of a united family and happy marriage.\n\nWhy doesn't he leave with Sachin when he knows exactly how badly he is treated? Why won’t he evict the upstairs tenants when his son and daughter-in-law are literally forced to sleep in the hall where anyone can walk in and out without shame? Why won’t he sleep there himself? He refuses to give SaChi their own room but the second it’s about Aakash or Tejas, he agrees without hesitation. The bias is disgusting. Why doesn't he make any effort to help them build a room?\n\nAnd the way he acts with Renuka is even worse. He gushes over her like she’s some goddess while she walks all over the people he claims to love. He actually let his own son take the blame for Tejas’ crime and go to juvie just to keep his wife happy. What kind of father does that? How do you look your child in the eye after ruining his life for your own comfort?\n\nRenuka is vile but at least she owns her hatred. Paresh is worse because he hides his venom behind that fake halo of kindness. And now they’re glorifying Renuka too, calling her a “caring mom” as if we’ve all forgotten the years of emotional abuse.\n\nEvery time this man is praised, I genuinely want to strangle  him. He’s the definition of useless. He preaches morals, praises Renuka for everything, and does absolutely nothing when his son and daughter-in-law are abused by her. There’s nothing good and godly about this man. He’s just a coward hiding behind his own hypocrisy who gets glorified everyday.\n\nI can bet he would literally do nothing to Tejas when the 27 lakh scam is exposed.\n",

He told her \"now I will see how you will survive in this city without my help\" \n\nThen few episodes later he has been trying to make her jealous by dancing with other girls. Then he started forcefully dancing with her, while she kept asking him to stop. \n\nThis physical and very rough push and pull was what was the most unpalatable to me when the show aired, with Geet being pregnant. Then years later I started focusing on some better aspects of the couple. But still when a scene like this comes I find it tough to digest. \n\n",

But still I am very interested to know about this one episode- so it's about the curse which falls on villagers due to some killing a naagin. Her naag hides and watched her getting killed and yeah some of their images as we know gets copied in his eyes. Which is okay now we have a protagonist here as well, a village girl whose father and brother also killed the nagin. So of course the naag kills them. But for some reason it starts chasing the mother and the daughter(protagonist too) like for no reason even though it had nothing to do with them. In the end after he dies, his soul is still haunting the girl because he had an unfulfilled wish since the girl when it's body was buried  had promised that she'll fulfill whatever it wants.\n\nGuess what 🥲 😭after haunting her as a ghost, it's found it has become a naag devta and wants to marry her. Yes marry her. In the end they're married. While I know this is illogical and makes no sense, as to why would a vengeful naag devta would want to marry a girl who's relatives killed his naagin? Whatever I did enjoy it though. ",

I find them a little underrated when it comes to be being talked about as a couple by the audience.\n\nI mean initially they both had no chemistry and then as the show went on they grew on me. I think a big part of why is because the director doesn't know how to direct their scenes properly. Well, until today's episode. They're always rushed and super G level.\n\nAnd thank God they came out of their G rated obsession. Keep it PG like how all the other shows are and also unhinged like how UKA originally was.\n\nAnd honestly lol did they change the writer or something because Udne Ki Aasha actually showing romance and not some weird prudish behaviour by the leads is a break through for them. This is probably the most romantic they have got. I literally expected them to give us Halloween track 2.0 in terms of plot and direction with the beach house track. Glad to see they aren't doing that.\n\n(p.s. it feels good to finally say something good about this show in again) ",

Every single episode feels like a struggle for them. It’s like everyone around them is a villain except maybe two or three decent people. It’s honestly painful to watch sometimes.\n\nAlso, I don’t get why the show portrays Indians and Hindus as super repressive or regressive. I feel like that’s just exaggerated for drama, right? Because no way real life is this bad for women. If it’s not, why are people not questioning such storylines? It’s honestly kinda embarrassing.\n\nThat being said,the chemistry between the main leads is amazing. They’re both really talented and beautiful. I just wish someone would cast them in a light-hearted, cute, feel-good romcom instead of all this misery.\n\nAny recommendations for shows like Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon on Hotstar? \n\nSomething romantic but not this heavy on drama and misogyny 😩",

    "content": "1. Tanisha Mehta (Vrinda) - Really good actress and I believe she (Vrinda) has the potential to carry the legacy of Tulsi, her first appearance was eye catching &amp; made me to watch the show but there's a problem. The screen time of Vrinda is really low coz of this audience can't connect to her and stop watching the show after Smriti's exit (acc to some sources, she will leave the show and come back when needed) and Vrinda's character is an innocent typie girl and Ekta will definitely made her a doormat in future. \n\n2. Rohit Suchanti (Angad) - I got influenced by some people on other SM platforms that he's not a good actor but after looking his acting myself I can say he's not that much bad as people say. But his look is just meh. Initially, his chemistry with Tanisha wasn't that much good but now it's increasing episode by episode.\n\n3. Aditi Sanwal (Mitali) - I saw her first in Deewani show &amp; she was damm good in that show. She's also doing really good in kyunki2 also &amp; Ig she will play the role of main vamp in Angad-Vrinda's life. Like her first appearance, all the expressions were so on point but ig Mitali's character going to irritate the audience a lot. Her character is bubbly but If she has given a sensible character she would have definitely steal the show from Vrinda imo.\n\n4. Aman Gandhi (Ritik) - Imo he's the best actor out of all the new cast and Ritik's character is also very sensible, green flag types and I'm just loving him. \n\n5. Prachi Singh (Munni) - She's also doing good imo but the makers are just focusing on that Pari instead of Munni &amp; Vrinda. Imo Munni-Ritik has much better chemistry &amp; storyline than that of Vrinda-Angad.\n\n6. Shagun Sharma (Pari) - We all know how good is she as an actor and has been discussed multiple times in this sub\n\nWhat's your thoughts?? ",

    "content": "Avantika Deewan was honestly one of the best written female characters on Star Plus in modern times. She was a divorcee living in her father’s house but unlike the usual portrayal of chhodi hui aurat types, she was anything but helpless. She stood beside her father and helped him build the Deewan empire from the ground up. A sharp, confident and strong headed businesswoman, she actually contributed way more to the business than her loser brother ever did.\n\nWhat i loved most about her was that she never gave up on her rights, even when her sister in law Sheela Deewan fought over property. Avantika lived her life with self respect and integrity. She had her differences with her husband, which got resolved later and though she didnt like Pankhuri at first, she eventually accepted her wholeheartedly. Honestly she felt more like the real lead of the show, the entire narrative rested on her shoulders. She was a true feminist in every sense, not because the script said so but because her actions showed it.\n\nThere are very few female characters on Star Plus who were written this well. Avantika easily ranks among the best, alongside Durga Thakur, Sakshi Goenka (even though she was negative, still an incredibly strong woman) and Draupadi.\n\nSo many ITV matriarchs just pretend to take charge of the house or business but it always feels fake and performative. Avantika was nothing like that, she was real, layered and inspiring. And honestly, Manasi Salvi deserves full credit for portraying her with so much grace and depth. Avantika Deewan will always remain one of the most iconic and powerful female characters of ITV.\n\n(insta cr: manasisthetics)\n\n\n",

Then he keeps saying Me kya galat kar raha hu, meri kya galti hai. I am totally with Aditi in this show. She is innocently getting dragged in toxic relationship. Sehri Babu is trynna have affair with Phool. Just get off her into another PG, why to bother your legal wife and lover (atleast claimed to be).\n\nReally such shows should start getting lowest TRP so makers know this storyline is not ethical at all. Shitty makers mind.\n\nPS: this hairstyle of Phool is like a cockroach.",

Kabir was the logical better choice and she tried to be a mature person n proceed with that. But Abhay was a storm that basically swept her away. I am glad though the triangle didn't last long..Kabir Piya relationship lasted even less than few weeks \n\nOn the other hand Kabir did fail to trust Piya and be with her when she needed the most,and also behave toxic at times later when he understood he has no chance with Piya at all, she's madly in love with Abhay.\n\nAbhay on the other hand I feel was the most mature one in the triangle .but it's his petty jealousy that made him provoke Piya to say yes to Kabir,🤣🤣\n\nIt ended in a wholesome way though with them becoming relatives. Abhay Piya becoming the jeeju saali of Misha Kabir ",

    "title": "Review on SPA 2025",
    "content": "If asked in one line then well this year's SPA is like *elaichiyo mein thoda sa biryani chidka dia*😏 Total nostalgia baiting but so cringeee. \n\nThe above posted clip part was the only good thing in SPA25 along with IshRa and SuShaan parts imo which hardly makes ~20mins out of the 4hrs episode lol. \n\n• Initially when they showed clips and posters of all their hit shows, my expectations went a bit high only to be disappointed with their content. They don't even make new title track or logo anymore and using the old ones since Covid. \n\n• I loved the part clip which I'm posting here. Such a nice use of technology! It really did look like Sachin went into the houses of these old shows! Whoever came up with this idea deserves a raise. Pratigya, DABH, etc.. I miss them all sm☹️ \n\n• Anupama alone had 4 dance performances, amongst which one was for more than 10 mins. As expected she hogged off most of the screenspace.😭\n\n• Mitti Akash from Sampurna didn't have any performance but Vishal Singh did idk why but anyway it was good tho. \n\n• In Krushna and kids segment, one child became havan kund and he told that every couple which got married in presence of it got seperated/divorced; and kiddo replied that then those leads got married with other people too so he's useful😭 Star Plus trolling its own shows.💀 \n\n• What's with the poor choreography? None of the dances were impressive (I expected much from IshRa but sad their potential went under utilized). Editing is too choppy. Silver Jubilee anniversary mein itna kanjoosi kaun karta hai bhai.🥴\n\n• Shivangi wasn't even called as Naira, let alone her appearing on stage. Why did they even call her if she was to be ignored lmao? Naitik ko bhi bas ek award ke liye bulaya tha. \n\n• Funny how all DKP shows actors had to mention Shahi🤣 That Devika actress almost exposed Shahi by telling if not for him she wouldn't have got an award. \n\n• Wonder why Smr*ti didn't arrive for the event. Is it because she feels superior of herself as she's an ex m*nister? Or did SP didn't agree to her Z+ sec*rity demands? \n\n• Mihir Pari overaction of PDA was totally cringe. The urge to switch the channel was so hard at that time. So was Abhira Arman Vidya Kaveri squad and Anupama squad. \n\n• Sorry not a fan of Kasauti Kyunki Kahani trio so Bajaj Prerna Komolika didn't interest me at all. But I must say Shweta was looking stunning.😍\n\n• Kanwar did really good hosting. He made it interesting and bearable. Reminded me of Kartik in 2018 SPA. \n\n• Watching Suhana Ishaan’s banter after so long made my heart so happy. All the flashbacks and ost as they walked together holding hands was nostalgic. They still share the same sweet chemistry even after so many years passed by.🩵\n\n• Raman saying Ishita is not a doctor was so funny and nostalgic bhai he used to say the same in the show too🫠 They looked gorgeous in blue together and despite the poor choreography their chemistry shined through. \n\n• I'm so done with Instagram Reels trends bruh. That Anupama's apko kya and that Rasoda mein kaun tha is so washed but they keep on using it till eternity. But Gopi giving back to Kokila was hilarious. Jo bhi kaho these old characters were the only saving grace of the event. \n\n• Saiyaara on Abhiman is an insult to Saiyaara🥴 None of the new couples had charm, and add to that the below average choppy choreography! \n\n• Overall, it's a below average event if you watched it for old characters and above average if you watched it for new characters. What's your opinion guys?  ",

But he couldn't hug her back, may be because he was so repressed or because at that moment he was so overwhelmed.\n\nWhen he came back home, he could obviously only think about her, and how every tear from her eyes was affecting him so much.

She was the one who pursued Sachin until she got him, and now she is so shy and scared every time they get any chance at being together. She should be jumping at every chance considering that she was initially really into him and they don't have a room, but the show is literally making her such a stereotypical so called 'sanskari' FL that has to be awkward every time, even after 2 years of marriage. \n\nMy problem with all the romance scenes are that they're so quick and rushed. None of them are properly shot while random, irrelevant scenes take so much time. It's infuriating. \n",

    "content": "I came across this reel on insta about IPKKND: EBP. Honestly i think IPK EBP was better than IPKKND1. It actually had a proper storyline, with the main theme addressing domestic violence against women. Aastha, the FL, had real backbone, she never gave in to anyone, whether it was her husband or her in laws. Every character had their own arc and each was explored thoughtfully. I really liked how the story unfolded over time. Overall the show was about confronting misogyny.\n\nInterestingly it was never meant to be a S2 of IPKKND. Star Plus, however, forced it into the IPK franchise. The original title was Dard-e-Dil and there are even unreleased promos online with that name. I also remember that it was initially intended to be a remake or inspired by English Vinglish, which is somewhat reflected in the mother in law’s storyline.\n\nThe one thing i didnt like was how easily the male characters got away with crimes they had committed over the years, especially that monstrous father in law.\n\nI actually loved IPKKND1 as well but i felt that S2 was more mature, even though the conclusion wasnt very satisfying. Also, the IPKKND title never really fit the main theme of S2.\n\nEdit: Oh and the plot twist about mother in law being the real victim of domestic violence was so well done. I really didnt see it coming until they showed how the father in law used to beat her and control the entire household through her, all while pretending to be the perfect, kind man in front of everyone.\n",

Idk why no one talks about it, like kya kuchh nahi hai iss show me. It has a strong FL, scary Vamps, great chemistry between leads, family drama, family values and it was one of the TRP topper shows of that time. Highest trp - 5.2, afair\n\nAfaik Abha wasn't a doormat, ik she was very idealistic and easily forgave the people who hurt her but it was one of the best parts of the show kyunki iski vajah se hum villians ko ek positive role me dekh paye unke hriday parivartan ke baad, like jis Shaili bhabhi se mai darti thi usse mai baad me dekh ke khush ho jati thi. \n\nThe best part of the show was Abha and her chemistry with Karan. Karan was a supporting ML afair &amp; Abha's character was really strong, the way she confronted the villains &amp; the way she exposed them, it was perfect. Abha was ideal person for me in my childhood. Her chemistry with Karan was magical, their romantic scenes used to give me butterflies, I just love them\n\nBut show ke end se pehle wale ek track (dr. se shaadi wali arc) ne show ko less engaging bna diya or show ki TRP gir gayi or off air ho gya. That arc single handedly ruined the whole show\n\nIg mai achhe se chijo ko explain nahi kar paayi but mere dil ki baate zubaan I mean type ho hi nahi pa rahi hai ",

Jugnoo even had a distinct theme music, which I’ve been humming since morning, but I can’t seem to find the episode anywhere online.\n\nDoes anyone else remember this character or know which episode this was?\n\n[Edit : It was Anokha Abhijeet]",

    "content": "I feel certain male roles in TV were made for certain TV actors. They immortalised those roles through their superb acting and performances For me :-\n\n1. Rajeev Khandelwal as Sujal Garewal in Kahin To Hoga - He portrayed it so well. His love, pain, jealousy, helplessness. Rajeev Khandelwal was made for that role. \n\n2. Rajat Tokas as Akbar in Jodha Akbar - His poise, grace as the Emperor. His brilliant performance was so so good. Whenever I think or read about Akbar , I think about Rajat Tokas.\n\n3. Mohit Raina as Shiv in Devon Ke Dev Mahadev - No other actor after him could do justice to the role like he did. \n\n4. Karanvir Bohra as Viraj Dobriyal in Saubhagyabati Bhava - He was so so good here.\n\n5. Adnan Khan as Viaan Raghuvanshi in Katha Ankahee - Viaan’s role was very different than other Male lead roles in ITV. Though the story was controversial , he did brilliantly. \n\nPlease others share your opinion. ",

My main question is Kartik-Naira never got divorced, she was just assumed to be dead, then how did Kartik and Vedika got married?

Rucha Hasabnis - Played Rashi in Saath Nibhana Saathiya 1 and made a powerful impact on the audience. She literally stole the show from Gopi Bahu but never made a comeback on TV after that. Saathiya fans miss her a lot\n\n 3. Rhea Sharma - Played the character of Mishti in 'Yeh Rishte Hai Pyaar Ke' and I really loved her, she also work in MS Dhoni: The Untold Story and was also fabulous in that. My eyes are waiting for your comeback. \n\n All the 3 actresses are consistently active on social media, so please bless our TV screens also. Remind me if I am forgetting someone else. ",

    "content": "I started watching this show because of recommendations on this subreddit.  \nNot gonna lie, I thoroughly enjoyed the first 100-110 episodes.  \nThe chemistry between AR, their romance, fun, angst, comedic timing, everything was perfect.\n\nI initially loved Arman and I also kinda knew that Riddhima was a snobby lovergirl, who at times mistreated Arman emotionally but that was kinda normal for any person who was in their 1st relationship. Riddhima was a nice girl in general, not to forget that Arman was also no lesser than a flirty manchild who always used to play pranks on others.\n\nBut here in this particular track, Arman helped out Muskan (Drashti Dhami) by pretending to be her boyfriend in front of her family without telling Ridz.   \nWhen she finally got to know about this, she had a valid crashout and instead of making up with her, Arman left Sanjivani thinking that it's over between them.\n\nRiddhima, like any lovergirl chased her loverboy to come back to Sanjivani for the sake of his career. He did. When Riddhima acted ignorant with Arman, He played a suicide prank on Riddhima and called her to the terrace.\n\nThis is what he did thereafter. Like seriously, Isn't this what we call manhandling and abuse?  \nAnd surprisingly, this isn't just the only time he manhandled her, Even in the further episodes,   \nHe proceeds to strengthfully grab her arms while arguing, punching the wall out of anger in front of her and what not.\n\nI know it's a TV show but if we all can love-hate ASR from IPKKND for being physically abusive to Khushi, then we shouldn't hail a Male Lead like Dr. Arman as a green flag too.\n\nHe was no way a green flag, Both Arman and Riddhima were toxic.   \nOne was the emotionally toxic one, Second was the physically toxic one.\n\n",

There yeah Pakhi behaves to be typical irritating frnd...like asking for a Chinese platter in a Dhaba... But still bro it's fine... We have seen men asking for fresh cooked meal even in trips..... But when a woman have the same demands of having a slight different meal, she is judged... Like she doesn't need to succumb to Anupama and Ba's eating choices... Right.... It's her stomach let her eat, if she falls sick she will manage... That time I don't think anyone of them would anything other than giving two more Tanes to Her... And then tolerating the smell of Gobar... Like why she has to.... Are women only women if she stops expressing any of her opinions, and just becomes a docile accepting doormat.... I don't like Gobar Or Gobar cakes because I have LPG at home...so do I need to feel guilty for not knowing how to use them...? No absolutely not.... Then,how Anupama criminalized Pakhi and Adhik's relationship.... And what we're her excuses that Pakhi was young... I understand.. But I very blurr line exists between concern and control and what she was doing with Palhi and Adhik' s relationship was control... Like not allowing Pakhi to accept Barkha' s gifts... Like why????... What morality are you questioning right now... Thenn when Rahi got married to Prem, she fully supported Rahi... And in what ways do you think Pakhi and Adhik' s marriage dynamics were different from Prem and Rahi' s marriage dynamics... Like Anupama's two brooke daughter getting married to Millionaires... Like how... Now don't say context, Rahi too didn't achieve anything academically... She just another Abhira, Akshu.... But somehow Rahi' s marriage is valid but Pakhi has done a crime... Wow... And there are many things I feel... Like not allowing Pakhi to go abroad or not investing at her business... Many things... I personally feel her relationship with Pakhi is just the visual representation of the reverse Oedipus complex... What do you think?? ",

He was such a piece of shit and abhi his mother is saying ki \"woh mann hi mann ghut raha hai\", \"uss galiyan hui hai par usse pachtava ho raha hai\", \"apne bachchon ke pita ko ek aur mauka do\", \"shaadi aaj hai, abhi hui toh nhi\"The mother in law is so so shit and to this Mangal's reply is \"Ma main aapke bina koi bhi kadam nhi le sakti\" Bhai apne khud ke baare mein soch na, woh Adit mother is thinking about her own son.\n\nThe worse thou out of all of these people is Mangal herself. That promo where Kapil is waiting in the Mandap and apparently usko darr lag raha hai. Bhai kya hai tu? What are you? How can you be so so stupid? You are getting such a good husband but nahi tujhe toh kachre ki hi aadat hai. Quoting a Taylor Swift lyric \"My brother used to call it eating out of the trash\".

He suited better with nayi sanam than the purani one.  \n\nSo, imo Shaad and Jannat had excellent chemistry. She looked amazing with him. Shaad was such a gentleman. And the way he used to look at her with that 'say it all eyes'.🤌🫠\nThey actually gave the atmosphere of Asad × Zoya. Their relationship did have the spirit of og couple. They could have been the end game if makers were a little bold. \nPeople loved aahil × sanam and I was okay with it too till the Shaad part.\nBecause she was sanam till she was with aahil. \n\nBut, the moment she became Shaad's Jannat, aahil's sanam stopped existing. \n\nTell me which one was your favourite??

    "content": "Sorry guys for second post on related topic but this is the serial I am watching with Kalash and now after rewatching after 12 years , I have started to feel it’s heavily problematic, biased and narrative driven \n\n1. Natasha is never even confronted by anyone for her abortion and Ayesha’s malfunction. The latter is a very questionable thing but it is pushed under the rug by Priya. Priya was very wrong there and should have prioritized her sister Ayesha instead of being diplomatic. \n\n2. When Ram and Priya reunite and grt together for second time, apparently Ram spikes Priyas drink which makes her out of senses and then she confesses everything. This is heavily problematic as Priyas complete consent in sense is not involved and is lowkey very questionable act by Ram, considering he married to Ayesha, even though the marriage made no sense since Priya was alive. But Priya herself decides to leave him and lets everyone believe that she is dead after listening to Ishika. So in a way, it is questionable and immoral especially spiking Priyas drink by Ram \n\n3. Pihu is literally worse than Siddhanth and Niharika once she grows up. She puts a false allegation on Varun leading to his passing away but is never questioned and Priya also hides that, very diplomatic. And the whole Sammy Suhani fiasco is because of her stupidest obsession to show Suhani she is an outsider, but Suhani is worst because she killed Sammy who tried to poison her sometime ago . Literally no one even asks Suhani if she is fine but everyone blames her. \n\n4. Ram is the stupidest dumbest character in later part because he also gives Pihu full support to marry Sammy even after multiple warnings of Priya. Later, when things go drown the drain he blames everyone but himself for the mistake. He played biggest role indirectly by giving Pihu 100% support to marry Sammy instead of stopping her and that lead to domino effect. Sammy did so much misbehavior with Suhani but he is only questioned when he does with Pihu \n\nHonestly, this show should not be called iconic , it was my favorite show but the narratives make me hate it now. Very very problematic and some evil characters are forgiven and some responsive characters are punished. Pihu and Siddhant are much more negative than Suhani and Ayesha respectively but both are forgiven . And Ram Kapoor character is highly problematic. For me now honestly the only likable characters are Suhani , Saumya and Krishna, who plays original mother of Ram. I don’t hate Ayesha but I don’t even like her since her actions post accident are miserable , when she was replaced . But overall , it’s a problematic show \n\nEdit :5 women get pregnant before marriage, Neha, Natasha, Ayesha, Janhavi and Suhani . Kartik had no other role but to just do this. I don’t want to sound like only woman are wrong but what on earth is this . 5 women in a single drama makes no sense only ",

    "content": "Watching Swaragini feels like running a marathon while someone screams ‘meri behen!’ in your ear.\n\nI’ve watched the first 85 episodes of Swaragini, and honestly, it feels like I’m hate-watching it at this point. The first 85 episodes of Swaragini prove chaos is a full-time job in that household. The show is such a high blood pressure ride — no one seems to have a single moment to relax. Every character is constantly on edge, yelling or overreacting, except for Sanskar and Dida, who are the only ones bringing any calm amidst all the chaos (well, and the occasional blast of loud background music).\n\nEven Swara managed to irritate me more than Ragini in the initial episodes. The characters get on my nerves so much that I actually find myself rooting for Sanskar, even during his so-called villain phase. At least he’s chill, direct, and unapologetically straightforward with his own lakshya and Ragini.\n\nLakshya, on the other hand, was completely thanda dull  and irritating with his immature behaviour until his confession scene with Swara. And don’t even get me started on Swara’s sudden realisation about him — one moment she’s all “Lakshya ne galti ki hai, wohi batayega,” doing her endless meri behen, meri behen chants, and the next, after one night and Lakshya’s jail stint, she flips her feelings entirely.\n\nAnd then there’s Lakshya’s father — the height of hypocrisy — what he did with Sanskar while happily announcing Lakshya and Swara’s relationship.\n\nAt this point, I think I’m hate watching Swaragini purely for Sanskar ( though he is a villain doing all shit is still having better screen presence) and may be Dida(in coma now though) till my patience lasts.",

    "content": "Where do I even begin? I used to adore Sachin. He was literally my favorite. Kanwar had him down perfectly. But now I can barely stand watching him. The writers have completely butchered his character. He’s gone from street-smart and intense to just gawar and unbearable. There’s zero charm left. Even Kanwar’s acting isn’t helping. The overacting is so bad, especially in the “funny” scenes. It’s not funny; it’s secondhand embarrassment. Someone needs to tell Kanwar to watch himself in any episode between 1 to 200 and then watch himself now. There is clearly a big difference.\n\nAnd seriously, what’s with turning Sachin into this sad, self-pitying mess? He used to be strong, tough on the outside and vulnerable inside. Now he’s just clingy, crying every two episodes, and depending on Sailee for everything. Where’s his self-respect? This is the same man who once ruled the house, and now he’s reduced to asking for Sailee’s permission to breathe.\n\nSailee, for all her flaws, at least has some direction. She’s working, doing something with her life. Sachin just taunts people while being completely useless himself. The downgrade is insane. From an unpolished but magnetic guy to a complete cartoon.\n\nI’m not hating for the sake of it. I’m frustrated. This was the character that could’ve carried the whole show. Instead, they’ve turned him into another mahaan, spineless lead with no edge or personality left. Bring back his bite. Bring back his fire. Stop making him pathetic.\n\n",

It was all absolutely horrible. Like HORRIBLE !!!! Shivaay was a toxic manchild character who took random decisions to save his unhinged family like force marriage Anika and they treating Anika like shit and what not. He never had a proper character development. Anika herself was so badly written as FL, she started off as one of the most bold FLs from Gul and ended up being one of the weakest ones. She was such a doormat living under the shadow of a man like Shivaay who treated her so badly. All of these problematic things were shown to us (as teenagers) under the garb of melodious OSTs and songs. 🌚🌚\n\n\nGlorification of toxic romantic relationships were like the core part of the show. Not just, Shivika, even Rikara and Ruvya were equally toxic, Tej-Jhanvi were a horrible duo and despite so much torture Jhanvi never divorced Tej. Pinky was horrible woman and a mother in law who not only tortured Anika but did so dirty with Shivaay's legitimacy as well. Despite that the way all of them lived under the one roof was laughable. And then the villains were so caricaturish - Svetlana and Roop were just cartoons. Svetlana's revenge track was simply unserious. 🤡🤡\n\n\nAnd in the name of experiment the kind of torture Gul did on viewers, no wonder Ishqbaaaz fans still hate her till today (including me). The whole redux track was godawful. All the characters were 2x worse in this whole redux. I can never forget how Shivaay forcibly married Anika and called her \"mistress\". Ewww. And even after this, Anika never had one inch of hate for him. She was busy in winning his heart (awww). Just pathetic. And how can i forget that weird murder nystery with Mandana Karimi, the disgusting 5 year leap and the way everything was abruptly ended making a way for another disastrous new Gen2 about which i dont know anything so i wont talk either lol. \n\n\nAnd we all know about the terrible \"table cloth\" fashion standards of the show. 😂\n\n\nSeriously this embarrases me till date that how madly obsessed i was with this show which was a celebration of glorified toxic relationships. Minus, the bromance between ShivOmRu, everything was so cringe !!!!! 😵\n\n\nNow tell yours.",

    "content": "I've been holding this for a while finally got time to rant over it, I honestly feel Roshni gets way too much unnecessary hate and trolling on x, insta, youtube and here as well. Yes, she isn’t perfect or like an idealized ITV heroine, but she is definitely not a villain either. Many times, we have seen her feel genuinely bad for Sayli. For example, when her mother did not allow Sayli to meet Krish, Roshni was clearly uncomfortable and felt bad for her.\n\nShe has also been kind to Sayli several times. She genuinely appreciates her cooking, congratulates her when she gets floral orders, and jist a few days ago when Sachin’s friend was teasing Sayli she seem to be concerned for her. These small gestures show that she has a heart and a conscience.\n\nThis is exactly where Roshni stands out from typical ITV vamps. She does not go around plotting murders, frame people, doing EMAs or destroy lives just to get what she wants. Unlike over-the-top villains who have no limits, Roshni feels guilt and has boundaries. Her actions come from fear and insecurity, not from hatred or cruelty.\n\nFor a moment if we forget the lies she told to Deshmukhs about Krish and her father, Roshni actually appears to be a very realistic and relatable character. She is grey, emotional, and flawed but not heartless. I also do not think she was wrong for hiding Krish’s truth. It was not her fault; her mother forced her into marriage with an older man. She knows the Deshmukhs would not have accepted her truth. Paresh might have, but Tejas and Renu would never. In fact, Renu would have treated her even worse than she treats Sayli.\n\nRoshni is not evil. She is a woman stuck in unfair circumstances, trying to survive and protect herself. That makes her more human, more layered, and much better written than many so-called villains in television shows.",

Just a wild thought struck me - There was a serial named Mrs Pammi Pyarelal where Gaurav Gera took on the disguise of a woman followed by hilarious outcomes. That serial should be rebooted with Sugandha Mishra where she gets into a male getup followed by hilarious situations (including woman falling in love with her male persona).

The leads have no self respect and are quite hypocritical to be honest. They always preach about doing the right thing but they can't even do right to themselves. They treat Renuka like some devi, especially Sailee. And Sachin? He's overhyped. He's not actually a great husband like the show is trying to force on us. He would've been great had he actually took a serious stand and decided that it was enough of subjecting his wife to his toxic family. Instead, he justifies it by saying that he can't leave his dad. Like dude just shift in a place close by.  Why is he turned into a goody two shoes simp who has no life outside of being mahaan and being a yes man to his family? He used to be so muphat and mean, and now he's so cringe. His dialogues and extra gawarpan sucks big time now. It's actually irritating.\n\nThe taxi business that he wanted to create? It's been made into a total joke. One day he talks about it and next day he forgets. Where is the business mind? Honestly, how can he do business when all he does is sell his taxi or take up some loan the first chance he gets? Literally, he does it only to be mahaan. And Sailee has to be some angel that comes to save the day by buying his taxi back.\n\nWhy do we need to watch 2 extremely mahaan characters? Sailee is turned into a typical itv FL but why Sachin? At least let him keep his rugged badboy persona who doesn't think twice before saying something nasty and is streetsmart. I remember he used to call Roshni bikharan and it was hilarious. He didn't hesitate to stoop low. And the time he accidentally slapped her? LMFAO. He used to be so intimidating and had mic drop moments. There were times when Sailee even hesitated to say things to him.\n\nHonestly, UKA used to be so unhinged and took so many risks. It has regressed so much now. And I hate how they have made Sachin into an actually gawar person. The way he talks and behaves is abnormal, cringe, and so so OTT. Why did they make his character so cringe?\n\nAnd Sailee dude what's with the mangalsutra thing? She didn't wear it for 2 days. They could've at least put in a dialogue that it broke. And honestly I wanted to watch the Anant track but with her mangalsutra returning they made it illogical and so random. What's the point of introducing Anant when he's not going to lead to any plot. Koi jealousy koi issue nahi. He's just there trying to woo Sailee and he's harmless so what's the point of introducing him? it's so random and unnessarcy. The chandu track was better than this.\n\n",

    "content": "Whenever I think of Pavitra Rishta, I honestly feel that Satish Deshpande and Ashna Kirloskar never got the credit they deserved.\n\nSatish was the calm voice everyone needed. Even when Varsha’s impulsive decisions and later her obsession with Soham created chaos, he never lost his dignity. He didn’t raise his voice, didn’t belittle her—he guided her with patience and balance. In a show full of anger and misunderstandings, he stood out as one of the most mature and sensible men ITV has ever shown.\n\nAshna, on the other hand, was the very definition of grace. Unlike most rich characters on TV, she wasn’t arrogant or manipulative. She supported DK, gave Arjun the freedom to follow his heart, and treated Archana and Purvi with genuine warmth. She valued relationships more than status and carried herself with dignity right until her tragic exit.\n\nTogether, Satish and Ashna acted like the bridge that often brought Manav and Archana closer when everything else was pulling them apart. For me, they remain two of the most realistic and straightforward characters in the entire show, and honestly, in all of ITV.",

And i found dadi v annoying....like she just wanted everything to be of her convinience-when shivaay and annika got seperated and both were marrying someone else(just to clear no one knew the truth why it was happening) dadi kept on saying annika and shivaay are meant together even tho it was an act from annika and shivaays side if it was not thats just mean. Also all the girls had so horrible back stories like couldnt one of them be normal?? And not to to mention all the girls were such saints. And priyanka was just gone suddenly... also who tf was maintaining their empire? Shivaay used to be busy in his romance , om is an artist (the only one who actually worked) and rudra well was there. Tej was busy with svetlana. Shakti was also at house most of the times. And all ladies except bhavya were housewives. Sometimes for plot convinience shivaay only used to go to meeting and obv the mandatory calls but never have i seen him actually in the company. And i got so annoyed with repeated seperation of annika and shivaay. But all the storylines involving svetlana were quite amazing. Overall id give it a 7/10. \n\nIm on s9 btw.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

    "content": "I was rewatching the dhaba episode in ipkknd and I always thought the dhaba owner couple was so cute and good hearted. Then I remembered the wife of Rudra's boss in rangrasiya and how she is my fav one-off cupid characters from any tv show - elegant, generous, sweet but also fun.\n\nWho are your fav characters from this category? They don't necessarily have to be cupids for the main couple.\n\n",
