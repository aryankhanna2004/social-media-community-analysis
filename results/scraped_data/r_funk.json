    "content": "Of course, \"loose\" funk already existed and you can hear the influence of songs like \"P Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up\" (Parliament), \"Africa Talks To You\" (Sly &amp; The Family Stone), \"Maybe Your Baby\" (Stevie Wonder) and \"Players Balling\" (Ohio Players) - not in the interpolation aspect, but in that loose rhythm aspect - in Playa Playa, his most influential song when it comes to funk, I mean, a lot of records came directly from this song like \"Hardgroove\" by RH Factor, \"Me Estas Haciendo Mal\" from Vinocio, \"No Beginning no End\" from José James, etc. But you can see there's a difference from this song to all of the songs that influenced it cited prior. \n\nBut Sugah Daddy, Back To The Future 1&amp;2, Chicken Grease, the clavinet playing on Playa Playa (so fucking behind both the mix and the beat, yet so funky) and Feel Like Makin' Love ...? I mean, I could be wrong but that's some brand new funk (based on the loosiest joints in funk history). I also don't see a lot of similarities between his funk and Prince's funk... i think Prince is more like tight grooves. what do you think about it?",

I thought I’d give it its own post and see if someone can answer what I got nothin on:\n\n  About this album, but considering a topic other than music : I’ve always wondered WHO was (or ‘’were’’) the designer(s) of the clothes they wore on the album cover; ‘cause the stuff they were is very stylish and has that typical 1980s class, whether casual or more dressed up !   I tried to find here and there, but couldn’t find any information about this, even on the inner sleeve that’s usually inside the album (as far as vinyls are concerned) … While on most other albums, you find that kind of information; for instance, on the next one (‘’Knight of the Sound Table’’), it was ‘’Boss’’ (Hugo Boss) and ‘’Armani’’ (Giorgio Armani); on ‘’Word Up !’’ from 1986 (where Larry Blackmon started sporting that DISGUSTING 😝 red ‘’codpiece’’ …), the designer of their new style of clothing was Jean-Paul Gaultier …   Even though this thread obviously focuses on music, I thought that style  - in terms of clothing -  was also part of 1980s funk, almost as much as music was; so : if ever anyone is a connoisseur and has informations about the designer(s) of the stuff that Cameo former members wore on the ‘’Feel Me’’ album, I’ll take it !                                🙏🏻",

    "content": "Been obsessed with this heater of a track by them called “Can We Try Love Again?”  It’s a gem of a deep soul/funk cut and the drummers pocket and feel is just ridiculously good. On Spotify they have like 4 tracks available. Surely there must be a full record or two out there to pick up? They’re such a tight soulful band it would be a shame if there wasn’t. Anyone have any of their records or know where I could pick them up? Cheers!",

Off the top of my head, and in no particular order, these were:\n\nBlack Water Gold – African Music Machine\n\nYou Know You Got Soul – Bobby Byrd\n\nGot to Get Your Own – Reuben Wilson\n\nCross the Tracks – Maceo and the Macks\n\nJust Kissed My Baby – The Meters\n\nThink – Lynn Collins\n\nCharles Wright – Express Yourself\n\nFunky President – James Brown\n\nMind Power – James Brown\n\nGatur Bait – The Gaturs\n\nHercules – Aaron Neville\n\nFug – Cymande\n\nMore Peas – The JBs\n\nOne Nation Under A Groove – Funkadelic\n\nAshley's Roachclip – The Soul Searchers\n\nNT (No Title) – Kool &amp; The Gang\n\nO'Donel Levy – Bad, Bad Simba\n\nWhat would you add to this list? I'm sure there are a fair few I've forgotten, but these are the ones that spring immediately to mind. Of course, there may also be ones I’m not aware of, so please suggest away!",

    "title": "War - War (1971)",
    "content": "There was a band out of Compton in the 1960s that went by the Creators. I’ve seen it stylized “The Compton Creators” and I prefer it that way. They were started in ‘62 by guitarist Howard Scott and drummer Harold Brown but quickly they solidified a lineup that included Thomas “Papa Dee” Allen on percussion, Charles Miller on sax, B.B. Dickerson on bass, Lee Oskar on harmonica, and Lonnie Jordan on keys and vocals. Together these cats created insane rhythmic rock and R&amp;B that echoed (even surpassed) their neighbors to the north, Santana. But it wouldn’t be until they were approached by ex-Animals (“House of the Rising Sun”) singer Eric Burdon and his manager to rebrand as “Eric Burdon and War” that they took off, really.  And I don’t know how I feel about that. Something seems off about the arrangement every time I real about it. The arrangement. \n\nBut they killed, man. “Spill the Wine” is a blues, psych rock banger. They got big in the London scene especially, jamming with Jimi Hendrix 1970 just as Jimi was getting turned onto Funk. They dropped a second album, *Black-Man’s Burdon*, in 1970. And now I don’t know how I feel about that either... But on the tour in support of the album, Burdon had an asthma attack on stage. The band continued gigs without him. Burdon quit the band. They finished the tour, came home, and dropped this, their debut, self-titled album: *War*. \n\nAnd just like that. That matter-of-fact. Let’s go then. What I love about this album is how much it previews where the band’s sound will peak in the middle of the decade but it’s almost surprising where the roots are, you know? \n\nThere’s plenty of jazz on this, for one. The opener, “Sun Oh Son” comes in heavy on the instrumental, real wide on the guitar, the backing vocals, and breathy under a real pretty harmonica riff and then a solo flute (Charles Miller). There’s plenty of blues there too, rock even. The chorus on this track is iconic, maybe despite—maybe because, even—B. B. Dickerson’s lead vocal. Man. That steady, driving snare under it too. That’s where you start to see the Funk, and start maybe to get a hold of what makes War, War. War is not a Funk band here. Here, they’re a blues band. A rock band. And psychedelic R&amp;B band. And in all those modes they bring heavy, Funk-infused rhythms. On “Sun On Sun” it’s that Harold Brown, Papa Dee percussion duo. Driving down in the riff, the huge block hit on “shotgun.” That bass rumbles, man. Heavy. And that big low end becomes a staple. That big low end sets the tone. \n\nIn “Lonely Feeling,” we get a chirpy piano at the top but then quickly again B. B. coming in big and low and driving the blues into the ground with nothing but a tambourine egging him on. And it’s almost nothing but bass, clicks, and Lonnie’s voice for a good chunk of the track. For a split second it’s nothing but those clicks in the break. But there’s a stomp in that piano too, driving, man. At some point you catch that twang in the guitar, real low down blues. Lonnie’s vocals match it perfect. He’s got somethin to say. He’s got to say it now. He’s got that lonely feeling. Make it gospel. Kill the track. \n\nThe a-side closes with a ballad, “Back Home.” Still on the big low-end but now there’s more melody in Miller’s sax, in the keys and the guitar especially, that bring that soulfulness to the table. You’ll hear it echoed in the lead vocal, and that’s Miller too this time. And you hear it especially in Lonnie’s organ and piano. The slide in, that heavenly, wide lane he kicks in in the chorus. That against the sparse chop of the guitar. That riff. What a pretty track, man. Almost too pretty. But Miller gives himself a wide edge to sprinkle some grit on and he does. He can wail. He can breathe for ya. Man can sing for real. And that sax solo, a little modern, a little bluesy, a little smooth and lost in the sauce of that organ. It’s an easy track to get lost it. It feels a little like that’s the point. The airiness in the sax at the close accents it, too. Sink in. \n\nB-side. “War Drums” gives us whiplash, showing us just how wild the War percussionists will take it by mid decade. Papa Dee cooks here. From the jump. We ain’t back home no more. Shaking in. Horn stabs. Then a drum punctuated ev er y syll a ble. You just gotta dig in on it. Tense. Catch the jazz in the sax solo. It’s got a bop. The organ giving it a little room to jump, to stray and come back. And then? One. Two. Three. Break. I love that percussion break. Papa on the congas. Every down beat explodes man. Every one can get a roll. A hit. A drop. Then that big roll out, with the organ. And DROP back in. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. And the flute. I side eye this track. It’s weird, man. \n\nConversely, “Vibeka” kills me. Straight up. I fall into that groove on the first beat. We’re on a proggier, funkier kick than most of the album here, but it’s still lush in the chord changes. Romantic like. Lonnie and B. B. bring all the funk here. Harold crashes just enough to make it heavy. And the sax, the harp, just blow right through it. Float on. I love that little riff though, it carries the rhythm in a real way, letting the percussion drag just a bit without getting sloppy. It’s a cool move, man, reminds us why they’re the best to do it. But I also love this track for the harmonica solo. We don’t get a ton of it on this album generally, but seeing that piece come in big on this track sort of previews some of the big War tracks to come. “Low Rider,” for one. And the guitar gets the same treatment, being one of the lone places it’s highlighted. Another chill, bluesy moment, but it builds in a way with some splashy drums that gives it one more dimension. The crescendo, the drop into the riff, the horn line back. And from there we build on it, build wide, more big chords, more layers, those wild organ slides, shiiiiiiiiit man you don’t expect this one to go this big now... take a long fade-out. Let the bass carry us out. \n\nAnd finally, “Fidel’s Fantasy.” WAKE UP, FIDEL. This is my shit. I’ve been obsessed with this one for a minute. From the jump, that deep-in-the mix guitar, the mess of cymbals. WAKE UP. A chime. A laugh in echo. It’s as cinematic as anything in their discography. It tells us a story of temptation, regret, liberation, and loss. It’s an uncharacteristically guitar-driven track, but it’s also the lone Latin standout. Remember the nights in the sugarcane, Fidel, huh? Where is Ana now, Fidel? The piano hits, Papa on the hand drums, it’s big, dramatic, but always rhythmic. A full switch up into a bass transition, new piano tones, none of it out of place. There’s an underlying, felt rhythm in this that overrides everything. No two pieces seem to match. But every piece needs all the others anyway. Down to the flute, almost too deep, blowing along with some piano chords. Then the flute is just somewhere else in a new verse. There’s a guiro on it. Not from the thoughts of Mao or the writings of stodgy men like Lenin and Trotsky, but the fables of Aesop, Grimm, and Hans Christian Anderson. Weird shit. Beautiful shit. \n\nThe breaks as a result vibe more than groove. At any point we can have vocals voiced over. Another flute kick. The piano ends up chugging along more than any other piece here. And it’s steady quarters underneath. Papa Dee bringing color. We’re left with damn near twelve minutes of Latin-esque, damn-near-samba, blues-infused, jam-based jazz interspersed with some wild, political, paranormal commentary. Do you know what’s waiting for you in the world of reality? \n\nSo go on. Your fantasy’s ending. Dig it. I must go, Fidel. Good bye for now. Good bye, Fidel. Good bye.",

    "title": "Parliament - Motor Booty Affair (1978)",
    "content": "Have you seen the music video for George Clinton’s “Atomic Dog”? It’s a scatalogical fever dream. I think there’s a basic man-pursues-woman plot to it but it’s mostly impressionistic character vamps in an industrial.... dog-pound-themed club-slash-arcade? Uncle Jam has a science lab in it, whatever the building’s primary use is. And as the camera sort of just lets this scene unfold, cartoon dogs, stylized usually as video game graphics, are sort of randomly imposed on the screen. It sounds bizarre right? I’ll link it. \n\nI bring this up because Overton Lloyd won some recognition for those graphics, and they became another trend set by Lloyd throughout 80s visual design. And indeed Overton Lloyd has put out tons of iconic designs for the P-Funk collective. His comic came in the early issues of *Funkentelechy*, making his Sir Nose the canon image. He did *Gloryhallastoopid*, the Funky. He did some of the first cartoon images of Bootsy on the Rubber Band albums. And most iconically he did this one, *Motor Booty Affair*. And it is iconic, man. The Sir Nose scene on the cover in that quick-scribble style. The profusion of mermaid booty. And the characters! The pop-outs! Queen Freakaleen. P-Nut Booty Jellyfish. Octave Pussy. And our man on roller skates and a yo-yo, back on the scene! How ya’ll doin’? Mr. Wiggles the Worm. \n\nLet’s go then.  From the ocean comes a notion that the real eyes lies in rhythm and the rhythm of vision is a dancer.  We start there. We start with the warning that this is not your average 50-yard dash of funk. We start with “Mr. Wiggles,” maybe the swingin’-est track in the P-Funk discography. It’s all on that clicky hi-hat, walking steady. The guitar (Michael Hampton) and Bernie’s synths  are it feel expansive and out-there but it’s kept tight under George’s character-building rap. It’s a big welcome to Bimini Road, Downtown Atlantis, all paced, really, by the bouncy, walking bass of Cordell Mosson. Steady. Tip-toeing in it. Giving the synth and the backing vocals something to wiggle on. Cordell holds it down here and, really, the bass holds it down in every track. Brings something fresh in each cut. And no wonder, such a bass heavy album is gonna feature six different bassists across 8 tracks. \n\nAfter Cordell we get a Bootsy cut. “Rumpofsteelskin.” You know him. He’s got dynamite sticks by the megaton in his butt. And Bootsy’s got something to say on this one. He comes in with that big, fuzzy deep end, commanding the track. He’s got the bass and the drums heavy on the one but he’s almost cutting up the melody with the bass line. On occasion he tosses a little slide in, like a reset to remind us that this is that rock-tinged, big Fonk Bootsy is known to bring. The bridge in there shows us a soul counterpart that just makes the big one-hits all the more satisfying on the way out. The wide synths across the track, the big effects, the vocals, the rap, the horns sort of sliding through each other, weaving together. That bigger break toward the close lays it all bare: a big, steady Bootsy groove with a mess of slippery keys, guitars, horns, synths giving a big, deep landscape for us to vibe on. \n\nRange off the jump, right? But this next one, the Junie track, takes it about as wide as you can go. Dig into this one. “(You’re a Fish and I’m a) Water Sign.” Oh shit now. The whole track is Junie and the Horny Horns, except for George and thirty other funkateers give the biggest choral back-up imaginable. That staggering, nervous guitar lick at the open. The swagger on the keys. That deep, deep baritone down in the backing chorus. And Junie gives it to us channeling his Ohio Player days. That yarl. He can’t stand it no more. Junie’s drums swing in and land heavy. Over and over. He’s feeling a little bit better than fine, girl. It’s a wide, soulful, too-heavy groove. So heavy on the low end. And Junie is here dropping it on us. Damn, man. \n\nJunie and Bootsy double up on bass duty with the closer, too. “Deep.” It’s a danceable track for real, giving a little preview of the kind of wiggly bounce the P is gonna bring to the late work. And Bootsy brings that wiggle for real, coupled with Junie’s synth, the heavy foot on the bass drum, it’s got a wide low end that goes wet, fully submerged in the bridge. It’s a cool vibe, the Sir Nose voice shouting “Deep!” against such a wide bass is cartoonish. The female backing vocals over the groove are luxurious. It’s a whole party and Junie’s conducting it from the clavinet, ya’ll. Wild conversation unfolds. It’s like you’re disoriented, floating through the party, and somewhere deep background with the horns, there’s a track there to latch on to. It’s just big you can’t see it, man. Fully in the groove. In the late breaks you’re fully with Bootsy on that lick too. The man is steady on the groove. This might be my favorite Parliament closer, man. \n\nBut the big single here, no doubt, is “Aqua Boogie.” Or, and I’ll only type this once, “Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop.” It’s their last mega hit and one of my favorites. The rhythm section here is the best of what P-Funk is offering into the 80s. The hand claps, the heavy foot on the kick, the digital low-end walking up to the One. That real tinny, real sparse guitar. It’s a groove man and that’s Bernie on the synths, including the bass line. And Bernie carries it with that low end. Into the chorus it’s all him. Through the breaks he’s holding it steady. In the other hand it’s all synth wiggle, big effects, bubbling up alongside Catfish snapping that guitar lick, Bernie is recording damn near ten different synths and keyboards on this. Going off. And the... pterodactyl? Wild shit. Wild, wild shit. Props to Catfish for giving the counterbalance on it. Love the way that dude builds out the pocket. \n\nThe open to the b-side, “One of Those Funky Thangs,” puts Tony Green on the bass. Only time I’ve ever seen this name. Dude can hit a pocket deep in the mix though. It’s classic funk. The closest to the 50-yard dash we were told we don’t want (but dig here nonetheless for real). Bernie’s synth builds out the low end again pretty big. The horny horns get some room to shine with it, and the range of wild effects—slide whistles, someone doing virtuosic shit on a triangle, cartoonish shit in the backing vocals we all love—elevates it here when it could work against it. The wide synth chords, the chimes, the triangle, the whistle, it’s all part of the party the Horny Horns are at the center of. And they own the breaks to prove it. \n\nBut damn this here is my jam: “Liquid Sunshine.” Gary Shider, crazy underrated as a front man. Bernie once again holding down bass duty on the synths. Bringing more wiggle than your average worm, but hitting it precise too. That precision is dope, complemented by Mudbone’s drum, that driving snare, and the cut through of the backing vocal: “Shine! Sun shine...” There’s a digital, wiggle effect in the back that kills me every time, just seems so counter to the chorus vocal. It’s weird dude. Real weird and real cool. A bit of a spacey dimension around a punchy bass line. And late in the track, that near-outro, that little bridge, the “no more teachers,” Bernie’s bass hand goes into overdrive. Something in the tone softens it all just a pinch, but it’s urgent too. Something uncanny in the track man, maybe dark even. I can’t put my finger on it. A laziness, a summer weekend laziness, but the backdrop to it is manic. I love the vibe. And Garry’s rising guitar late in the track reminds you just how wide and how deep the vibe is. I dig it heavy and I hope y’all do too. \n\nThat leaves the title track. Yet another Junie feature right before the closing Junie feature. We got Junie on the lead vocal, George close behind though, weaving these vocals together in this hypnotic drone. Skeet Curtis hitting a bubbly bass now—most bubbly line here I think—that’s the piece that keeps it from getting real sludgey with the vocal effect. Those high pops almost skip, man. He’s got a little boogie in it too. A good danceable edge it in, Tyrone Lampkin helping hold that down with a steady play between the kick and the hi hat. And all that gets cut right down with that Garry Shider riff. A simple little progression but just enough again to break out of the deep, man. And that’s what it is here and across this whole album, you come to realize. This is the down to earth P, the aquatic, primordial P, not far out or super spiritualized. It’s wet funk, deep funk, real deep, real low grooves from top to bottom. That walking swing jazz goes deep. The Bootsy/Junie grooves go deep and wide. And even as this title track comes to a close it’s the steadiness in the bass, not walking but just about strutting, that gives it meat. \n\nSo go on and let’s raise Atlantis to the top with the bump and the bop! May I have this swim?",

It’s not a “kinda similar” thing — it’s the exact riff, transplanted as a nod to the Godfather.\n\n2️⃣ P-Funk Lyric Shout-Out – At 6:42, Prince sings “Like George said, let’s get satisfied, let’s get satisfied.” That’s straight from George Clinton’s Get Satisfied off the 1993 album Hey Man… Smell My Finger. Direct homage to George himself.\n\nPrince literally stitches James → George → Prince into one 10-minute funk odyssey. The funk family tree in one song.\n\nIf you know, you know. \nNow you know. 🕺🎷🎤\n\nListen here:\nThe Exodus Has Begun\nhttps://moonbeamlevels4u.info/the_exodus_has_begun.htm\n\nGet On The Good Foot\nhttps://youtu.be/5v6UtquMQNE?si=03e_mjGLPfJxpRTv\n\nGet Satisfied\nhttps://youtu.be/I2d423JLYlA?si=UOqDCRV_pKitM-cE\n\nHad to share 😃",

You know that moment when an album switches from huh to whah? It’s been a week now and I’ve been listening to Riot non-stop. Holy shit!!! It is so bloody messy in an amazing way. I now “get it”.

    "title": "Billy Cobham - A Funky Thide Of Sings (1975)",
    "content": "Panamanian-born, Brooklyn-raised, jazz-funk drum icon Billy Cobham. That’s who we’re about today. I wrote about him before in the Grover Washington post because Billy introduced the jazz scene to Grover through his CTI/Kudu connects specifically. But Billy was carving out his own space, obviously. See, after his stint in the Army (he was drafted in ‘65 and played in the Army band for a minute), Billy went and sat in on some iconic situations. He played with Horace Silver, did time as a house drummer for Atlantic and a session player for CTI/Kudu. He played on *Soul Box* with Grover, *White Rabbit* by George Benson—I love that album. And then eventually he’s part of Miles Davis’s funk turn. He’s on the *Jack Johnson* album, for one. Then, John McLaughlin picks Billy up and they do iconic jazz-rock-funk fusion work with the Mahavishnu Orchestra. The jazz pedigree is fully built, man. And it’s a musical lineage I adore. Herbie intersects here. Bob James. Two steps from Jaco and Chick Corea. Stan Clarke. \n\nBut there’s something else at play that’s less about jazz pedigree and more about being big, flashy. Damn right Funky. And like other Funk greats, Billy is building monstrous equipment to get monstrous sound from. Throughout his career, he’s innovating the kit itself, playing the first electric kits in the early 80s, rocking custom, dual bass drums, then a triple bass drum with three linked pedals. He’s getting custom drums built out of different kinds of fiberglass. He’s playing a kit with three different snares. Three-foot fuckin’ gongs. Far out.\n\nThose far-out tendencies, the tendencies that shape the jazz-funk legend of Billy Cobham, were obvious probably from the jump but most definitely by the release of his debut, solo album: 1973’s *Spectrum*. Immediately hit #1 on the jazz chart. A bomb hit the jazz world and Billy kept experimenting, kept growing his kit and his reach through the 70s, perhaps hitting his most lasting, most famous, move beloved note in 1975’s *A Funky Thide of Sings*. \n\nThe album opens with a second of deep, percussive low notes. A single hi hat splash and then—boom. Massive, cinematic brass. That’s Michael Brecker on saxes, Randy Brecker on trumpet, and Glenn Farris on trombone. And the brass is cool, putting in work and all, but it’s what underneath that grabs you. Billy’s almost riding the upstroke most of the song, and the bass line (Alex Blake) has a little bubble. A little stagger to it. Coupled with the synth and really complemented by the lazy guitar. The while rhythm is splashy more than syncopated. You get a sense of chaos but also a wide base for big synth waves and a real plucky guitar solo. It’s got an edge to it. It bends toward psychedelia just a bit.\n\nThat piano riff at the top of “Sorcery,” the gong hitting it in, keeps the cinematic vibe going. But we’re working at a clip now. The whole a-side is shorter tracks, five of them. The synths—that organ tone—and the chorus of horns carries us through here. We get a synth solo first. Billy working it in that tight, funky tradition for the most part. Just a couple of slides into big, high-end chords, but mostly he’s working close to the middle up until the big finish. It’s a tight track that bleeds into a drum solo—super deep, super spacey, not so much sparse as like void, you know?—that then drops us into the title track: “A Funky Thide of Sings.” Real brassy here again but with slightly less of a rock edge compared to the opener. The guitar is thick, fully on the rhythm. The saxes are put to their paces too as it picks up. We get a bigger horn section on this one, Larry Schneider doing the sax work now. The horns are talking to each other as Billy’s drums get splashier as we go bigger and the guitar chimes in right before the horn lick comes back for the close. That last note, hit it with the big synth key. The drum rolls out. So much of this album needs opening credits rolling over it, man. How has this not been sampled more?\n\nBilly is showing some range on this side and “Thinking Of You” leans smooth. The brass is drowned inside a synth tone and flattened. The guitar is felt and then its solo is subdued too. Just little partial chords. And the energy is dialed down (other than the hoppy bass line) until the full-voiced sax solo. Back to the Breckers and Glenn Ferris for the horns. And the layering they do gets echoed later with another dope guitar solo out of John Scofield and a real slinky bass line under it. And that slinkiness, that fullness, that melodic-ness, is echoed in the closer to the a-side: “Some Skunk Funk.” We’re back toward bop, away from the smooth, but the bass line is bringing melody fully now. Almost leading the chord changes, and the horns are messy, jazzy, full of crescendoes and riffs, bouncing off the bass, ripping the whole way. Billy’s bringing it with a whole mess of percussion. By the time we stumble out over the drums we’re damn near breathless. \n\nSo it’s range then. Range is the name of the game. Smooth or edge. Cinematic soul or straight jazz. Billy moves his crew through them, showing range as a band leader, a writer, a composer. And then in the back half, those last three tracks, he’s gonna give you his range as a player. It starts with “Light At The End Of The Tunnel.” We’re in that cinematic lane here but you feel Billy getting heavier with his foot, carving out his fills when he wants, splashing around. The percussion is thick, man, and wide too. The bass and guitar have a lot to launch from because Billy is messing around with shakers, clicks, stomps, and a whole kit giving a thick, thick rhythm. And yeah, then he kicks in a tight solo around the outro. Sticking close to the rhythm.  More march than jazz, but that’s just warm-up, you’ll come to realize, after the last two tracks: “A Funky Kind Of Thing” and “Moody Modes.” Yeah. Jazz virtuoso shit comes fast. \n\n“A Funky Kind Of Thing” opens with some maintenance on the rhythm we just left. It keeps a beat and slowly fizzles out into this wild, free, sparse, solo. The central beat comes and goes on the kick drums. And when it goes we channel bop, you know? Sort of swing between bop and funk, the free form and the One, and blur those lines over time. And those military-sharp rolls in between give it a character, too. You can feel him thinking in all those directions. The transitions sometimes come sudden. Sometimes they’re gradual. They’re always cool as hell. In the back third of the track (9:24 total) we shift toward a Latin rhythm and bring in more to the percussion. Cowbells. Hand drums. And then it’s a psychedelic echo out. I think it’s someone at the board torturing a single cowbell hit. They bring it way loud. Mechanical. Then drop. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea but if you dig something like a “Maggot Brain” solo, try digging this track that way. \n\nOr, if 9+ minutes of psychedelic jazz-funk drumming isn’t your speed, maybe 12+ of brooding, soulful, experimental smoothness in “Moody Modes” is. This is the jazziest of the tracks but between “Funky Kind” and this you can feel Billy bringing his Miles days with him. He opens on the keys, that soft piano riff, wide synth notes come in underneath. Guitar and bass noodle just at the edge of the melody and then horn hits. The drums filling out underneath soaring brass chords. Then it retreats back into that piano riff, now deep in the mix. End scene, you know? Then piano back in. Light with it. Pretty even. Catch a triangle keeping time deep in there. Billy’s always in a groove. Even here. The piano ringing out lush, going deep, going heavy. Then a sharp turn of a horn strike, and that trumpet brings you into the next scene. The keys underneath go cross-eyed and Billy’s swinging on the kit now. Deep on that double bass now, going kinda wild on the rhythm of it all, right on the edge of the free jazz freak out, but whenever it’s about to stray, it’s like Billy hits a crash and pulls it all back in. It’s a jam, man. Randy Brecker killing the whole track on trumpet. Someone’s blowing deep on a reed in there too. Then the bass solo from Blake. Some assorted, sparse percussion under it. It’s a new scene all the sudden. The double bass screams jazz but it’s not even just that. It’s far out. It goes bluegrass for a split second. Then the snare clock reins us back in. Goddamn we’re covering ground. And it’s back to those opening brass strikes. Back to the big flute. Back to the crashes. Back to the sparse bass and the clicks. One last slide. Out. \n\nGoddamn. \n\nDig it.",

    "title": "Ohio Players - Honey (1975)",
    "content": "In October of 1974, Ester Cordet (real name Ester Sgobba) was featured as Playboy’s Playmate of the Month. She was among a string of notable features, situated between a September issue that featured now-Emmy-award-winning news persona personality Kristine Hanson and December’s issue with Bebe Buell. At the time of her appearance, Ester was a flight attendant. She was accompanied to the shoot by her husband, who ended up in the background of a shot and labeled a “friend” in print. Ouch. But what’s important for us about Ester Cordet’s appearance is that it caught the attention of the Ohio Players, a funk band out of Dayton, Ohio, who just dropped back-to-back platinum albums Skin Tight and Fire, and were accustomed to going to Playboy for the subjects of their next cover art. They decided to bring Ester in for the cover of their next album, the one that would become their most critically-acclaimed, the one that would arguably be the crown jewel of their mid-70s dominance, this one right here: *Honey*. \n\nAnd I’ll complain about NSFW tags here but they earned it on this one. Naked. I mean. Why even bother with the air brush? Anyway. It caught some eyes. And the eyes it caught were shocked enough to believe anything. Like, for instance, there’s a rumor that the honey they coated Ester with burned her skin and left permanent scarring, ending her ascendant career. That’s not true. She kept working, unharmed. Another, more colorful one, is that the Players killed this woman during the shoot and recorded it. In fact, some say, the high-pitched scream deep in the mix toward the end of the breakdown in the smash hit “Love Rollercoaster” (around 2:20 or so) is Ester’s last scream. \n\nThat shit ain’t true either. Ester’s very much alive, pushing 80, looking amazing. But after a DJ made it up and the legend took off, the Players brilliantly decided to take a vow of silence. Don’t confirm or deny. Let people talk crazy. That’s free marketing. And it worked. Platinum status for a third time. Goddamn. Not that I think they would’ve needed the story to get there. Nah. *Honey* is a jam, maybe especially outside of “Love Rollercoaster.” Let’s go track-by-track then.\n\n*Honey* is the third album with guitarist Leroy “Sugarfoot” Bonner as lead singer. My man brings a snarl to the mic that few other Funk acts can touch. It’s bluesy and pushes the Players toward the rock end of the spectrum, and it carries cool pretty much everywhere. The lead track here, title track, “Honey” capitalizes on this. It’s a slow jam, lush even with the strings and all, soft, soulful backing vocals at the jump, but that soft base gives Sugar all kinds of room to snarl and yarl and rap and whisper over it. It’s sensual with that tasteful, soulful edge of the strings, the airy horns, the high-end of the backing vocals. The Players always, always bring romance to it, even the dirtiest shit they put out comes by candlelight. I mean the drums here (Diamond Williams) come dramatic, the piano (Billy Beck) coupled with it being as percussive as a piano can get in that chorus and it’s all crescendo. Almost flashy. Cinematic. \n\nAnd that sorta cinematic vibe carries into the follow up track, “Fopp.” And here we get the dual vocal from Billy Beck. Dude can hit a high note. But as much as “Honey” shows a romantic side, this is all edge. Forward about it. Fopp is a verb. You feel it in that flutter in the kick drum, that guitar tone is heavy, metal, only outdone by Sugar’s vocal delivery, bringing blues with it.  “Fopped last night and the night before.” Self-aggrandizing. And that’s Billy on the falsetto, killing it: “Everybody was... FOPPINNNNNNN’!” The horns that rise up to meet it, man, you aren’t sure if they’re gonna make it and then they fall out. A beat. And then the horns cut it up—hard brass—with those snare shots under it. It’s physical.\n\nWe get a longer lead-in to the next one: “Let’s Love.” Love this slow jam.  “Let’s Love” echoes some of the spaciness from “Honey” but it’s deeper, the horns (that’s Merv Pierce and Pee Wee Brooks on trumpets and Satch on the saxophones), are a little bigger, and the piano (Billy Beck) is a bit more on top of the melody. It’s a cool instrumental, and I love that soft, rising vocal through the verse, there’s depth on it. By the time you hit that high-pitched bridge you’re hooked, and then at the perfect moment it drops you into the instrumental bridge, the piano vamping on it on the way out. They leave a lot of space in the back half and it’s all the better to sink down into the groove and really feel the highs in the backing vocal. Love this tune, man.\n\nThen we close out the A-side with the hyper groove that is “Ain’t Givin’ Up No Ground.” Man this one stumbles in and immediately goes off, and it’s all Billy. He runs the riff off the keys and solos on everything he finds lying around the studio. The Hammond, the Rhodes, the piano, it’s all up in here, not so much woven together or talking to one another as attacking the track from all angles. I mean don’t get me wrong either, Rock Jones with the bass is putting in work, even through the wobbly break underneath the key solo. Diamond obviously is setting the pace, but it’s really the biggest break away from the mic and into the instrumental that the Players give us here. And it’s a work out man. \n\nSide b opens with “Sweet Sticky Thing,” which leans melodic at the jump—that riff from Sugar, the high-end vocals out of Billy, the brass deep underneath, but the sax is always on edge, ready to bring a split second of hard jazz before dropped into a funk-rock chorus. This one is really the jam here. It’s big, spacious, turns in on itself and wanders. It’s got some of my favorite breaks of all time, that rolling guitar coupled on the bass, the sax noodling around on, and those vocals, man, sharp, unison. Always cool. Satch goes off on this one. That’s the headline. Chaotic. Urgent. And at the end that backing vocal, another break. A guitar solo, just ripping it. We’re all over the place man. What a thick, *thick* groove. And that freakout at the close man, wide keys on it. Out there, definitionally. \n\nThen it’s “Love Rollercoaster.” Iconic, dancey track. A little basic in the wake of “Sweet Sticky Thing,” sure, but the brass is real cool on it. I like that lick. The rhythm guitar is highlighted here more than elsewhere too, and the result is iconic. Choppy. The synth does ambience duty deep background but that clicky guitar tone is front and center. It’s just a whole different approach to their instruments, almost a 180 from “Sticky Thing,” and I think that’s partially why this one gets a bad rap. It can feel out of place in the album. The bridge and the breaks are cool though and deserve a shout. The late, sparse break with Ester’s infamous death scream (it’s a rough Billy take though in reality) is a cool moment, the chaos toward the close too. It might be the best highlight of auxiliary percussion you’ll get on *Honey*, honestly. And if there’s one thing I want more from these dudes it’s that percussion.\n\nThe closer, “Alone,” feels so ahead of its time. So much R&amp;B from the last 20 years hits like this. That real visceral guitar tone and strum, the chimes and the keys underneath. The vocal tone. Delivering lines like “this is just a silly game.” The cadence. It’s gorgeous. Heavy. Then you get those keys talking back and force on the crescendo, the split second break and that yarl: “This was just a silly gyayayaaaame.” There’s a tiny bit of psychedelia on it—especially in that guitar. And it’s proggy as hell in its structure, but it’s all blues at the same time. I adore this track, truly. At the end you feel the whole thing fall apart dramatically instead of fade out or close out. Goddamn. It hits hard as a closer. A final statement from Sugar with those blues. A final showcase for the keys. Leaves you exhausted but wanting more. Maybe it’s a good spot to close. Or as good as any. They showed you a whole lot already. \n\nReally, *Honey* closes in a way that makes you see just how ahead of the game these dudes were, arguably more than most from that era. Between the pleading, reserved, sparse R&amp;B in “Alone,” that hyper-groove, synth showcase in “Ain’t Givin Up,” and those back-to-back but completely opposite singles in “Sticky Thing” and. “Rollercoaster,” I mean come on now. You can’t deny how incredible this one is. Don’t doubt it. Go dig it.",

    "title": "Shotgun - Good, Bad &amp; Funky (1978)",
    "content": "Somewhere in the late 70s you can feel all the sudden a poppy-er, more palatable version of funk that isn’t quite disco but converging with that sensibility. Commercial bands arrive, you know? Not carving out territory really but reliably pushing out a fun, dance-able funk, often pretty brassy and usually verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus in their composition. I like a lot of these kinds of bands. I put Brass Construction in that lane. Some Rufus fits the bill. Commodores. It’s a profusion of acts that are sort of constructed for the moment. Some of it is ass. Some of it rips. Shotgun—the Detroit-born, Motown-bred band I’m here to talk about today—rips. \n\nShotgun was an ABC band that formed out of the dissolution of another band, 24-Carat Black. It’s a dope name for a dope group mentored by Dale Warren, the strings master over at Motown. Warren wrote and produced their only album, a heady concept piece, in 1973. It’s called *Ghetto: Misfortune’s Wealth*. Stax put it out. It is the proggiest of prog soul. It’s very cool. Dre, Nas, and Kendrick have sampled it. Kendrick a lot, actually. It’s widely available on streaming platforms and worth a listen. They would record another album and leave it unfinished when they broke up in 1974. They were all still teenagers.\n\nThen, within a year, 24-Carat members Billy Talbert (lead guitar and keys), Tyrone Steels (drums and vocals), Ernest Lattimore (guitar and vocals), and Greg Ingram (sax), teamed up with Larry Austin (bass), DJ Resch (drums), and William Gentry (trumpet) to form Shotgun. There hasn’t been a single crew I’ve written about (and it’s been weirdly a lot of them) that I’ve found less on. They aren’t in any books I own. Their online presence in minimum. They ain’t even on Spotify. I’m in the internet archive trying to find anything on these dudes and all I got is confusion on who the original trumpet player was. And that’s weird, man. Because they charted. Their self-titled debut peaked at a respectable #42. They landed singles, too. The radio single in the face of hyper-experimental, far-out, borderline institutionalizable Funk—and the funk-rock single, in particular—now that’s what Shotgun was shooting for, at least early. And they landed a couple big ones in 1978, off this album, this funk-rock party-on-wax that is *Good, Bad &amp; Funky.* \n\nThe first single off *Good, Bad &amp; Funky* was the lead, title track. And “Good, Bad &amp; Funky” is one hell of a lead single, man. It comes in all percussion with a chant behind it. But it’s not that Afro-centric, spiritual chant, you know? It’s a party chant: get on up and get off! And then it’s the guitar riff, low, distorted, a little ominous. It’ll couple with the piano, hit the downstroke a little harder, and it’s pure funk-rock. The vocals are of that straightahead, disco-has-hit-oh-shit soulfulness. It begs you to sing along, never going too high on the lead vocal. And that’s all praise. I want to say it’s almost close to Tower of Power. Commercial, you know? Digestible. And it’s the rock instrumentation and those vocals that make the so. And even deeper, it’s the percussion and the chant. Solid rock, man. We get it most in the vocal. Ernest and Tyrone can growl. They can take it high. They belt. And the backing sort of lean toward the funky unison—makes for a nice balance with the breaks. Love the bass line there too. \n\nSo the rock edge is set, you know? Almost an Isley vibe to me sometimes. And that’s where most of this album sits. “Danger of the Stranger” drives home the rock sensibility underneath the record. The horns hit here in a way they don’t in the singles. The solos rip, but otherwise it’s mostly color for me. The horn line here though is dope. It’s thin (it’s a thinner section generally) but it’s built into the groove in a cool way. The vocals here are also a little more rock n roll than elsewhere. Throaty. A little bit of a bluesy growl on it and it’s echoed in the guitar distortion. It’s loud. The big high note seals it. This is a rock band. And a bluesy one at that. “Sister Love” brings foot-stompin’ blues. Lyrics about queens in New Orleans with record machines. Lazy snare hits. That clavinet, the guitar noodling around it, the horns off doing their thing (here more than most places anyhow), and a straight stomp on the bass. The lyrics come in almost staggered. The track as a whole wants to make you think Meters but it’s more “Mississippi Queen” at its core, really. But then it’s got this voice box, like an effect almost, plays like a synth voice, and the way this extra bit comes in late and plays out with the drums at the close feels so out of left field but perfectly at home. Roger used to call his stuff the new blues and this feels like why, you know?\n\nIt ain’t all wild though. “Fire It Up” is more straight rock. Almost cheese. *Almost*. Not quite though. It’s got movement in the bass, and a cool open, it could be a massive track if it took off from there but it stays restrained. Cool riff. Horn accents give it some room, but it stays tight. Sticks to the formula. “Dance and dance and dance and dance.” The bass keeps the groove but no one does much with it. Even Ernest’s guitar solo gets turned down in the mix, close to home. It’s purposeful in that formulaic-feeling construction. It feels like an intermission, all most. Stretch the legs then come in back for the closer. And I’ll get to the closer eventually. \n\nBut first, now, that rock lane—wide though it is on this album, hitting blues, pop, dance in it—ain’t the only thing going. “Love Attack” was the second single off this thing, after all. And in my opinion it’s the better of the two. Very cool, big-when-they-need-to-be vocals. And goddamn that chorus slaps, even just the way they stwp into it—and then, yeah, even on a ballad kick it’s still all percussiveness again. DJ Resch on the kit with a bit of a flair on it, especially the hi hat. He snaps a couple times on this. Larry Austin’s bass in on the action, snapping off beat, rubbery, and driving the one-beat home. Those two lock in under Greg Ingram’s sax solo and just kill me. The groove is deep. And this is a bedroom track at heart. It’s the brand of Funk I will always go off about here when I get a chance. Bass heavy slow jams with a deep, sparse groove. And the vocals that agitate til they almost go full out of body, full gospel. Shit these dudes can sing. And in the second verse, the way they weave into the vocals? It hits for real. This one needs a link, dammit. \n\nAnd “I Wish I Could See You Again” is gonna drive home the tender, soulful ballad side of the album. It’s all Lattimore for the writing, Clare Fisher arranging the strings, the rest of the crew in the background, widening it out, letting that lead vocal float. It’s functionally acapella, but you can’t ignore that smooth rhythm section and goddam that guitar again? Even in the ballads these dudes can’t help but bring straight rock. Just a taste when they can. \n\nBut there’s another gear too, in tracks like “I’m All Strung Out,” that preview a disco turn on the horizon that Shotgun will partake in just a little. It’s got the soulful, pleading vocals, but they’re bigger and they got a little grit. The guitar is way clean, poppy, and the melodic notes in the bass and restrained drums make this all dance. All day. Horns come in to wiggle now and then and about halfway through the track, yeah, chimes. And then those strings. They got their own riff on it and it’s very cool. That whole extended breakdown is a victory lap for that brand of funk. Lush, pretty, poppy, dancey.\n\nBefore we go, we also need to sit for a second with the one-two punch at the close: “Space-N” and “All Spaced Out (All Funked Up).” “Space-N” is 87 seconds of ambient, digitized noise. Far out. Spacey. Foreboding. And the track that’s tied to it is “All-Spaced Out,” the closest thing to a horn showcase we get. It’s the closest to a synth-voice playground we get. There’s real horn lines in the JB vein, almost. There are laser noises out the synth. Radar noises. Space invader noises. It comes in on a solid, pop-funk riff, coupled the piano, and then the horns kick in cool before the vocal leads: a “woke up this morning” line. Those horns are circle back at the top of the chorus, playing on the vocals. But those vocals grow here--more voices than any other track. Less pressure on the performance, more room for horns. On a different vibe here. Bringing jam funk. A continuation of the Sly sound, just a little. Experimental, but the core is a rock jam. Enough throwing the composition out of the expected. Breaks turn to solos. Solos get passed rapid fire. The pieces play dramatically together. Horns cut into synths. Guitars cut into horns. The synth and guitar talk now, getting closer. Ernest kills one last guitar solo somewhere in the middle. It’s real cool. Everyone’s riffing now. Everyone. \n\nYou too, even. So go ahead. Rock on.",

    "content": "I really like the band, Cameo was funky, futuristic, and fly. They evolved with the times and their later albums, but never lost their groove. Their ability to pivot while still owning their sound is legendary. And if you listened to popular albums like \"single life\"and \"word up\" you've already experienced one of the greatest 80s funk albums ever tbh\n\n By the early 1980s, Cameo had not only redefined their lineup but also their entire  architecture. What set them apart—particularly from their contemporaries—was their forward-thinking embrace of synthesizers and drum machines, not as accessories, but as foundational instruments(of which was exceptional). Larry Blackmon was one of the first funk bandleaders to fully lean into the LinnDrum and Roland synths, crafting tight, punchy grooves that left behind the extended jams of '70s funk. You hear it clearly on “Single Life” and “She’s Strange”those tracks are built on minimalist, synth-heavy frameworks, allowing the rhythm section to breathe while keeping the groove relentless and danceable.\n\nTheir use of space was just as important as the notes they played. In “Word Up!”, for example, the synth bassline is stark, aggressive, and deliberate. The call-and-response structure, paired with Blackmon’s clipped, almost barked vocals, creates a track that feels both futuristic and rooted in African American rhythmic tradition. “Candy” is another key example—layered synth textures (also has a funky horn section) give it that sweet, melodic atmosphere, but it’s still anchored by a head-nodding, electronic funk rhythm that remains timeless.\n\nI know cameo is very popular amongst funk fans but their virtuosity has to be admired they created timeless pieces of music and their influence is undeniable,their longevity is insane too",

    "content": "I love the P-Funk ladies. I wrote about the Brides here before and *Funk or Walk*. George had a way of producing the ladies so they’d be multi-dimensional and big without going cartoonish. It’s powerful, it’s far out, it’s Funky. And even more than the Brides—even before the Brides, technically—I think that formula was tweaked and perfected with the other big name, P-Funk, girl group: Parlet. \n\nParlet wasn’t around long. A lot of these spin-offs weren’t. But they formed in 1978 essentially simultaneously with the Brides. It was part of a larger effort to get the ladies singing background—names like Mallia Franklin, Jeannette Washington, Dawn Silva, Lynn Mabry, Jeannette MacGruder—up front on their own records. Parlet dropped their album *Pleasure Principle* first, if “first” matters when it’s that close. Anyway, if you don’t know *Pleasure Principle* you should. It’s out there. That original lineup was Debbie Wright and Jeannette MacGruder, with Mallia Franklin joining on at the end of the session. Debbie left before the follow up, 1979’s *Invasion of the Booty Snatchers*. That album started with a lineup of Mallia Franklin, Jeannette Washington, and Shirley Hayden. Mallia left and was replaced by Janice Evans—some Mallia was left on the album though. They killed this one, too. Straight fire outta Parlet for real. \n\nThen, 1980 hit. Casablanca was collapsing. The P-Funk collective was gettin rocked but Parlet keeps that stable lineup with Janice, Shirley, and Jeannette. And they’re about to blow up—you can feel it. So on the back of *Booty Snatchers* and insane tour success they take to the studio to record their masterpiece: *Play Me or Trade Me*. It’s their way of telling the world it’s now or never. Fire track after fire track. Insane soul. Falsetto’s out the ass on this. We’re keying up two singles on this one because it’s too much heat. And nothin. We flop. Most stuff I’ve read points to financial problems depleting the promotional budgets—I think Universal was involved but I don’t know all the details—with Parlet joining a bunch of other projects in obscurity if only because no one bought the ad space. \n\nAnd that sucks, man. There’s too much good here. Play me or trade me. Let’s go. \n\nThe opener, “Help From My Friends,” is a bouncy tune, particularly that piano deep in it, and the rubbery,  brassy horns, the rolls on the hi-hat (Kenny Colton on the drums here keeping it cool). The wide melodies from our Parlet Ladies—Jeannette, Shirley, and Janice—washes over you like a wave. And what I love about the P-Funk ladies and George’s work with them is that it really leans on that juxtaposition. The tide-like, flowing vocals against the sharpness of the guitar, synth shots, handclaps, the punchy bass. They’ll reverse the formula at the outro, after a cool, extended break. They’ll go and let the synths be the tide drowning out the sharp chants: “Can I get a little help / From my friends?” Something so big about it. I read somewhere that George said something like this lineup was the best at that trademark, P-Funk mix of soul and sex. And you hear it here like a Siren song between deep Funk grooves. It’s real dope.\n\nMost of the album—everything but the opener and the closer in fact—has way more than just out three Parlet singers on board. “Watch Me Do My Thing” leads with the ladies but in that sing-song, rhyme-y kick P-Funk really owned outright. We got Bootsy on bass, Catfish on guitar, David Spradley on keys, love that combo, and it starts real noodle-y before getting real thick, real fast. The synth solo is wild, man. Spradley rips. All that, plus the addition of some real cool, very chill horn accompaniment from the newly-constituted P-Funk players (that’s gonna be Bennie Cowan on trumpet, Greg Thomas on the sax, Greg Boyer on trombone), makes for a wildly underrated P-Funk jam, man. The rhythm on this digs deep, Tyrone Lampkin stomping the drums the whole way. \n\n“Wolf Tickets” was the higher charting of the two singles off this. We need room to dig this one. George gets a vocal feature on it. Everyone gets a vocal on it, and the crew really chops it up alongside our Baltimore Connection (aka the P-Funk horns) plus Maceo. Jimmy Ali on bass, Kenny Colton on drums, Jerome Ali on guitar: I dig this combo with Parlet. There’s a brightness to the rhythm with them, fresh air in it, but steady on the one. Sort of hinting at four on the floor and heightening the dance-ability on the track. Truth be told the whole thing feels like it’s about to fall disco in the chorus—chimes and all—but it’s a groove for real, even if it holds off on real grit until the key solo. Jerome’s guitar underneath there, counter to it, really, brings it. That Funk. “Where it is?” It’s inside that soulful, gospel vocal toward the close, smacking down the brass and hitting a big downbeat. DAMN. The vocals carry us out then. They weave in and out each other. In and out the horns. But really it seems like we’re meant to dance this one out. As far as dance tracks go? P-Funk dance tracks? This one’s got to be up there. Someone link it if I forget.\n\nFlip it to side B. We’re taking this track by track.\n\nGeorge must have been on a dance kick in ‘80, because the other head writing credit he gets after “Wolf Tickets” is this one, “Play Me Or Trade Me.” The rhythm section (Kenny Colton on drums, Donnie Sterling on bass, Gordon Carlton on guitar), give it James Brown levels of urgency but it’s all got a dance floor edge. More wiggle than thump on the bass. A little dapper with the hi-hat, and the guitar just chugs. The vocals get a lot of space on it to vamp, too. The ladies make the most of it. Very cool and sparse, bringing attitude in the break and layering it thick. Four or five parts weaving rhythmic in some places. Melody cuts through now and then but really the mics have their own jam going. The vocal takes the track, more so than anywhere else on the album, so much so that there’s little left for the rest of the crew to do on it. It’s the statement track from Parlet. Hear it, man. \n\nAnd those vocals kill again on the next one, “I’m Mo Be Hittin’ It.” Real sexy, sometimes distant. Holding you captive. And the riff man, something ominous about it. The synth layered on that falling bass. After the intro when it thins out to make room for the handclaps, the percussion: that’s raw. Heavy. And there’s this sense of heaviness in the foreground the whole time, you know? The bass and the kick are louder than distant horns and vocal notes, but then the vocals come right up front—cut through all of it, right through the noise—and they’re on you. On top of you. Inappropriately so. It’s a cool effect. And shout out Ron Dunbar. I don’t know much about the dude. He doesn’t do much crazy. But his dialog adds a cool layer to this one.\n\n“Funk Until The Edge Of Time” leads in with all three of the Parlet ladies in unison, “doo doo doo dooo doodoo.” Temporarily back into a comfortable jam space. A little dance-soul feel on it too as the horns go wide with the synths in the chorus, the bass line stretches into those held notes, but the core of this thing is the bubbly scratch deep in the mix, the pop and slide on the bass, and the plod of the drums. There’s always a tier of bigness and elegance Parlet can reach, but their home is deep in the Funk. They tell us: they “love to Funk around.” “Funk is what we love to play.” It’s a straight-ahead track, man. The new P-Funk horns match the vocal cool perfectly, and cool is what this one’s about. We’re taking a hard 5 because then? Then.\n\nThen we’re left with the closer, the big ballad. “Wonderful One.” And by this point, you know, despite how cool this whole album is, I personally feel like I never get the full range of vocal prowess the record promises, you know? But we get it here. All of it. Deep bass and synth wiggle in and then strings hit, chimes. It’s immediate. The girls are deep on the backing vocal, soft, and there’s a pure, soulful cut into the track: “I wanna hold youuu... mmmmmmm mmmmmmm mmm.” They wouldn’t play this game alone now. They’re passing the lead and everyone brings it big. I read somewhere recently that this new generation of kids has started clowning the old soul and R&amp;B singers for getting all worked up about mundane shit in their songs. (The funniest version is Sisqo having a mental breakdown over underwear.) But that’s what soul is. That’s the draw. The bigness over nothing. Give us the biggest version of an emotion possible just to get the point across. And Parlet does exactly that here, and in a tight 4:00. The whole song is “I wake up. I am in love with you.” But they’re pleading it. Jeannette, Janice, Shirley. Begging. The synth starts running high to plead to you too, a preview of the falsetto the Ladies are eventually gonna reach for. They kill it. Obliterate it. Minnie who? Mariah who? The whole track is a vibe, it runs on the snap of the hi-hat, bobbing, keeping us afloat, and the crew goes nuts on top of it—the synth and vocal vamp at the outro is cool as hell. Fade out on the long note. Gotta smile at the close. Yo. \n\nParlet quietly disbanded after the album failed to chart. It’s unjust. So dig this one how it should’ve been dug half a century ago.",

    "title": "Sly and the Family Stone - Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I’m Back (1976)",
    "content": "In 1975, Sly and the Family Stone played one final gig at Radio City Music Hall. They bombed,  man. And not in the way you’d expect. I mean, Sly had a reputation of missing something like one out of every three gigs he’s booked, leaving stage mid-set, all that. And he had that reputation for a while. Nah, the ‘75, Radio City gig went off as planned and on time. The remaining members of the Family—Rose, Freddie, Mary McCreary, Andy Newmark—all made it happen. But it was empty. Something like 1/8th capacity, from what I’ve read, and the writing was on the wall. \n\nMaybe it was just too much faith was lost by then. Maybe people soured on the erratic behavior. I don’t know. The albums were good. *Fresh* is probably a tight #2 for me behind *Riot.* But the juice was gone, man, and those who were still around after the Graham Central exodus a few years prior peeled off one by one. Went and did their own thing. Freddie had success following Larry. Rose had a solo career. Sly was definitively post-Family now. Definitely on another track. He wouldn’t see another song chart after the dissolution of the Family. \n\nSly kept recording though. And I’m here to tell you that it ain’t like there’s nothing there. He brought it. Still. A little uneven with the rotating cast of former Family members and new collaborators, sure. Rose pops up in the studio. The Brides of Funkenstein do. So does George Clinton. Peter Frampton even. Session musicians too. You see, Sly was multitracking like crazy from *Riot* onward, layering, adding tracks, re-mixing, re-mixing, re-mixing, trying to cement something, a statement maybe, with what would be his last two albums for CBS. First, he did it as a solo artist on High On You. Then, he did it under the Family name, an attempt to reconstitute it but to go beyond it it, too, to honor the rock roots, the gospel roots, the raw Funk in Sly’s roots, to find himself, I think, once more, in this one: 1976’s *Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I’m Back*. And, business-wise, it was a trainwreck. Only one single was released from the album, “Family Again,” the closer, and after it failed to chart, CBS released Sly, remixed the early hits as disco singles, and released the remix album *Ten Years Too Soon*. What a slap in the face.\n\nAnd it’s not even warranted. This is a decent album. I’d even call it good. The opening, title track, leads is in with a party scene, the gang’s all here, and it’s got this dope percussion section that’ll run from there through the background of the whole track. And that punchy, Latin-infused bass line that rides the percussion between verses is hard, man. But overall we’re riding a soft rock edge on this track. It’s especially evident in the flutes (those are held down by Steve Schuster). There’s a clear tension Sly wants to set up between the syncopated percussion on one side and the soaring, wide, melodic guitar in the verse. The bass (either Sly or Dwight Hogan) navigates it in real subtle way that I dig a whole lot. We get a real thickly layered vocal that leans soft rock too. You can hear Cynthia all over it. And that vocal in the bridge kills me, just repeating the line--“Heard you missed me,  baby / Well, I’m back”--and the lead into Sly’s vocal vamp at the outro, kills too. It’s got vintage Sly all over it. The purposeful tension constructed between verse and chorus, the optimistic pop sensibilities in the instrumentation. The unison, group vocals. A lot of the album is an exercise in pulling those family elements, that comfort zone, forward. I mean take the follow-up track, “What Was I Thinkin’ in My Head.” It calls back a melody and a vocal delivery I’m vaguely recognizing from, like, “Running Away” or something, but poppier than that, something off the *Greatest Hits*. I can’t place it but it’s familiar and it’s comfortable in those verses. A little boogie but there’s strings coupled with wide vocals, giant chords running over the whole thing like a fog. Then juxtapose the chorus. It’s almost a Gap Band chant. Punchy on the bass. Splashy on the drum kit. Chopped up brassy in the horns. And a long break. The groove in it calls to the verse a bit, softening the tension between those two, then all the backing vocals. It’s a good effect. Vintage Sly again, man. \n\nIf there’s one place where we see true vintage Sly in action though, really embodying the stuff he invented a decade prior, it’s the hooky-ness of these tracks. “Sexy Situation” brings it on that old school organ rock kick we got out of Sly back with the big hats and white suits. The vocal is delivered layered, not really melodic. It’s a funky sing-a-long as only Sly could do it. The guitar noodles wildly underneath, but you’re tapping along with the “uh huh” instead of focusing on that (or the synths and keys woven all through it, like a wall of distant, fuzzy funk coming at you). Or take “Everything In You Has To Come Out,” that hookiness slathered in gospel. Riding on those strings. So big it eclipses the quaint funk groove underneath it. “Let’s Be Together,” delivered in that high, boogie register, floating on top of an army of congas and a four-note walk of a bass line that’s going to splash and lay out in the chorus. Then the backing vocals. “Don’t. Stop. Stop, don’t. Don’t stop. Stop. Don’t.” Got P-Funk on it. The Brides. Just a bit over the top. It’s a highlight. “Gimme. Gimme. Gimme. I want. I want. I want.” You can’t not sing it. Vintage Sly. Again. \n\nWe get lots of vocal territory covered on this one, for sure. “Nothing Less Than Happiness” is bluesy, soulful. It swings. A gorgeous duet vocal between Sly and Lady Bianca, billed here as “m’lady Bianca.” A different thing. A soulful thing and a cool thing, but a different thing. “Blessing in Disguise” is another vocal showcase but this time it’s all Sly’s and it’s soaring. A real rock track out of this one. A cool moment toward the end where it’s the whole crew on a gang vocal but here it’s got some psychedelia on it, a little echo, a little bit of the heavenly, you know? It’s Sly going big in a way we don’t often see him do it, and really in the service of the melody. Not that it’s such super rich, but when you work around a vocal crescendo as that key element, the whole track has to work to up to that point. Chords change, keys come in, bass goes wide, strings, hit “BLESSIIIIIIIIIIIIIING” with the horns, drop out dramatically, strings out. Into the bridge, and even there its vocals driving the track. It’s cool shit. Grand in its coolness, even. \n\nOne of my favorite places I see Sly reaching on this though is in “Mother Is a Hippie.” It’s a wild track. The hi-hat is on hyper drive with this wiggly synth on it during a real, real cinematic open. That riff rips, man. But it’s punctuated by these verses in a rock idiom that have upbeats accented, almost a ska effect in between proggy, cinematic soul/funk. And it shouldn’t work, but it does. Sly has that landscape in front of him and he’s in control. He solos on it. He builds a bridge on it. He blends the disparate pieces together in a way that works and is inherently funky, a mix of that early psychedelia and that 70s monster funk that he hasn’t mashed up this way before. It’s a cool track. It moves a lot. It’s got a real proggy but soulful vibe as a result. It does more than a your standard 3-minute Sly track usually does. Dig that one for sure. \n\nBut the real Funk here, Sly showing why he’s Funk royalty, is on “The Thing.” GodDAMN. This is the thickness. It slaps. The little bass chord in the lick. The wide wah chord. The cowbell, steady. I mean of all instruments to tether us to the groove it’s that. And that’s on purpose. You want to be lost in the track--or at least the parts between the rising, cinematic choruses. Sly’s laugh. That affect. The horns holding chords, waaAAAaaaaAAAaaa. And the interplay of the vocals, Sly against the backing chorus. He’s on one with this groove. And that bass, man. Sparse but heavy when it hits those fills toward the close. It’s a depth of Funk Sly touches only a couple times in his discography and I’m actively telling you that this track is one of the Funkiest the man has. He might give you party organ now and then, but legit he’s on a strut with this. Where has this been sampled? Nowhere? Damn. \n\n At the end of the day, it’s the new that hits on *Heard Ya Missed Me*. It’s the new I want more of. And I think that’s where Sly is lost by the industry. CBS put out the wrong single. It should’ve been “Mother Is A Hippie” or “The Thing.” Even “Sexy Situation.” Instead, Sly wrote a song that’s supposed to be a reunion track but, nah. It’s the closer. The lasting impression. “Family Again.” A little voice box on it, a little electro blues right at the top, but then it’s all passing the vocal, unison, introducing the rhythm, zappety, zap zap, rattatatat, pass to the next vamp, the keys, the bass, “Sly gonna make you high.” It’s “Dance to the Music” for a different era, Sly trying to channel the whole family through himself. But there’s something missing. Maybe it’s because he can’t really pass the vocal when it’s just him in the studio? Maybe it’s the lack of extra brass with the sax? It’s busy but lonely, you know? The musicianship is great but there’s an emptiness to it. There’s no jam on it, is what it is. At one point we have keys positioned like they’re talking back and forth. Dialoging. You don’t feel someone building off someone else because it’s all Sly. It’s fine, but it’s forced, you know? And if Funk doesn’t come natural, you know it.\n\nSo, Sly tried to reinvent the family but as a one-man-band. The album title and the cover art show you it’s a solo album. The single tries to be something else. But if you can dig it for everything else, all the soaring soul, all the deep Funk, all the big rock melodies, this one has some real fire on it. So go ahead. Dig it.",

    "title": "Herbie Hancock - Thrust (1974)",
    "content": "If it’s OK, I’m gonna assume a lot of folks around here my age and younger might not know who Herbie Hancock is.  But Herbie Hancock—jazz pianist, keyboardist, synth pioneer—is the shit. \n\nDespite having zero formal training until his 20s, Herbie Hancock landed in Chicago immediately after college in Iowa and fell into Donald Byrd’s band (where DeWayne McKnight first took off) in 1960. And from there, man, a full sprint toward icon status. By ‘63 his album *Takin’ Off* was being talked about, putting his single “Watermelon Man” (the original version) out in the world and getting the attention of. Miles Davis. Before long, Herbie is bringing his early electronic work to Miles’s quintet, runnin’ and jammin’ with names like Ron Carter (prolific bassist every bassist should know), Wayne Shorter, Mtume Heath (yeah, the “Juicy Fruit” drummer), and Dewayne McKnight (yeah, that one). It’s an era of rhythmic backlash against the untethered, asymmetrical, bop freak-outs of the old school, and the future of Funk royalty are at the center of it. Herbie is at the center of it. \n\nSo while he’s in sessions with Miles, evolving from post-bop experimentation to the kinds funky, tweaky sort of tracks we get on *On the Corner* and *Jack Johnson*, Herbie’s also building new worlds with synthesizers and forming his own bands. The first is the super-spiritual, electro-centric, Afro-centric sextet Mwandishi. This shit is wild. It’s got Bennie Maupin playing a psychedelic bass clarinet on top of Herbie manhandling the insides of synthesizers. I love it. *Sextant* is my favorite album from this crew and you hear Herbie circling real funk, that “Chameleon” Funk. That Headhunters Funk. And that’s his second band. He kept Maupin and that wild-ass bass clarinet and then added bassist Paul Jackson out of the Bay Area funk scene and Harvey Mason (later replaced by Mike Clark) and Bill Summers on percussion.\n\nWeird crew. And they killed it. Immediately that first album, *Head Hunters*, sprints up the jazz charts and sits there for 15 weeks. “Chameleon” becomes a DJ staple. The album gets sampled to death. “Watermelon Man” becomes an iconic track yet again, this time entering Herbie and the jazz world into an era of new, rhythmic fusion that’ll somehow break the seal and put jazz cats on MTV for a hot minute. Real funky shit out of these dudes. In this first iteration, the Headhunters would go on to drop four albums under Herbie’s name—*Head Hunters* (1973), *Thrust* (1974), the live album *Flood* (1975), and *Man-Child* (1975)—before a long hiatus should send Herbie into much more commercial territory. \n\nAnd for some reason I’m obsessed with *Thrust* right now. I think it’s slept on, probably because we get “Chameleon” and “Watermelon Man” right before it,  and wah pedals and “Hang Ups” right after. You want proof? Actual Proof?\n\n“Palm Grease” starts with Mike Clark on the drums, laying it down thick. The kick drum comes at you a little muffled, and then the clarinet lays down on top of it. Talking to you, then talking to Paul Jackson’s bass line, noodling while the keys pluck and stab. It’s a thick groove and the moment it’s established we’re in a percussion break. All hand drums and steel drums. Just barrels through. There’s something theatrical about it but so down to earth too, you know? Bennie Maupin ends up swinging through with a pretty par-for-the-course sax line on top of layered synths—highly electric now—at about the mid-point. Highly syncopated there too. The bass drives a good bit of the groove now, too, rumbling along at parts, kind of digging in and guiding a chunk of the melody. The keys play off it, the sax plays against it, really Jackson at the center with the solos passing, divvied up between percussion breaks. Late in the track the synth sort of wears an echo on it and you get the sense of crescendo and of losing a little control. Just for a second it’s chaotic and then pulled back together. And it’s the bass, the wiggle in it, a quick slide, a note held just a second too long, latent compression on it, that makes it work. Then, deep deep, the wide, angelic, cosmic synth chords. Not a crescendo as much as divine intervention. Arrests the whole track and shuts it down. What a statement Herbie makes there, man. Allow me to shut this shit down. I can’t remember if it was Herbie or Miles who said something once about the appeal of Funk being the simplicity of the underlying elements—like you can go cosmic big on it, or full freak-out, but the foundations are universal, of the people. That idea is fully formed by the end of the opening track, you know? Herbie’s gonna take it to big, weird places, but he’ll hold us down to earth, keep us in the dirt, with the Funk. \n\n“Actual Proof” is the other half of side A. It was originally put together for a movie soundtrack for *The Spook Who Sat by the Door.* I don’t know anything bout it. “Palm Grease” was in *Death Wish.* I know a little about that. But “Actual Proof” is a jazzy, rumbling tune. Guttural on the bass, swinging on the drum kit in these sort of fluid, key-driven moments (Herbie highlights the Fender Rhodes on this one). And it’s got the sort of standard jazz hits—unison on the bass, the horns, the keys, the cymbals: ba ba baaa! It’s the most straightforward jazz tune of the four we get on *Thrust*. The funk really lives in the sparser bass, but even then Paul rambles, man. It’s got bop on it. And the whole track feels like the band setting up a bop and then barreling through it over and over again. More conflict than fusion. We get a relatively funky refrain but it’s a little stiff. Dig the riff though. And then it’s wide, cosmic keys flying in again, horns and woodwinds coupled with it this time. That push-pull between the stiff groove and that flowing melody really turns out to be a funky constant on this one. \n\n“Butterfly” kicks off the b-sides and is an easy favorite. It glides in on some rising string tones, all the silky smoothness of a bossa nova but not quite that. The bass comes melodic but against the drums it sorta manages to round out a groove, especially when it uncouples from the horn melody, and especially in the more syncopated, more rubbery moments. And that reed, man. Just solo wailing on it deep in the mix. Sparse in places too. It’s that and the strings, the synths, that carve a path but the rhythm--especially Bill Summers with the hand drums going opposite that snappy snare--owns the track. At one point Paul Jackson on the bass expands and wiggles it up, actively cutting against Bennie’s solo, getting almost too busy before a reset. \n\nEven the Herbie solo is mixed just under the lip of that punchy bass for most of the track. Like the string voice is layered four or five times so it can try to escape the current of drums but it doesn’t matter much. It takes more than that to break out and give that sort of electro-angelic bigness Herbie pushes with his synths and organs and all. It takes a second, bigger, track-ending Herbie effort. So he doubles down. He builds as he goes. He pushes. And far from the softness of the solo piano, now we got organs and synths in each hand, bringing those chords flying down on one side and going on an all-out sprint up and down and organ with the other. Summers jumps on with congas, pacing the whole thing, and then Mike Clark on the kit starts getting busy too. It’s a highlight of the record, punctuated all the more when we drop out into something a little more downtempo. A little moody. Echoes of the opening riff. Big bass notes. The reeds again. And a real lush, stringy voice on a synth again wiping that slate clean at the close. Every track is a techno wizardry mic drop, man. \n\nBut for my money the real solid Funk on this is found in “Spank-a-Lee.” Real low on the horns, I’m not even sure what Bennie broke out on this. A bass something just rattling rib cages on the one. The deepest one I’ve ever heard. Contrast that with a drum lick I swear I know from Tower of Power (remember that Bay connection) and some wiggly keys, a real wandering bass line—like dude is fully on his own journey—and it’s a thick groove, man. Everywhere you turn it’s someone sneaking a note, a hit, an accent. Real jam shit. Real jazz shit. Bennie’s sax solo seems to want to remind us that this is jazz, after all. Like all funk is jazz, after all. It gets into that cool, noir space before giving just a bit of repetition, after all, like it’s just on the edge of that real Funk, after all, the Horny Horns stuff, before it slips back into that free jazz space. It’s a jam that passes the combo effort more than the solo. It’s not clear who leads in any moment. It’s spontaneous, like factually so, at its best, and under that Bennie solo you can hear four limbs from Herbie bringing spontaneity on a whole army of keyboards. Multiple synth voices, pianos, organs, it’s a funky, free-jazz wall of sound. If you can dig it, you will, and if it ain’t your vibe, well to each their own. \n\nWe end up from there in this extended, syncopated break that’s bringing all the circularity and thickness of a funk groove but it’s just a bit shakey, you know? The horns wail. The congas pick up. The bass keeps steady on the high pops but eventually goes to sludge alongside some freaky keys, a squishy sound we’ll get more out of Herbie later in the decade but here just sounds alien, especially with such clean bass under it. Nah, the wild effects here are all digitized under Herbie’s hands. The other weirdness comes from centuries-old, rare percussion and reeds and woodwinds in hands of jazz masters. The core rhythm section though is classic Funk. And the play of those elements, man, that funky Afro-futuristic, free-jazz-matic, electro-traditional madness, that’s where you’re at with Herbie in this period. And this album, Thrust, is the best illustration of that tension. \n\nSo go on then. Dig it.",

    "title": "Earth, Wind, and Fire - Open Our Eyes (1974)",
    "content": "We all know the Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire single “Shining Star” off 1975’s *That’s The Way Of The World.* “You’re a shining star / No matter who you are, / Shining bright to see / What you could truly be.” It’s a banger in that positive-mental-attitude lane, that semi-angelic, high-register, good vibes funk. It’s the sort of track that took EWF into a tier of international, all-time, GOAT conversation that transcends anything we’ll talk about here.\n\nEarth, Wind, &amp; Fire thought the album was doomed though. Quick story: in 1975, Sig Shore, producer of *Super Fly*, approached EWF about working on a film project titled *That’s The Way Of The World.* More than the soundtrack though—which they would lock down control of—the group would also play a fictionalized version of themselves (“the Group”). And look, man. I haven’t seen it. I’ve read about it. It sounds bad. The whole movie is about a record producer played by Harvey Keitel who is producing for the Group (EWF) and then his boss or some station executive tells him no you have to prioritize this new act we signed, the Pages. And it’s a whole allegory about how the Pages are cookie-cutter and the Group is more real or whatever but also Harvey Keitel is in a relationship with a woman he hates or something? And I guess he marries her and somehow all the records get made. I don’t know. Somehow it sounds like confusing as shit but also like nothing happens. And EWF thought it was ass. They were so convinced the movie was ass, in fact, they rushed the soundtrack out before the movie was released. Give it a chance to sell something before the movie tanks any promotion, right? But nah. “Shining Star” goes bananas on the charts and EWF become the first black artists to top the Billboard 200 and the soul chart at the same time. \n\nBut let’s be clear now. That wasn’t especially crazy. I mean I love these stories about the unexpected single—an unexpected album—doing numbers. But Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire had already been putting up numbers. See, in 1972 they switched to CBS and immediately dropped jazzy, funky heater after jazzy, funky heater. Their 1972 album *Last Days and Times* went to #15 on the U.S. soul chart. 1973’s *Head to the Sky* would go all the way to #2 on the soul chart and they’d chart a single, “Evil,” off it too. Then, in 1974, the crew went back into the studio and capped off a crazy run with the Maurice-White-produced, kalimba-infused, afro-centric, jazz-rock-driven, soulful, worldly but cosmic, artsy *Open Our Eyes.* \n\nOpen?\n\n*Open Your Eyes* leads with heat. A heavy chord on the one that launches us into “Mighty Mighty,” the third single off the album but the one that would chart highest. The horns are wiggly as shit on it. Slick even. And the synths too, sometimes doubled up on the horns and sometimes on their own kick. It’s a groovy track. Steady too. Everyone sort of chugs along, you know? No terribly fancy fills. No big solos. A few interesting changes but not a step out of time to get it done. It’s a vocal track at the end of the day. The vocals shift from that crashing, crescendo high-end, to the in-unison, party vocal and back a couple times. And finally at the close they come together and it’s just a that fictional, near-Mariah-range falsetto out of nowhere. It’s wild.\n\nThe vocals get the driver’s seat a few times, in fact. The follow-up track, “Devotion,” also a popular single off the album, brings it very soulful, a little less ornate, feeling spiritual but in a mystical way. Al McKay, Verdine, Maurice, all in the background, airy, and Phil Bailey launches a cosmic falsetto off it. It has the shape of gospel but it isn’t that. It’s softer, airier. You hear that cosmic airiness  better in “Feelin Blue,” a track so jazzy it creeps up on bossa nova territory. They pass the vocal around but keep it in that ethereal space, setting us up for a sci-fi epic of a synth solo. Horns come in wind to help hold us down while these dudes do everything they can to send us into space. Shoutout to Al McKay’s guitar at the close of that one. \n\nAt the end of the record we get a couple more great vocal tracks out of “Caribou” and the title track, “Open Our Eyes.” “Caribou” is heavy on the organ, the whole vocal is scatted—no words at all—just sort of a Latin base underneath the airy vocal until, once again, Al McKay comes in and kills a guitar solo. Frantic this time with it. Very cool. And then yeah “Open Our Eyes,” the title track, is hands down the true vocal showcase. Gospel on it. Big ol’ melodies. Pianos layered on organs, long low notes out of the bass, just a slight clap of a hi-hat holding us down. And how cool the delivery of “open our eyes” is, that vocal, the “Oooo” under it. Beautiful. \n\nReal jazz hits in the medley made out of “Spasmodic Movements” and “Rabbit Seed” a frantic, experimental, tonal drum-and-chant sprint leading into swinging drums, punchy, walking bass lines, a virtuosic sax solo, and then a quick collapse of a fade-out into chants again. It’s a wild, impressionistic corner late in the record that’s a reminder of everywhere Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire come from, everywhere the funk tradition comes from. \n\nThere’s solid, thick-groove funk on this thing too. “Fair But So Uncool” reins the vocal in for the most part—the backing gets into the high stuff but we’re mostly down the middle on it otherwise—in favor of the percussion. Even the synths are traded in for pianos on this. We got a sea of congas and bongos that sort of hypnotize until Verdine’s bass snaps us out on that big drop beat. “Tee Nine Chee Bit” takes us to that space too, down to that dialog at the open. Street funk. The bass all staccato in the groove. The guitars layered, shredding almost blues-like. Pure funk. Old school funk. All drum and bass and commentary, inside the party. It’s the closest we see to party and bullshit out of Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire. \n\nBut the brand of Funk I’m into right now, what we get here that we don’t get enough of elsewhere, that jazzy, Afro-driven, syncopated funk, that first pops up in “Kalimba Story.” And “Kalimba Story” brings it now, with a little bit more of a rock edge maybe. Al’s guitar traces the vocal in the chorus and keeps it steady and thick in the verse. Verdine’s just marching, maybe a little strut in the changes. But the real story on that one is the kalimba, the African “thumb piano” Maurice got obsessed with and mainstreamed here. It’s a dope sound. Something aquatic about it to my ears. And he kills the solo on “Kalimba Story” and then again on the top of the b-side with “Drum Song,” a sort of afrobeat/jazz/folk hybrid that comes in movements. First it sprints at a pace that’s almost disorienting—the kalimba on its own. The main groove there is deep though, man. A shaker just digging the earth beneath your feet. For most of it. The kalimba groove circular and the bass chugging along, straying only now and then and only on the four, sort of gives it a sway, a two-part groove until the track turns into more of a jam. Tons of metallic percussion in here—not sure what it is but it’s deep and it’s wide for a minute. One of the coolest jazz-funk jams on record right here, absolutely. \n\nIf you stream it, a re-mastered version exists with some “previously unreleased tracks.” The best one is called “Ain’t No Harm To Moan.” But no matter where and how you dig it, go dig it heavy man. These dudes are too heavy not to dig.",

    "title": "Bootsy Collins - Ultra Wave (1980)",
    "content": "There’s a lot to be said about the Parliament-Funkadelic collective’s business model, right? Take a crew of like 30 and from that build a roster of acts, mixing lineups under new names. The Brides. Rubber Band. The Horny Horns. All kinds of solo projects. Release all these on different labels, in-house labels included. Everybody could eat. Everybody could go off on anybody’s record or single. One jam session could produce three albums for three acts led by three different cats on three different labels, all fundamentally the same lineup. And I mentioned a while back this story I heard about one of those kinds of sessions, a P-Funk jam in ‘75 that produced most of the tracks for *Funkenstein*, two different Funkadelic albums, and the debut for a new concept that George had (and Bootsy didn’t yet know about), Bootsy’s Rubber Band. \n\nMy hot take is that Bootsy’s Rubber Band is the best project in the P-Funk catalog, period. Four albums that explore the entire psychedelic range of the bass. Four albums of absolute funky, proggy, far-out, extraterrestrial, hypersexual, atomic Funk grooves. *Stretchin’ Out in Bootsy’s Rubber Band* (1976), *Ahh... The Name Is Bootsy, Baby!* (1977), *Bootsy? Player of the Year* (1978), and *This Boot Is Made for Fonk-N* (1979). You know a bunch of the singles. They get talked about around here: “Telephone Bill,” “Hollywood Squares,” “Munchies,” “Bootzilla,”“Psychoticbumpschool,” “Jam Fan.” Bootsy the frontman was long overdue. And Rubber Band—the combo of Bootsy, the Horny Horns, Catfish, Kash, egging each other on, pushing each other bigger—was the perfect vehicle, man. \n\nBut Bootsy wasn’t content to stop at the mythological bigness, the psychedelic monstrousness of those Rubber Band albums. Nah. In 1980, he’d find himself pushing in two directions in these P-Funk jams, recording two albums simultaneously and dropping them in the same week. The older of the two is a self-titled album for the legally re-named Sweat Band (formerly Rubber Band). It’s dope. To my ears it brings a smaller, more straightforward and danceable funk sound. The second, though? The second album would give Bootsy more of the reins, man. It would stay big. It would embrace the looming dominance of electronic themes, dip its toes into the burgeoning hip-hop scene, and keep those progressive, heavily referential structures in place, all while introducing the world to Godmoma, on this, 1980’s *Ultrawave*. Bootsy’ first solo record. \n\nLet’s go already. *Momma’s little baby loves short’nin, short’nin / Momma’s little baby loves short’nin bread.*\n\nThat folk tune, the melody of it, is where *Ultrawave* opens. It’s a folk song that dates at least to 1912. It’s played here on a rubbery synth tone. And this album as a whole is really going to be rooted in the traditional—traditional funk, traditional rock n roll, traditional folk—but only so it can present them in this brand new way. The Horny Horns are here. Fred Wesley is here. But this isn’t the horn-heavy, Parliament sound Bootsy was messing with before. It’s not even the psychedelic, monstrous funk of Rubber Band. Nah, “Mug Push” kicks in and we get the thick-wristed guitar but it’s all keys, synths, looooong bass notes, Bootsy’s rapping on it. Yaaaaaaaabba dabba doo! His name is MUG PUSH. Love this track, man, and an extra shoutout to Bootsy’s drumming on that outro. What a statement of an opener. \n\nThe thing that hits me most about the 80s, solo Bootsy sound is the under reliance on the Horny Horns. We lose a bit of that brassy bigness. You’ll catch Fred and Maceo deep in the mix but it’s a brand of funk that, true to the cliche, pivots hard to the keys and synth voices starting January 1st, 1980. “F-Encounter” is where that pivot is most apparent. We get Maceo on sax and flute, two trumpets from Richard Griffith and Larry Hatcher, Fred Wesley on trombone, and it’s just light seasoning they’re engaged in. One, small bit of flavor. At one point in an earlier break you can actually hear a line from the trumpets bubble up and then the keys echo it and smack it down. Those keys man, those synths. They’re the real force now. Mark Johnson takes this track and makes it wiggle. He lays claim to a whole lot of space and plays off damn near everybody. Like he’s stalking prey. There’s points I think Bootsy lets him cannibalize the bass line. Claiming the whole damn song. And if it’s not the keys taking up space it’s Godmoma on the backing vocal. On “F-Encounter” they deliver like they’re the other half of the horn arrangement. High-pitched “Oooooooooovertiiiime” crashes down into the brass and then the follow-up line “For lovers only...” jumps back off the trumpet. Those little details get me. \n\nWe creep up to that big, horn-heavy, classic Parliament sound in a few places though. Straight throwbacks to “Mothership” show up in “Mug Push,” and so does a bit of a nod to Funkenstein’s “I get so hung up on bones.” But for a full track “It’s A Musical” might be the closest. The horn riff guides the guitar and bass from the jump and it’s a brassy sound, man. A whole marching band it sounds like in there. Bootsy and George share the lead vocal. The Brides (not credited as such) got the backing. And the bass carries that Bootsy-standard wetness but skips a bit still. Bootsy’s drums are a little splashy, too. It’s a nice mix. And there’s a moment deep in the break where the bass just sort of starts sliding. Just up. Down. Bootsy steps out and observes the party. Catfish keeps chugging along. Nothin but a party, y’all. And then, for the funk of it, this wild, cinematic, brassy outro. Come on, now. But then, that’s it. Outside of those, Fred and Maceo don’t make an appearance. \n\nWhat we get is “Is That My Song,” a straightahead but very cool piano blues tune that feels like a wild throwback that’s serves as a vocal highlight, both Bootsy’s cartoonishness and the smooth backing vocals out of Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent. And we get “Fat Cat,” a track that lets Parlet, the Brides, Peanut and them take that horns out of the mix so entirely that t’s voices and a rolling snare that end up taking up big real estate early in the track. David Spradley brings an outright seizure of a synth bass line just because, it seems. But when you clock it leading into the late breaks it hooks you. The track sort of shifts electro for a minute, then we really cook out of the break. The bass, drums, vocals all roll. Catfish takes a solo, just noodles up against that synth, feeling itself. \n\nAnd we get some throws to that Rubber Band sound. “Sacred Flower,” my personal favorite, goes full psychedelia, almost making “Fat Cat” look new wave in comparison. We’re a little on that “Telephone Bill” cadence for a second, and then we bring echoes of the “I’d Rather Be With You” riff, then that “Telephone Bill” riff is copped. And Bootsy mixes references wildly throughout the album, but here he’s getting it all. He stretches his references, raps over them, noodles over them, yells at a dog over them. And instead of horns we get an electric flute, not a huge presence but noticeable among the digital noise underneath. But really it’s the deep, distorted bass tone that sells this track. Toward the end we get it almost fully computerized but raw, half thrash fuzz and half dial-up static, and the vocal echoes it, a deeply human wail run through a phone jack. It’s like no matter what funk Bootsy brings in the eighties, that experimentation is pulling him further and further to that electro, proto-rap lane. \n \nAnd that lane is best filled by the closer, “Sound Crack.” The low-end distortion id carried over, layered in synth voices and bass tones, popping out for a second before retreating to such a cloud of keys I can only think of it as melodic static. That futuristic soundscape builds underneath a semi-melodic chant out of the regular cast of backup vocalists and Bootsy, the rhinestone rockstar, just struttin’ on it. A bit of the way in he’ll elevate it, bring chimes in for some soaring female vocal accompaniment, but then it’s back under. Deeper. Chord changes like that keep creeping in, chimes in and out, keys shifting lanes, Bootsy on guitar on this just noodling throughout. Bootsy on drums building to the longest crescendos only Bootsy can reach, pure fills and urgency. Bootsy on bass holding it down steady. Cracking inside jokes only he, the drummer, and the guitarist are really in on, you know? It doesn’t even end on beat. \n\n*Momma’s little baby loves short’nin’, short’nin’ / Momma’s little baby loves short’nin’ bread.* Take your dead ass home and dig it.",

    "title": "Prince - Dirty Mind (1980)",
    "content": "In 1979, Rick James set off on his first headlining tour. This was for *Fire It Up*, which dropped a year or so before *Street Songs*. Rick was ascendant, and he was about to become the icon of the 80s we know him as. He needed an opener that would, meet the insanity of the Rick James stage show, one that would match the energy without overshadowing it. Management thought they found it in a newer, Midwest club act with the government name of Prince Rogers Nelson. \n\nYou know him as Prince. The Artist. The Artist Formerly Known As Prince. The Love Symbol. The Androgynous One. But at the time he was Prince who had just dropped his sophomore, self-titled album and was ready to promote it somewhere bigger than the Twin Cities club circuit. So he was out there for a bunch of dates with Rick. But he was also learning. And working.\n\nThere are a ton of stories about the Fire It Up Tour and the feud that developed between them during the tour. And I’m not here to adjudicate it. But a few anecdotes stand out. Prince stole Rick’s moves and performed them at subsequent dates. Prince had his body guard put him on his shoulders and walk through the crowd during Rick’s sets, taking attention of the stage. Rick’s mom asked for an autograph and Prince said no. Truth be told it was probably more of a competitive thing than anything. There’s plenty of evidence as early as the autograph thing that they were cool enough with each other, even if Rick talked a little trash and Prince stoked the drama just for fun. Prince gave Rick’s mom that autograph. They hung at awards shows. Prince might have crashed parties with an entourage and Rick might have thrown cognac at him but, you know, there’s respect there. Well... mostly...\n\nIn any case, Prince wasn’t just honing his stage craft on Rick’s tour. He was actively writing a new album of material for his new band--André Cymone on bass, Dez Dickerson on guitar, Gayle Chapman and Dr. Fink on keys, and Bobby Z on drums. Half the songs would start from scratch on this tour and round out this album, one of the funkier selections in the Prince discography, 1980’s *Dirty Mind.*\n\nThe opening, title track, “Dirty Mind” ain’t funk. It’s funky in its composition--no chorus, kinda marching along--but it’s straight pop. Synth pop really. The rising vocal in the verse is the closest we get to a structure, sort of looping us back in turn. And Prince sells it with that voice. The falsetto. Silky smooth, distant until the urgency. That urgency makes the song. It makes the drums make sense. It makes the lack of Funk, itself, a little funky. And this album is really Prince poking around the edges of funk while he settles on that Minneapolis sound. Part of that sound is of course the dominant keys and synths, and yeah, this opening track is the creation of Doctor Fink himself, a staple of Prince’s backing bands, who brings it with that riff. Ice cold. The four on the floor underneath holds it down, the percussion as a whole really. It’s an icy, spacious, ethereal track if not for the drums marching along. Just a little too staid for the Funk. \n\nNow, we do get that beat echoed in a funkier way with “Uptown” later on. And yeah man this track slaps. It’s that disco 4x4 but more on it. More latched onto it, riding it. The bass is reserved but it’s got a bounce off the kick, that up-down-up-down a bit. The guitar--thicc with two c’s when Prince is on it--fill out a lot of the remaining space. And when it does, we get some stand-out moments for real. Classic Funk. And that against the synth-heavy moments, Frankenstein voices for real, the track is loaded, man. After all that we still get the long break, a little vocal vamp on it, layered still, some kicking around on the drums. Yeah man we get into party territory. As is expected Uptown. \n\n“Do It All Night” makes a stronger case for that real Funk. Earned Funk. Cements the Funk. It starts in the bass line, underneath some juxtaposed pieces, spacey synths and clean guitars, sultry lyrics and a punky riff on the keys against it all. Funk rhythms are deep in there. The key slides seem to hit just off-center from the bass line, and that line itself seems to wiggle just out of time when it climbs up. It’s a dance number for sure, with plenty of rhythm to latch onto. It’s subtle and I dig it. The Fonkiest shit though? “Head.” Yeah, man, that definition of the word. Yes. This man brings it heavy on this one. He tones down the synth voice to bring it a little more raw and we get that reflected heavy in the slap bass--those plucks got grit. And both of those are layered on a solid beat man. Prince can get reserved on the kit, a little more reserved than I like, and he does it here a bit too,  but the fills and the late handclaps fill out a nice, wide rhythmic base for the track. It sets up a solid break, and demands an absolutely bizarre, scatological, ecstatic synth solo--extraterrestrial, man. What a weird, funky track. \n\nLots of good funk and lots of great vocals across them. Great keys, filling out that Minneapolis sound. But it’s dirty, man. All the brightness and genius and it’s a filthy, filthy album. “It’s you I want to drive,” Prince basically moans in the opener, and he’s going to dance around it some more in the follow-up, “When You Were Mine.” “You let all my friends come over and meet” and “you didn’t have the decency to change the sheets.” DAMN. Cold. Filthy. And it’s Prince’s filthy mind, juxtaposing those lyrics and the bright, glamorous, keyboard-driven bop that is all him. Lead, backing vocals, synths, guitars (that clean guitar tone kills me more each listen), bass, drums. All him. The dirtiest, filthiest shit though? “Sister.” Yes it’s about that. It always is with Prince. (“Incest is everything it’s said to be.” Wtf man.) But after a solid, wide rhythm painstakingly established in “Head” he follows with a sprinted punk rock track with no stable time signature to it at all. Just pounding that clean guitar, bringing early punk into the mix with it. Five beats here. Seven on that. Two there. Four there. You can’t take it too seriously and you aren’t supposed to. Just shocks for the hell of it. \n\nBut Prince also brings it more sincere, downtempo, a little soulful. “Gotta Broken Heart Again” croons at you. It’s chill and it hits. It’s full, wider and more forward on the guitars than the rest of the album, really, and a valid complaint might be we want more of this sound on the album. Even one more soul track. The R&amp;B intonation in the vocal plays nice with those guitars. Layered vocals spinning out from the progression. It’s a cool track. The most straightforward one on here, maybe. \n\nThat leaves the closer. “Partyup.” Morris Day wrote this one. Prince wrote a bunch of Time tracks in return. It’s on the level. It’s another true Funk track. Not quite as thick with it, but solid, layered in the riff. The bass leans a little melodic on it, the keys are a little wider, the backing vocal is a reserved, the effects aren’t egregious (that cartoon effect adds melody now), but it’s still got grit to it. The chant. The breakdown. The range of percussion brought in. The slick riff between the guitar and the keys. It’s a deep groove, man. Deep in it you get a high-pitched pulse out of one side of the keys, and then that same element just shoots to the top loud leading into every verse. Prince brings punk to the table with his funk. And that punky vibe extends on this into one of my favorite moments in any song, the chanted outro: “You’re gonna have to fight your own damn war / Cause we don’t wanna fight no more.” Just a shaker behind it. \n\nSay what you will about feuds, egos, personalities, Prince is bringing poignant, punky, filthy brilliance inspired by greatness before him, and that includes the greatness, the filthy poignance, of Rick James immediately before him. Yeah he studied. Yeah he copped moves. Yeah he wrote half this record in hotel rooms immediately after watching Rick from the shoulders of his bodyguard. This is the great record born of all that. And it’s damn good, man. Dig it.",

    "title": "Rick James - Bustin’ Out Of L Seven (1979)",
    "content": "In 2004, Rick James became a proper introduction to funk for yours truly. And yes, it was Dave Chapelle’s “I’m Rick James, bitch!” that did it. From there into the world of internet piracy many went. “Super Freak” is estimated to be on 10% of mix CDs from the era. But for every second of irony the Rick James resurrection year produced, there were (and have been sense) hours of genuine excellence uncovered, revisited, enshrined. And Rick knew that would be the trade-off. He signed on to that infamous Chapelle skit. “Cocaine’s a helluva drug” was his line. It’s funny. It is. And in return for feeding the meme machine with that he got his name back in the culture, a few gigs with Teena Marie, and then the Teena duet at the 2004 BET Awards: “Fire and Desire.” Goddamn.\n\nIf you haven’t seen it, you should. I’ll put a link in the comments. Rick’s voice is rough. Years of hard living on it. But he’s in his element. All that soul. All that don’t-give-a-damn attitude. The showman is there. But the comeback wouldn’t happen. He’d pass before the end of ‘04. How much promise went unrealized? How many times? What does this have to do with *Bustin’ Out Of L Seven*? I don’t know. Do a time travel visual montage: it’s ‘04 and he’s killing the BET awards, before that it’s drug arrests and other sensational details on his record, before that it’s album flops, a lone dance hit, before that it’s *Glow*, praise, accolades, he’s smoking weed on stage in the 80s, “She’s super freak-kay,” before that it’s the early tours, Prince opening, and before that it’s this. 1979’s *Bustin’ Out of L Seven*. \n\nWe got there. So. “alright you squares, it’s time you smoked / Fire up this funk and let’s have a toke.” That’s the opening to the lead, title track—the big single—of this album. It’s a thesis statement, an argument of the power of the Funk to break you out of squaredom. It’s a party track too, Rick’s bass bopping around with a touch of wah on it, that wetness amplified by a deep, subterranean bass solo. The vocal range is meant for the singalong. The backing vocals (Teena among them) spoken. And the horns, man, the bigness, the brightness, it’s got that P-Funk on it. Rick’s doing a lot of the arranging on the horns with someone named Pete Cardinelli. I don’t know much about the dude. But together they bring the party on these horn lines. \n\nBigness is what Rick knows, even in his early work. The pace of the follow-up track, the  “High On Your Love Suite / One Mo Hit (Of Your Love),” has you at a full sprint. The bass and piano somehow keeping melody at that speed, and then crash off the guitar into a Fernando Harkless sax solo. He channels early funk with it. That JBs style. It’s dope. The percussion break—Shonda Akeem on the hand drums, steady vibraslaps, synth and echoes of those horn arrangements—those damn horn arrangements—you lose your spot in the groove, man, the whole outro. \n\nAnd of course the bigness of a Rick James album is half in the slow jams. On the a-side we get my favorite, “Spacey Love.” Rick summons it with a sub-two-minute “interlude” track that’s all lonely noir trumpet, distant dialog and lush piano. It’s a vibe. A woman’s voice comes to the top of the mix... chimes... drums, toms, stumble down into—yeah, there it is: “Spacey Love.” When Rick’s voice kicks in it’s all lift off, man. The piano. The drums fall out. The bass is Rick’s lead instrument. The effects on it are insane. And, oh, that’s Dorothy Ashby playing harp. It’s the perfect backdrop to the perfect R&amp;B pleading, gear dudes are gonna shift into a decade later, all baggy suits in the rain. Rick has the copyright on that. And the way he lets the piano and synth chords punctuate each syllable with a drop as the track grows... and Dorothy comes back on the harp on the side-b arena ballad: “Jefferson Ball,” too. Wide, piano chords at the open, big drums—almost sounding like a timpani back there playing opposite the softness of the harp and the backing vocals (Teena again among them). And the whole thing is delivered in this sort of swaying waltz, the bass swinging back and forth before punching into the chorus. It’s a big, wild moment that only Rick could pull off, and he’s brilliant for it you know? Putting a waltz-y ballad and some damn harps on a funk album... and “Jefferson” is the longest track on the album so it’s all earned, down to the sparse rap—Rick James vamping under Rick James talking to you, sensually. Then a long fade out. But not long enough. \n\n“Cop ‘N’ Blow” kicks off the b-side. It’s a dance track, flutes and handclaps and all, and Rick’s vocals get a bit of a workout on it too. The backing vocals sort of ride piano chords, but Rick brings range, especially in the chorus, sort of talking through some lines and then jumping right to the wail: “BLOW.” Harkless takes another solo here and it breathes a bit more—a little more jazz on it. Walli Ali takes a guitar solo right after and it sits side-by-side the percussion in the break and brings us somewhere totally separate. Some brand new disco space for just a minute. And he’s gonna bring us back here with the closer, “Fool On The Street.” Back to the dance floor and back with the flutes. This time a guitar wiggle under it. A bit of a rock oriented chorus. Rick is putting everything he’s got on this one, string arrangements, synths, layered vocals, it’s a lush song, which puts it back in that disco arena. And the kick drum knows it’s there, not quite a 4 on the floor but close, making it all the more whiplash when the Latin-tinged measures kick in, bridges and breaks and solos, then the horns lift us 10,000 feet and launch. Big choral vocal. Heavenly. Then back down to earth, percussion back in, Rick’s guitar soloing, the flute chugging along under the backing vocals, picking up the pace little by little, and the trumpet, man... Rick brought it all out for the closer and he leaves us with a skit. One last thing to bring to the track I guess. \n\nSo won’t you please, won’t you please / Tell me something good, tell me something bad / Make me feel happy, baby, make me feel sad / Do with me what you please, I’m begging on my knees. Dig this one.",

    "title": "Average White Band - AWB (1974)",
    "content": "In 1971, a bunch of struggling Scottish musicians who knew each other from home bumped into each other by chance at a Traffic gig in London. OK, not “struggling,” really. That’s the Hollywood version. Truth be told they were doing OK. Roger Ball and Malcolm Duncan, a.k.a. “the Dundee Horns,” were with a decent jazz-rock band called Mogul Thrash. Bassist Alan Gorrie and guitarist Onnie McIntyre were with a prog group called Forever More. Onnie and drummer Robbie McIntosh had done session work with Chuck Berry. But old musician friends reunite so what do you do? Set up a jam. No idea how Scottish prog dudes got there but the apocryphal story goes that the jam turned funky and a hanger-on at the session remarked with--hear the Scottish accent when you read this--“This is too much for the average white man.”\n\nHence the name. \n\nNo idea if that’s true, but it should be. This group would go on to catch their break opening for Clapton in ‘73 when Clapton’s then-manager signed them to Atlantic Records. And then, at Atlantic, they recorded this, their breakthrough: 1974’s *AWB*.  Now, before we jump in, respectfully: a band of white, Scottish, prog-rockers turned massive funk hit factory for a minute? That’s crazy, right? But it’s real. Now let’s get it. \n\nThe big hit in question on this, that one single we all know, is “Pick Up The Pieces,” and it’s mostly instrumental. It’s horn-heavy funk on a thick, JB’s-inspired guitar riff.  And the horns get it, finally get the light, in formation but not too tight. Hitting a groove opposite the bass line and going bright, resonant, big when it needs to. And the sax solo kills! Off those first vocals. The bass and keys open up the groove underneath it and it goes man, just whips you around. That’s Molly Duncan on the solo. Dope instrumental. Then the follow-up track (also the b-side on the 7” singles and posted here just yesterday I think), goes smoother, a little more soulful. “Person to Person” it’s called. I dig it. It’s slinky. The bass line plays this little chord and slides in the groove and I love that. The organ sort of mimics it in a few moments, plays opposite elsewhere. The guitar’s then in some third space. It’s a thick groove, man. The breakdown, that open-air drum into the tiptoe bass, that’s gonna seal it for me on this one. But it is on the smooth side, now. \n\nAnd that’s the thing that always strikes me about AWB and *AWB*. They hit different registers of “smooth.” Different lanes. Like they have range but the sensibility is in often in that same space. The opener, “You Got It,” leans smooth-jazz smooth. The bass line chugs rather than moves and the fills are wide. It’s keys and strings taking up the whole lane. The shared lead vocals are pure ‘70s mainstream rock. The horns are there but distant, fuzzy. More complementing the big easy rock vocal than anything. Robbie keeps a respectable groove on the drums and keeps us grounded. A track like “Work to Do” (the Isley cover) is gonna do the same on the horns but let the guitar do the chugging. The big rock vocal with those orchestra horns. It’s that smoothness, soulfulness in the AWB melodies. You recognize it. It’s there again in the bright, clipped guitars and soulful vocals on “Nothing You Can Do” and “Keepin’ It to Myself,” complete with bouncy little bass lines and intermittently swaying and rising horns. Again in “Just Wanna Love You Tonight,” that pure soul with the drawn chords, the vocals weaving and then locking in. \n\nThe smooth edge is their go-to, but it’s not their only speed. “I Just Can’t Give You Up,” moves at a real clip. It’s got some arena on it. Some 70s rock horns. Robbie’s drums cook on it and the guitar solo, Hamish’s solo, goes psychedelic. And got the love is cool funk (*woo!*), with Gorrie’s bass moving a bit and McIntosh’s drums really grooving man--just giving free lessons. The punchy fills from him make this track for me, but that bridge is a close contender too. Hamish Stuart takes the lead on this and the vocal kills, man. The way the bass plays inside the bigger belts is real cool, noodle-y. But then a little break and it sinks, the band drops away. The whole song is a vibe and you wish it was longer. \n\nThat leaves the closer. “There’s Always Someone  Waiting” starts on some “Doing It To Death” guitar work but it’s plodding now. Sparse at the open. All limping drums and staggered deep notes against the riff. I really dig this track. Gorrie’s vocal gets lead billing. The push-pull between the bass and guitar throughout sends me. The psychedelic effects kill me. The underwater vocal toward the end, man is bringing blues-rock, bringing Zeppelin to the table, it very cool. It’s gospel-tinged, punching up that JBs influence. Even when it locks in you get the sense that the vocal has to pull each instrument in to keep them falling off the sidewalk, you know? The break after the first chorus is where this song is made. Those high bass notes. The drawn out guitar wiggle. That’s where we really set the tone for the back half the track, which for a split second is going to sound like early Funkadelic. Just a second. Nothing serious. But you’ll give these dudes their laurels by the time the bass drops one last time and the needle lifts. \n\nThat’s a damn good Funk record. \n\nNow, a sad coda on this one is necessary. A month after its release, drummer Robbie McIntosh would die of a heroin overdose. 24 years old. But their follow-up album, *Cut the Cake* would be dedicated to him and be a major hit. And his drumming would be honored in a tribute track by the J.B.s. This is real: they released a single under the band name AABB, or Above Average Black Band, titled “Pick Up The Pieces One By One,” mimicking the original throughout.\n\nI dunno man. If the J.B.s wrote ‘em a tribute track there’s something there right? Right? Dig it.",

    "title": "The Isley Brothers - Showdown (1978)",
    "content": "In 1964, the Isley Brothers founded T-Neck Records out of a house in Teaneck, New Jersey. They were tired of label pressures and label business tactics (particularly around “Black music” at the time) and struck out on their own. One of the first things they did was settle on a slate of singles to release. One of which would be the gospel-infused “Testify,” featuring a then-unknown guitarist going by the name of Jimmy James. That single would go on to become iconic, mythologized even, as that guitarist would go on to become Jimi Hendrix. But that record didn’t chart then. In fact it wouldn’t be until ‘69 that T-Neck would look stable. ‘71, really.  No it was really ‘72 with Brother, Brother, Brother. \n\nOr actually it was ‘73. In ‘73 the Isleys took their rock-oriented, gospel-inflected funk and T-Neck’s entire distribution business to CBS. Then, starting with *3+3*, the Isleys dropped 6 straight platinum or multi-platinum records: *3+3, *Live It Up* (1974), *The Heat Is On* (1975), *Harvest For The World* (1976), *Go For Your Guns* (1977), and this one, 1978’s *Showdown*, #4 on the Billboard, #1 on the US R&amp;B. It’s an incredible record capping off an incredible run. And it included a deeply groovy, deeply dance-able, #1 single: “Take Me to the Next Phase (Part 1 &amp; 2).”\n\nLet’s talk about “Take Me to the Next Phase” though. The Isleys are carving out a brand of funk-rock that’s making a boogie turn here. And it does it all big. It’s a studio track designed to sound like a live arena in the opening. Cheesy, sure, but that desire to throw the bigness of a live show on this party track gets a nice echo in the foot stomps and hand claps in the back half of it. You get this implied 4/4 on the drums in those places too, as a result. It makes for a cool sort of down home, country feel. But truth be told it’s a track that’s sneaky in all it brings, man. We got a slinky, wiggly, layered bass line coming out of Marvin’s bass and Jasper’s synth. That synth voice borders on electro, too. Ronald’s vocals are pure rock n roll. The percussion here is steady but the drums are a little deep in the mix to make room for all the extras, the wood blocks and whatnot. The guitar carries a breakdown at one point and it’s pure twang. The flash is in the feel. There’s a bass solo later that’s so deep in the mix you gotta cave dive for the real notes. But the feel is enough. A critic would call it “understated.” I call it sneaky. \n\nAnd sneaky might describe the whole album. It snuck up on me, man. The opener, “Showdown (Part 1 &amp; 2),” brings one of the heaviest bass lines in funk. I’m talking metal. And it showcases that slap in a wild, extended outro under this shout-whispered backing vocal (“State your case / State your case”) and a real lonely clap.  But the rest of the track is dominated by a soft lead vocal and some complementary, maybe a little plodding, piano chords. That bass heaviness is echoed elsewhere too. “Ain’t Giving Up No Love” brings that same level of cosmic effects that an Ernie solo is going to blast back down to earth from late in the track. But at other points the bass uncouples from those things and lifts a pleading Ronald vocal up through a verse. \n\n“Coolin’ Me Out” takes the Funk a different direction. A little smoother, a little more soulful. I like Ronald in this setting. The woodblock on two and four. Kick the one. The guitar sparser with the piano doing some work. The bass sort of bouncing in sparse doubles. There’s nothing sneaky here. It’s a straight-ahead soul-funk groove with a fairly standard structure to it. Maybe an extra change in there than you might expect. Maybe the woodblock is an add-on. But it’s chill. Comfortable even. Even the vocal vamp at the end keeps its comfort zone. \n\nQuick aside to shout out the slow jam if you’ll allow it: “Groove with You” brings that classic guitar lick and Ronald’s smooth vocal, both riding on those keys. Something about the chord changes in here always gets me too. Like the structure is just off-center enough to pull me in. It’s a real cool song.  The second single to chart on this album and for good reason. \n\nBut *Showdown* is also a sneaky rock album. “Fun and Games” brings the rock n roll with soul. Standard 2-4 drumming, roots on the bass. Piano is felt. A bass solo is felt. More groove than flash here but still able to sneak a little extra in on the effects, cool outro vocals. More vanilla than most of the album but it’s not a skip by any stretch. And don’t worry: the other rock tracks are bigger. Heavier. “Rockin’ with Fire (Part 1 &amp; 2)” is quintessential late-70s. Driving bass under a busy funk riff, guitar and keys whipping us around and wide backing vocals moving us along, sort of walking beside the track. And Ernie’s drums punch at you for real. Clipped, little tommy gun fills. A key solo again deep in the mix (the most understated solos I’ve ever heard are on this album). One bridge brings it funky, lots of wrist in the guitar, but we’re 100% on the rock side of the Isley discography now, even in that bass break. You better be ready. It’s fire. And then it’s the closer, “Love Fever (Part 1 &amp; 2).” Ten minutes of guitar solo in a five-minute track. Ronald’s vocal is hair metal. The bass is ominous. The riff is juicy. The drum is incessant. The extended break toward the close is its own party in the back rooms of where main party is. It’s not psychedelic either. It’s not early Funkadelic rock n roll. This is post all that. It’s shredding. \n\nErnie can shred. And the Isleys can Funk. So come on. Dig this too.",

A childhood friend had a portable 8-track player with a bootleg tape that he played on a field trip. We were in the 5th grade. He knew the all the words to “P-Funk (Wants To Get Funked Up).” I was captivated. Mesmerized. \n\nLater, I’d come to know of Funkadelic, but it was via songs like One Nation… and (Not Just) Knee Deep. At the time I had no knowledge of their earlier work, and no understanding of the groups essentially being one and the same. Of course since then I’ve come to know and love the catalogs of “both.”\n\nWith all that said…for you, which entity of this amazing group do you gravitate to more? If forced to choose, do you take the more rock influenced, more psychedelic stylings of what was originally the backing band of the Parliaments? Or are you more of a fan of the group behind the P-Funk mythology, that dropped the Mothership Connection and subsequent LP’s?",

    "title": "Grover Washington, Jr. - Soul Box (1973)",
    "content": "Jazz/funk drummer Billy Cobham served in the army during Vietnam with a dude named Grover Washington, Jr. I don’t know anything about their enlisted time but that’s where they met and where they connected as fellow musicians. Billy was drumming around New York before being drafted. Grover was playing sax in the Midwest with groups like the Four Clefs (Ohio) when his number was pulled. Cobham would be Grover’s intro to the New York scene in the late ‘60s, after their service ended, which led to his introduction to a bunch of New York jazz figures, including the soon-to-be-iconic Creed Taylor.\n\nAfter leaving the army, Washington worked his networks, freelancing around NYC before settling into a decent music career in Philly. He recorded with notable badass Idris Muhammad during this time, so he had a name, but it was slow going. But then he caught a break. That encounter with Creed Taylor in NY put Grover on a short list, and when another player balked on a recording date in Jersey, Grover got called up to take the spot. The resulting album was 1972’s *Inner City Blues*, recorded on a new soul-jazz imprint called Kudu. Idris is on that album. Bob James is on that album. It would spark a vibe in jazz that would later morph into “smooth jazz” by the 80s. It also kicked off a run of albums leading up to Grover’s big break in 1974 with the prolifically sampled *Mr. Magic.* \n\nBut right before the Billboard status, and at the peak of his jazz credibility, Grover assembled the master team for what, in my opinion, is his masterpiece: *Soul Box* (1973). Jazz heads, come on, look at the names on this: army buddy Billy Cobham is back for a track; Idris Muhammad is making the drive from Philly; Bob James is back for a third go with Grover and conducting the whole thing; Ron Carter sits in the whole session; Airto is here; Eric Gale—the most influential guitarist you’ve never heard of—is here. But enough name dropping, let’s go. \n\nKudu is explicitly a soul-jazz imprint. Not a smooth-jazz imprint. Soul. But the charges of “smooth” get some backing on this one, to be fair. I’ll keep it brief. The cover of Stevie Wonder’s “You Are The Sunshine Of My Life” is definitely in that “commercial jazz” arena. It’s nice. Good solo in it. But it’s pop. And the opening track, “Aubrey,” definitely sends us off into thoughts of Kenny G. There’s no harp credited but your ears hear it. It’s a beautiful song. Absolutely gorgeous as a piece of art. But not for this crowd.\n\nReal funk comes down heavy immediately after that, though. It comes in the form of an out-there, cinematic intro and then a FAT brass section—three goddamn bass trombones—drop “Masterpiece” on you. It clocks in at 13:20 so buckle up. It’s cinematic as hell, really on a prog soul kick and it’s going to beat the hell out of the low end to bring Real Funk to you. Unmissable Funk. Heavy funk. But one of the beautiful things about this side of jazz-funk is that the use of brass is punched up by a deep knowledge of horns and woodwinds. I mean the bass trombones in there, bassoons, flugel horns, four or five types of saxes, flutes. We get all the good of funk horn work—all the fun of the bigness and the rhythm play—but ears like Grover’s are combining tones in dozens of different ways as it goes. It’s not the second line tradition. It’s the classical tradition marched down the street.\n\nDon’t think it’s all experimental or whatever now. *Soul Box* brings Funk straight ahead, too. We get organ-driven funk in the side-d medley, Airto’s percussion driving the One while we pass a solo around a bit. There’s enough change in it to read “blues” before “Funk,” but the polyrhythmic bits are there—about halfway between the Blues Brothers and James Brown. But Grover here is also channeling all of Maceo in his solo, man. That twitchy upbeat, the long high note. Hot damn! And honestly a lot of “Masterpiece” is on this vibe too at parts—straightforward, pass-the-plate Funk on a bass loop and some keys.\n\nAnd there’s legit, swinging jazz too. If at times a little bluesy. The cover of Marvin Gaye’s “Trouble Man,” keeps that root chord and the funk progression but goes very soulful on top of standard, swinging jazz drums from Idris. It’s subdued, overall. The guitar solo is low in the mix in a real chill way. The talk between Grover’s sax and Bob’s piano is a real cool moment, a vamp-y dialog between them. The medley on the d-side (“Easy Living/Ain’t Nobody’s Business If I Do”) brings us some cool jazz at the top, too. Ron Carter’s bass riding the strings in little boppy fills. It’s a vibe for real. Waiting for someone to cut in with a “Daaarrrrn thaaaat dreeeeaam!” We head into a little soul/fusion territory from there—a little Weather Report action, that rock-guitar jazz—but it’s firmly in the jazz tradition in those spots. No doubt. \n\nWhat most stands out to me though—there are a couple ways Grover kicks tracks into a higher gear. One way is those big melodies I’ve sort of alluded to: choruses of voices, strings, horns, bass trombones, all crescendoing at once. Another is one that doesn’t get associated with Grover’s work enough and that’s the psychedelic freak-out. On *Soul Box*, Grover takes us there a couple times. First it’s small: Idris sort of tightening up and double-timing in “Trouble Man.” Then we go a little bigger: the slow, mournful build-up on “Can’t Explain,” the Billie Holliday cover. The horns riding in on that deep piano, and the guitar solo—gives me echoes of Funkadelic’s “Witches Castle,” honestly, but it crescendoes far away from that—moody, more mobile though, the sax wailing. It’s big, sure, but then… then it gets monstrous. “Taurian Matador” big. \n\n“Taurian Matador” is our closer and it brings the freak-out raw at the tail end. You get first Bob James going wild—like the metaphysical definition of ecstatic—and then Grover screaming into the earth, just wailing on it, erasing every ounce of big band, soul, R&amp;B he just played—launching it into space, the bigness, but in those final minutes he loops back again and again to Billy Cobham’s drums. Billy gets the writing credit on this track, in fact, and he’s bringing it steady. The track orbits him, as good funk should. And you can tell that’s Billy. And you can tell the music is coming back to that place naturally. It’s not an act. It’s his work. It’s funk. \n\nBilly brought Grover to us in the first place, after all. Go dig it, ya’ll.",

    "title": "Parliament - The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein (1976)",
    "content": "Funk upon a time, in the days of the Funkapus, the concept of specially-designed Afronauts capable of funkatizing galaxies was first laid on man-child, but was later repossessed and placed among the secrets of the pyramids until a more positive attitude towards this most sacred phenomenon—clone funk—could be acquired. There, in there terrestrial projects, it would wait, along with its co-habitants of kings and pharaohs, like sleeping beauties with a kiss that would release them to multiply in the image of the chosen one: Dr. Funkenstein. And the funk is its own reward.\n\nThat’s the story we’re told, anyway, the official story given to us at the open of Parliament’s 5th album—the one that made me fall in love with them—1976’s *The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein.* It’s a half-hour-ish of straight funk fire. And before you remark on the length, do you know how many the Parliafunkadelicment things dropped in that one year? *Dr. Funkenstein*, two Funkadelic albums in *Kidd Funkadelic* and *Hardcore Jollies*, and Rubber Band’s *Stretching Out*. Even crazier—all of that (plus more!) stemmed from a single September ‘75 jam session.\n\nLet’s get it. *Clones* a notable album on a lot of levels but two stand out off the jump. The first is the role of Fred Wesley, who joined the crew for their last outing—their first gold album, *Mothership Connection*—but took a real writer role on this, composing the bulk of the horn arrangements and leaving his stamp. And I have to describe it as regal, man. Brass pageantry, almost. The brightness, the forwardness. After that intro and a little bit of Bernie laying down the chords on keys, it’s Fred’s horns—him, Maceo, the crew—blowing it in. Providing all the commentary. Coming in hot off the bat and solidifying the breakdown in “Gamin’ On Ya.” By the vocal vamp—“People keep waiting on a change…”—the horns are part of the chord structure they’re so ingrained. And at the end of the day, that’s musically what this album is bringing. The last one introduced full band funk, every track, a complete funk record. This one is going to push around inside that structure, starting with figuring out all these horns—all the people in this crew—can do. \n\nThe second thing that makes this album stand out is how big the story, the mythology, the cosmic narrative of P-Funk is to the songs. We got mothership idea last time but now we’re building a cast of characters. The third track here, “Dr. Funkenstein, one of two singles charting on this album, is where a lot of that myth-building first becomes the obvious focus. “Swift lippin’ and ego trippin’ and body snatchin’.” Dr. Funkenstein is here! “Kiss me on my ego!” It’s a charismatic, self-aggrandizing, filthy, brazen track. It’s The Big Pill. Bootsy’s bass swinging wide with a fuzz to it, Garry Shider and Glenn Goins bringing character—bordering on cartoonish—in the elevated, cosmic interjections on guitar. The gang vocal sells it as the proper introduction to Dr. Funkenstein. The character. The voice. He’ll make your atoms move so fast. Expand your molecules. And in the background we see the crew building up new characters. A whole world. And then fade out.\n\n*Clones* doesn’t let you dwell on any one thing though. This is far from George’s show. And it’s that interplay between the mob and the character, and the mob winning out, that solidifies P-Funk tradition as Funk Tradition for the back half of the decade. They do it on the biggest song on the album: “Children of Production.” The layers on that track are insanity. Jerome Brailey, Bigfoot, drummer, formerly of the Chambers Brothers, is putting this one on his back. The intro is pretty straight ahead, but quickly he’s introducing a stutter-step into it, carving out the One rather than dwelling on it. Bigfoot lays it down steady, crisp, at various points giving each section of the crew room to talk to one another: horns answer keys, bass answers guitars, it rises up to a point where the bass and the horns are running in opposite directions and then they loop each other in, riding the hi hat. It’s intricate, woven together. Cool as hell.\n\n“Do That Stuff” and “Everything Is On The One” kick off the b-side and give us quintessential, platonic-ideal, heavy-on-the-drop funk. It’s all soaring horns, especially that medieval-sounding interlude in “Do That Stuff” and that bridge in “The One,” echoing that regal style that Fred cements all over the album. It’s that deep, rhythmic bass, not too flashy. Small flourishes. It’s color-commentary guitars and keys giving the back drop. The little key and synth vamps in “The One.” The chords with the reggae lean in “Do That Stuff.” It’s bizarre effects, a mess of backing vocals. It’s iconic chants. “Everything is on the One today ya’ll / and now it’s a fact / Eeeeevvvvvvvvv-ry-thing-is-on-the-One!” If James Brown was able to capture the party of the live show on record, Dr. Funkenstein is in the lab cloning it right here. \n\nThe deep cut for me—the one I keep coming back to though—is “I’ve Been Watching You (Move Your Sexy Body).” With Bootsy’s style evolving right around this release (Rubber Band is about to take off and Bootsy’s gonna go full psychedelic, full Hendrix), Parliament finds a good counter-point in Cordell Mosson’s comparatively reserved playing. The whole b-side is Cordell tracks. “I’ve Been Watching You” is a Cordell track. The bass bubbles underneath rather than soaring or claiming the spotlight. It’s a slow-burn track like so many Bootsy tracks tend to be—long, hypnotic breaks—but where Bootsy would drop a huge slide to the octave, or he’d kick on mad scientist levels of distortion or something, on “Watching You” we spread the spotlight out. It’s chill. It’s atmospheric. Driven by wide keys. Ecstatic backing vocals. And it’s given mostly to Glenn Goins, lead vocalist. Glenn is gospel, man. It shows.\n\nSo. Sorry. I lied. There’s a third thing that stands out with this album. It’s an approach to vocals here that’s really less about trade-offs and more about using the full force of P-Funk, bringing different configurations and different mash-ups out of the jam. We get it in Glenn’s bluesy, gospel-trained, soul vocals in “Watching You” and then again on “Funkin For Fun” right after. We get it on track 5, side A, “Getten’ To Know You,” there with a very cool Garry Shider’s vocal performance. Pure R&amp;B. That’s Garry holding down guitar and bass on this track too and it’s a peek at the kinds of melodies the funk mob would be able to grab at moving forward. The smoother, more soulful register, Bernie keeping the chorus afloat on big keys. The dual sax solo heading toward jazz. Piano solo heading jazz. It’s just that Motown bass keeping this thing on track. Range, man. These cats got range. \n\nThey couldn’t stop bringing new sounds, man. So dig every second of this one. Or does P-Funk frighten you, now?",

    "title": "A Taste of Honey - A Taste of Honey (1978)",
    "content": "In the early 1970s, bassist Janice-Marie Johnson and collaborator and keyboardist Perry Kibble joined forces as A Taste Of Honey. They employed a cast of guitarists and drummers and kept the group on a true grind—not just touring clubs in and around their hometown of LA, but jumping into the USO circuit. That military grind. Spain, Morocco, Korea, they were playing around the world not because they had the hook-up but because they put in work. They paid their dues. By 1976 they settled on their breakthrough lineup of Johnson (bass and vocals), Kibble (keys), Hazel Payne (guitar and vocals), and Donald Johnson (drums). Boogie warriors, the lot of em.\n\nBack stateside and playing LA clubs, this iteration of A Taste of Honey was signed by Capitol Records and sent to the studio. The rest, as they say, is a fierce piece of disco boogie history. That debut album was the self-titled *A Taste Of Honey* (1978), the lead single is the iconic “Boogie Oogie Oogie,” and though it would mark the beginning of the slow decline of Johnson’s and Kibble’s creative relationship, it also kicked off a sprint of disco-boogie ascendancy that make this crew and this album worth knowing and—if you have a pulse—getting down to. \n\nThere’s no time to waste (ooh), so let’s get this show on the road. “Boogie Oogie Oogie” is the quintessential boogie groove. It’s on a bit of a soul kick in the open—the hi-hat 16ths, the wah on the guitar, melodic, climbing, cinematic bass—so when the groove falls in on Donald Johnson’s kick drum, it’s whiplash. All the better for the trance to settle in. The keys are low in the mix and wide, more atmospheric than written in the track. The guitars here are getting a little highlight though. The wrist flicks are pure funk technique and the solo is this fuzzy, gnashing, ecstatic explosion that’s unmissable. The bass is doing that quintessential boogie bounce, so loud about it you almost get an echo of an “ooo ooo!” without asking. The break keeps it cool though. It boogies but it doesn’t get showy about it. Even as the lyrics demand your attention the track doesn’t make it a habit. It’s those vocals though—Janice-Marie and Hazel keeping it cool, slinky—that make this track. There’s no clipping, no rough edge, the girls let the lyrics bleed into the dance floor and fill it rather than move it. Airy. \n\nHoney grooves are deep though, man, and they don’t get talked about enough. The thickness in the bass alone on “Distant” grips you up. It stomps wide wide underneath some light, faint guitar scratches—a mess of piano fleshing it out—it’s insane. Then the strings come in right before a real cool breakdown, the guitar giving us old school, just a little wobble on the bass—confident, downplayed, counting it out. There’s real Funk on this, you can’t deny it. Janice-Marie even gives us a growl at the close just to confirm it. She knows it. You know it. It’s Funk. The riff on “You” swings wide too, carrying the dual vocal. It’s got more edge than most of the rest of the album here. The bass pops high, the keys layer and clutter up the space. There’s a bluesy side to Honey’s funk formula. It’s cool. It stomps. It’s worth groovin’ to today.\n\nBut hold up, because they stomp again on “Disco Dancin.” Heavy. The thickness of that bass, thump low and wiggle up, and the snaps on the intro. That’s hand drums underneath throwing the rhythm way back. This is gettin Funky now. A simple chord change. We’re building on it—that classic funk jam style. The keys bring the first change in and we lighten up just enough for the spoken vocal, a little growl, a little whine on it. Deep in the groove now. And catch that wah guitar deep in the mix. Holding it down. Then here comes the organ break, sliding between slick and ecstatic. But always cool. Then they step it down. A little James Brown influence there. They’re playing with the groove now. For the Funk of it, even. \n\nBut, yeah, we know A Taste of Honey for the duet vocal. That soft-yet-full vocal delivery, playful in the higher end, is the duo’s calling card. We see it in the high registers of R&amp;B tracks like “This Love Of Ours,” which delivers the softest expression of “baby” I’ve ever heard. Huh uh-huh uh-huh uh. How cool is that delivery right there? We see it iconically in “Boogie Oogie Oogie,” real airy in the chorus but just a twist of yearning in it. It’s not like Janice-Marie and Hazel work to sit in that space, you know? It’s just where they are. It’s a vibe only they can bring, so much so that even in the big, soulful feature on here—“If We Loved”—we’re still in it. Even in the funkier-edged (but very melodic) “World Spin,” we’re in it. But for me the best vocal feature is deep in the track list: “Sky High.” It gives us all the highs the ladies hit in “Boogie,” but with some space. There’s a bit of funkiness on the track but it’s at a tempo and a clip that hides it a bit in favor of chimes, strings, and other, airier elements in the keys.\n\nIt really is the whole bag on these softer tracks, you come to realize. The keys go wide and light. Chimes hit. The strings bring it big and soft. Credit to Wade Marcus for those arrangements. A little taste of that Philly-Soul-style refinement on the ballads. R&amp;B as a proper noun. So much so that even in a track like “World Spin,” that brings melodic funk but funk nonetheless—especially in that guitar—we can get overrun by a string arrangement and a traditional piano and turn R&amp;B on a dime. Instantly elevated. And the closer, “You’re In Good Hands,” ties a corsage on it—they bring in a whole damn harp. A harp. A harp!\n\nLots of ink is spilled over the arbitrary lines we draw between genres. And it feels all the more arbitrary the closer the genres get. But here I think we get a clue, right? Disco is bringing the elements of Philly soul to funk rhythms. The more those other elements smooth out the rhythm, the more disco it is. A Taste of Honey, with its vocals, tempos, string arrangements, soaring keys, gets pretty disco. But with Janice-Marie’s bass and Hazel’s guitar holding us down, there’s plenty of Funk to dig. \n\nSo go ahead! Dig it! Dig the boogie!",

    "title": "War - Platinum Jazz (1977)",
    "content": "War had Billboard’s best selling album of 1973. It was *The World Is A Ghetto* and it deserves that best-selling title. And through the 1970s, a post-Eric-Burdon-dominated stretch of funk-rock-jazz-fusion-world-folk-harmonica-blues madness, they retained well-earned status. After the #1-selling *The World Is A Ghetto* they followed up with *Deliver The Word* (#6) the following year and most notably with arguably their best-known album in 1975: *Why Can’t We Be Friends* (#8). It was a sprint of top-10 albums that, tragically, couldn’t sustain the departure from their label and the release of a dud, from-the-vault, Eric Burdon album. \n\nWar wouldn’t ever fully come back to form after ‘75 (and I actually like *Galaxy*) but there’s a brief moment in the late albums where they hit big one last time, in the awkwardly placed, contract-loophole-born, statement-driven, half-album, half-compilation, *Platinum Jazz* (1977). See, the decision to leave United left the door open for an album to be released on what was then a sub-label and today arguably the most well-known jazz label, Blue Note. Yeah, that Blue Note. And as weird a fit as it seems today, it was a no-brainer then. On the way out the door, and in the wake if their United-released Greatest Hits, War tossed around the idea of a “companion disk” that would focus on new instrumentals, and new instrumentals specifically written to showcase genre range. They’d do funk, jazz, rock, blues, folk, soul, the works. Blue Note, riding the wave of 70s popular jazz, took the bait. Then they expanded it into the two-LP version here. Two sides of new material, two sides of (re-edited) greatest hits, it would chart higher than *Why Can’t We Be Friends?* The audacity of the record buying public, really. \n\nThe greatest hits lineup we won’t dwell on. It includes, in order, from track C2 to the end, shorter versions of: “H2 Overture” (originally from *Deliver The Word*); “City, Country, City” (*The World Is A Ghetto*), “Smile Happy” (*Why Can’t We Be Friends?*), “Deliver The Word” (*Deliver*), “Nappy Head” (*All Day Music*), and a personal favorite, “Four Cornered Room” (*Ghetto*). If the assignment is “show range,” you can’t really fault that list much. “H2 Overture” and “City, Country” bring that real melodic jazz to the front—sharpening up in the sax solo but they could pass for a bigger Grover Washington track most of the time. “Smile Happy” is a known entity—a little more guitar work, a little more percussive, a folk-rock lean to it. “Deliver” brings the blues and the soul back. Downtempo. Heavy keys. One of the few vocal performances on the record. “Nappy Head” is the percussion showcase—very cool, very steady Latin groove. And “Four Cornered Room” is “Four Cornered Room.” Heavy, psychedelic blues—that harmonica sounding from Hades itself!—an all-time great track. Another time!\n\nThe new tracks are echoing—then stretching—a lot of these same sounds, too. The lead track, “War Is Coming,” pushes standard War percussiveness far. It’s got that Latin groove baked in, thanks to a whole army of drummers and clappers and various percussionists led by Papa Dee Allen, but B.B. Dickerson’s bass is pure, mid-decade funk. The play between a scratchy, rock n roll lead vocal from Lonnie Jordan and the crew of backing voices—the horn and flute fills sort of mimicking that volley—makes this mythologically big, a mountain on top that baked-in groove. It transcends any one influence and warns you: they’re coming. By the time we hit that southern-style breakdown, we’re hooked into something a little dark. “So, stand to fight or kill yourself right now / It’ll be one less motherfucker to kill / Skin shot, burned, stabbed, scorched, and torn / The pain is real you can’t ignore / War is coming.” What. The. Fuck? Fuck.\n\nWar doesn’t play.\n\nThey don’t play with funk. They don’t play with rock. They don’t play downtempo, soulful, jazzy either. “Slowly We Walk Together” carries the same morbid soulfulness as “Four Cornered Room” but the Latin grooves on their jazzier stuff is a presence here too. It makes for a cool feel, heavier on the horns (Charles Miller carrying 90% of the horns here), splashy on the drums, but the verses are real clipped. They’re messing with the space between Latin jazz and US soul. It can feel like bossa nova in some spots. “I Got You” leaves the Latin-fusion and the blues behind and goes for straight, airy soul. Coldness in the key stabs and a handful of solid, cinematic chord changes—it’s real cool shit. It’s got a slow burn to it. \n\nThe best one-to-one comparison is probably “Platinum Jazz” to “Smile Happy.” The brightness, the lean into 70s pop-rock. Here they take it higher and refine it with the piano (love the piano on this track, that’s Lonnie’s piano), widening out the chords, sometimes just hitting quarters to claim more space. When the vocal “oooooooo” comes in, we’re really off. It never gets cluttered, but every four measures it feels like a new instrument, new sound, or new rhythm is introduced—a true jam on tape. \n\nThe single off this though is truly “L.A. Sunshine.” This is my shit. I love the percussion in the intro—we’re back into classic War here. Steady, Latin grooves. The rhythm and the choral vocal throw it back to “War Is Coming” just a bit, but it’s bringing it straight, not so dire. Not quite so weighty. The delivery of “It’s a funky town” reminds us not to be too serious. This is a party track at its core. 12 minutes of it. And one thing I dig about War is in their extended breakdowns, because they’re so chaotic in the layered percussion rhythms, they lean into those vintage, steady, tight bass lines. We get basically two notes on the bass for the first 6:00. It’s a wave that War hits and when they do, it’s hypnotic in a way few bands reach for, let alone land. Their grooves are straight funk. No frills. So when we get, like we do here, a damn fine, laid back organ solo out of Lonnie, it pops, man. \n\nThe last new track for Blue Note, at the top of side C, is “River Niger.” It’s got the most R&amp;B-oriented groove of anything on this record, prior to the vocals kicking in. From there we’re back on an Afro-Cuban kick, again the bass sparse and groovy in B.B.’s hands—but it’s those big changes that make the song. It’s the ethereal “chorus” and the dirty, thick “verse” going to war with each other, really. And for that to be the last peek at new material before the retrospective on the four albums prior to this? It’s something. It’s showing off. It’s making a big claim about what they’re about with a flute solo. It’s cool as hell. \n\nThat’s what War is about. Pure musicianship. Virtuosic. Funky. Unexpected. Motherfuckin’ *heavy* when it needs to be. A whole jam. And you already dig it. So dig this, too.",

    "title": "Has anyone ever noticed that Sly Stone's vocals on Fresh (1973) are sped-up chipmunk style?!",
    "content": "While listening to *Fresh* this week, I finally realized why Sly's vocals on this record have always felt somewhat off-putting to me: they're sped-up! Sly must have recorded his vocal takes at a slower tempo and then sped up the tapes to achieve that unnaturally high-pitched, helium-voiced chipmunk effect (albeit with more subtlety than his successors George Clinton and Prince, who had lots of fun with this technique). However, when I searched the internet for any details about this, I couldn't find one official source, biographer, or critic who seemed to notice it. In fact, the only mention I could find was from an [old post on a Prince forum.](https://prince.org/msg/7/424518) It's mind boggling to me that this LP could have hid such a big secret in plain sight for 50 years!\n\nTo be sure of my hunch, I loaded tracks from *Fresh* into an audio program and slowed them down somewhere between 5% and 10%, until they fell into a lower key that I suspect might have been that of the original vocal take. You can hear the [slowed-down versions here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/w1rqveoe5nojs/Fresh_(slowed_down_version)). Lo and behold: suddenly these vocals sound like prime Sly, far more natural (although some of the female/backing vocals and instrumentals were evidently recorded at the higher tempo, because they can sound a bit sluggish in the slowed versions.) and I have a feeling this will be the version I listen to from now on—for me, Sly's voice seems to lose some of its personality and distinctive growl in the officially-released, sped-up versions.\n\nDoes anyone have additional details about any of this? Any connections to Sly associates who may be able to confirm? Do alternate versions (not the 1990s bonus track mixes, which are also sped-up) exist somewhere with Sly singing naturally?",

    "title": "James Brown - Revolution of the Mind (Recorded Live at the Apollo Vol. III) (1971)",
    "content": "In 1970, famously, Bootsy Collins and his brother Catfish left the JBs and their band leader, James Brown, after too short a stint. It’s its own story, but for today it’s a cool detail. Because with Bootsy and Catfish there was talk of a triple-album monster project recorded in Paris. Ambitious. Without them and with James relocating to Polydor, though, that plan was scuttled. What could have been, right? Not to be deterred, James got on up and returned home, to the Apollo. He invented the live album there in 1962 and ‘63. Again in ‘67 he returned. This would be the third installment, and it featured arguably the best lineup for James. Danny Ray as the MC. Bobby Byrd on organ. Fred Wesley on trombone and St. Clair Pickney on sax. Fred Thomas on bass. Robert Coleman and Hearlon Martin on guitar. John “Jabo” Starks and Melvin Parker on drums. \n\nLet’s get into it. I wanna get into it. Can I get into it? It’s 1971’s *Revolution of the Mind (Recorded Live at the Apollo Vol. III)*. It’s a double album of straight funk fire. It’s further proof that James not only invented the live album, but perfected it. No one was capturing fire like James and it would be a couple years before anyone would challenge him for that crown. \n\nWe capture, first, the massive bravado of our MC, Danny Ray—who went uncredited on early versions of this. Dude sets the tone perfectly: “I’d like to know, are you really ready for some super dynamite soul?” And then it’s every superlative in the book: “Mr. Please Please himself!” “Mr. Dynamite!” “The #1 Soul Brother!” “The hardest working man in show business!” And we’re off. Turned loose. You can hear James chase the mic for the first few verses but with a smile on his face. Pure confidence. It’s not controlled chaos, every beat, every note, every stab of the horn, is pre-planned. It might be running at a clip *you* can’t keep up with, but James—Mr. Dynamite?—he’s good. \n\nThat opening sprint is a little track titled “It’s A New Day So Let A Man Come In And Do The Popcorn.” Insanity. No it isn’t. This man is fully in control of his capacities. He’s gonna kick us in on a showtime-y R&amp;B feel and then let a thick-wristed guitar kick us into the track proper. James is running the whole time, but he ain’t even short of breath. “It’s A New Day So Let A Man Come In And Do The Popcorn” isn’t even the fastest sprint James is gonna bring. That goes to side C, track 2, “Medley (I Can’t Stand It, Mother Popcorn, I Got The Feelin’),” and it’s showy. I have no idea how they cut in so precise with it. But when they take off you can hear everyone except Fred pushing it. He’s still cool. He’s got a bounce in the bass. He’s letting some notes ring. But “Feelin” kicks in, and we’re up a notch now. Now Fred is at a sprint with everyone else. It’s another moment—like “Super Bad” a few tracks later—where James is giving the perception of the wheels falling off when he knows damn well it’ll never happen. (That guitar work in “Super Bad” is some of the best technique I’ve ever heard, fwiw.)\n\nI don’t even know. No skips on this one. “Sex Machine” is here to close out the a-side and it’s where the stage banter and back-and-forth between JB and the J.B.s starts to round out. That opening is iconic—the “Can I get into it?”—but the vocal traded between James and the backing vocal is where the track is made. It’s a full stage jam by the time they’re calling in the bridge. And that bridge, man, that guitar starts throwing punches at the bass line. You can hear those two circling each other. Side-stepping. And the horns are crazy on point. When we get into the later verses with that guitar vamp, then the breakdown with that little, bubbly bass line, “Shake your money maker, shake your money maker,” how can you not?\n\nAnother iconic piece: the blend into “Make It Funky” from “Escapism,” a track that is probably best known for the St. Clair sax squeal that lives on in hip hop infamy. The breakdowns in these two tracks cement this thing—this performance, this album—as legendarily funky. The stage banter, the One on each change just surgical, man, and those solos! There’s a little extra jazz on the “Escape-ism” sax solo that I absolutely love. It’s a dimension of the JB performance that isn’t often part of the lore (despite St. Clair being there for 35+ years, and despite the J.B.’s albums featuring it heavy). But the banter is. Minutes on minutes of “Where you from?” punctuated with dance breaks. And the bass ain’t movin. Even at the bottom of the mix, surgical. \n\nLet’s talk about the Soul Brother moments too. “Bewildered,” the play between the “hot pants” banter and the ladies in the crowd leading into it is insanity, first of all. No it isn’t. It’s all calculated. He knew how to deliver that line to get the screams in the exact right place and pitch. Hit me now! Someone once asked how we define “R&amp;B” and the popular answer was “baby making music.” The best R&amp;B on record then is the silences in the back half of “Bewildered.” And “Try Me”? Again man, it’s like the crowd is an instrument for James. He punches the screams up in the mix and he keeps them there. Listen to the right version and you can hear em sing. But the screams as he rides the organ, the drop into the waltz—Fred Thomas is the only bassist in the world who can make a waltz funky—and the breathlessness of the delivery when we come out. Gorgeous. And right then he’s gonna let the ladies scream for him once more. \n\nBut I want to spend some time with “Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved,” and “Soul Power.” Big, groovy corner of the album. “Get Up” is split into Pt. 1 and Pt. 2., and “Soul Power” is given its own track, but it’s really one big, blended medley. We start in Pt. 1 trading a screamed vocal: “Come on come on!” It’s a big track at the start: I think the loudest horns we get in the mix, coupled with some keys, and the bass spreading out a little, throwing accents around more than we hear elsewhere. It’s full, man, at least until a lighter guitar-focused break. Then we come out of that with a JB scream and then, again, James letting the crowd be an extra instrument—they’re the whole backing vocal now. And we’re singing “Soul Power” mid medley. The groove on this thing is thick. The bass on a fuzzy monotone in the whole verse. That guitar doubled, wide. The horns really marking measures more than anything. It’s the most hypnotic groove on this thing, for me, and you hear it bounce on stage. \n\n“Power to the people! Power to the people! Power to the people!” Maybe that’s where this one should have ended. What a statement that would have been. But nah we’re closing with “Hot Pants (She Got To Use What She Got To Get What She Wants).” The duality of man. \n\nThere’s more. “Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose” is a deep cut with amazing crowd work, a thick guitar riff and… But yeah… I kept you long enough. “Hot Pants” is on the turntable as I type this. The man was obsessed. Goddamn. So go ahead and get up. Get into it. Give it up! Dig Soul Brother #1! Soul Brother #1, ladies and gentlemen! Mister! James! Brown!",

    "title": "The Gap Band - The Gap Band II",
    "content": "In 1974, the Wilson Brothers—Charlie, Ronnie, and Robert, out of Tulsa, Oklahoma—went into the studio to record their first album. They were going as the Greenwood, Archer, and Pine Band and, thankfully, would shorten that to “Gap Band” before finishing their debut, *Magicians Holiday*, on Shelter Records. It’s not great. Didn’t splash. It lighter fare than we’d want from who we know they are. So in ‘77 they returned to the studio, but now they’re with RCA, and they tried again, dropping the first of two self-titled albums: *The Gap Band* (1977). This one doesn’t hit either. No chart data to speak of. But they have some clout now. Chaka Khan appears on that album. They’re making a name. \n\nTheir live show catches the eye of Mercury. They get a new record deal. They’re digging this P-Funk sound heavy and they bring that influence and that energy into the studio. Forget the last album. *This* is the self titled. This is *Gap Band* (1979) and they’re gonna drop hits: “Baby Baba Boogie” charts on disco. “Shake” peaks at #4 on the R&amp;B chart. They made it, right? Nah. Hold up. That same year, leading up to the release of the album I’m talking about here, 1979’s *Gap Band II,* they dropped the bomb: “I Don’t Believe You Want To Get Up And Dance (Oops).” We’ll call it “Oops.” You’ve heard it, at least a sample. And some subset of y’all will have chanted this at an opposing team. “Oops, up, side ya head…”\n\nPrime Gap Band is best looked at as P-Funk for the dance floor—at least that’s what my ears tell me—and that’s praise. At least that’s what we start seeing in the ‘79 self-titled, and we get it in “Oops” loud. That unison, gang vocal at the open: “Oops, up-side ya head, say oops upside ya head!” Cool as hell. They give you marching orders. Then the kick, the bass, the monologue. Between those elements we get both sides: a danceable, disco base with P-Funk sensibilities at the front. We get multiple, direct P-Funk references, too. “The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill!” The dirty “Jack and Jill” rendition (vocals are all Charlie, by the way). A reference to “WGAP” radio. All that insanity and underneath, the kick on 1-2-3-4, the claps on 1-3, the bass line cementing The One. This track is 8 damn minutes and that’s about 8 too short. Those horns too—directly lifted from the Brides of Funkenstein’s “Disco To Go”—P-Funk as hell. (Malvin Vice on the horn arrangements.) And it’s that slip between the heavy funk and the danceable, the R&amp;B charts and the disco, that defines these dudes and *Gap Band II.*\n\n“Steppin Out,” the opener, leans into that disco, that mono-rhythm a little harder. It fits the tune, though: high steppin, low steppin, rock steppin, roll steppin—it’s a workout. The kick and the clap on that 4 x 4, the tempo drop when the backing vocals ride in—the high, modulating “ooo ooo” should be iconic. It’s a song that plays with tempo more than rhythm. We can catch the bass maybe moving the most with that play. That’s Robbie’s bass shifting around from melodics to cutting eighths to big drops on the one. Man is low-key conducting the track from somewhere in the middle of the mix. “Party Lights” is on that dance kick too, claps and all. The party vocal even in the mix with that plucky guitar riff (all studio musicians on the guitars here so I can’t be sure), the drums marching us through—clap clap! And when the late verses kick in we get a cool layering of the vocals, matching the layering of the guitars. It’s a cool bit of busy-ness in what’s otherwise a straight-ahead, on-the-floor dance track. \n\nAnd the downtempo jams, man. “No Hiding Place.” Charlie’s vocal is on point. Clean. Refined in an R&amp;B sort of way a lot of funkateers won’t reach for. The horns on this are pure R&amp;B too. Shout out to the drum team on this one, Ronnie Kaufman and Ray Calhoun. These dudes saw an opportunity on this track and took it. The piano needs a nod too—here and a few places in fact. That R&amp;B sound is even clearer on the other side of the record, on “You Are My High.” Damn beautiful, that one. I mean gorgeous. Do yourselves a favor. Incredible engineering on the keys and synths. Charlie’s vocal killing it again. And then is that a… a timpani? Strings? Well shit. This is the kind of track you stage with a full orchestra, at least have to imagine it that way. The coolest downtempo track is the one that’s most out of place: “The Boys Are Back In Town,” the closer. That’s more pop-rock than anything else. The chorus with the backing vocal (“La lalalaaaa lala lala”) feels familiar. Not comfortably familiar but you get where it’s coming from. The hard downbeat is cool. The guitar solo is super smooth—love that bit—but yeah it feels just out of place enough in their discography sonically that you’ll either think it makes the album or wonder why it was included at all. I love it, personally. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, we get Big Ol’ Funk moments, a good bit of real funk, around here too. “Who Do You Call,” the opener of the b-side, is worth lettin marinate for a minute. This one especially takes us on a heavy P-Funk kick,  that synth’d-out intro, the fade in of the horns. I’m pretty sure there’s a drum machine deep in the mix. And that slappy bass at the open thinning out to just a few notes in the verse—second time in as many posts I want to accuse someone of trying to chase or one-up Bootsy. The slight rhythm shift into and out of the chorus—staccato horns all over it—and the play between the lead vocal (Robbie’s now, his bass too) and the vocals in the chorus reaching up and killing the melody. It’s heavily layered, cinematic, a little tongue-in-cheek, and covered in heavy drops. The backing singers get in on those drops at one point with a big “HUH.” It kills. The track demands a big break but stops about a half step short of it for my taste—we just sort of fade out on it. You can imagine a 12” version running 7:00 or 8:00 even. This track could have gotten that “Oops” treatment and I’d still ask for seconds.\n\nSo come on now. Get to high-steppin, low-steppin, rock steppin, roll steppin, and roll on down that floor! Dig it! Ooo oooo! Ooo ooo!",

    "title": "#1 Funk hits from the Golden Age",
    "content": "For me the golden age of funk runs from 1967 (when JB released Cold Sweat) until 1975 when disco's four on the floor kick drums and mechanical hand claps start to take over. Obviously, there's a lot of great funk after that, but I love the more complex funky drum tracks that were common during this era.\n\nRecently, I looked at all the songs that reached #1 on Billboard's R&amp;B/Soul charts from 67-75 and put together a Spotify playlist of the 57 songs that I consider funk. It's interesting to hear the evolution from James Brown, the Isley Brothers, Kool and the Gang and others to the disco era. \n\nUnfortunately, A lot of great early funk bands never topped the charts (The Meters are one glaring omission), but I still found it enlightening in some ways. I even uncovered a song or two that I didn't know.\n\nI'm not allowed to share the playlist on this sub, but feel free to DM me if you are interested. I've listed the songs in a comment below.",

    "title": "Graham Central Station - Ain’t No ‘Bout-A-Doubt It (1975)",
    "content": "Every source on early Sly and the Family Stone albums goes to some length to write about the true collaboration that you can hear in the songs themselves. Sly was the leader, but each member of the Family brought their own voice to the product and was given the space to say what they felt needed saying in that moment. We hear it especially in the passed vocals. “Hot Fun In The Summertime” gives us Rose’s “I cloud niiiiiine when I want to” and Larry’s so-deep-he’s-bringing-us-down-south “A country fair in a coun-treeee siide.” In “Dance To The Music” we have Cynthia’s infamous command—like your mom telling you to stop poutin and—“Come on. Git on up! Dance to the music!” Sly with the “Riiiiiide Sally, ride!” and Larry again: “I’m gonna add some bottommmmm, so that the dancer just won’t hiiide.”\n\nThat’s the iconic shit. The kind of moments lost when band members start walking off. Larry was one of them, the ones that walked. And we know Larry, the slap-bass legend, the “and that’s when I became the first to thump and pluck, together” mythology. I love this man. But what strikes me is that when you listen to his post-Family work, it’s not just a fuzzy thump-bass showcase. Nah. In fact, there’s a moment on this album, 1975’s *Ain’t No ‘Bout-A-Doubt It*, and specifically its biggest, most iconic track, “The Jam,” where you hear Larry and his new crew—Graham Central Station—paying homage to Sly and that collaborative spirit, goin’ ahead, passing the vocal to the whole team.\n\nThe first voice you hear on the monster funk track that is “The Jam,” the first voice you hear on this breakthrough album, isn’t Larry’s. (Ok well technically it is but the first lyric isn’t.) It’s Robert Sam’s. Butch’s. Almost Stevie-Wonder-like. “On organ… Playin’ on the organ, y’all…” and from there we’re off. Like he saw perfected with the Family, Graham has his crew showboating one by one, introducing themselves, and returning to the thickest, furriest, beast of a bass line. I mean we get a monstrous guitar solo (David “Dynamite” Vega), a wild, seemingly-four-handed clavinet riff (Hershell “Happiness” Kennedy), the f-u-n-k box (Patryce “Chocolate” Banks) giving us a taste of a breakdown—well, look the drum piece is racist alright? Like we don’t have to argue. Questionable then. Bad taste now. Move on—and the the big man himself—Larry—shouts in his own bass. What do they call him? Who cares. He shreds a bass in a way I didn’t think possible before I heard it. And when you think he’s done? Time to make it wobble for a minute. It’s the session on tape, man. It’s the platonic ideal of the jam. It is. It’s “The Jam.”\n\nGraham Central doesn’t play. That open tells us that they’re about to do everything twice as big as you’ve ever seen it done. Bigger bass in the mix. Wider organs. Big solos. Big, soaring R&amp;B vocals like we see on “Your Love” (the highest charting single from the album). I mean that track shows you: we’re going 70s R&amp;B but going bigger, brighter, taking the solo a little long. The outro a little long. Adding one more layer of vocal in the melody. And later we get a big swing at some softer, psychedelic blues in “Ole Smokey.” That’s a deep track. All organ, all piano, all Larry on the vocal—my favorite vocal of his on the album by a mile—and that trumpet. It’s a tight song, but going all in on that vocal makes it a statement. We get a couple big swings at different rock lanes, too. The closer, “Luckiest People,” is a big piano ballad. The choral vocal sells it. “Easy Rider” is much more in the funk rock lane—bluesy open, driving riff. He keeps coming back to that piano, doing something cool with it. That blues edge gives him other tools to do something monstrous. It’s in the horns. The piano. The guitar solos. \n\nWe get big ol’ Funk too. The Funk, even. In the admittedly cheesy “It Ain’t Nothing But A Warner Brother’s Party” (dope track, cheesy concept) which passes the vocal again, Family-style before a massive group scream, but overtop an avalanche of keys (that piano!), splashy drums, a real animated bass line from Larry, and some big, almost-bluesy brass. The outro on that is pure big-time blues showcasing. It’s wild. That 100% pure non-GMO Funk pops back up in “Water,” appropriately wet in those bass pops. A deep groove on this shit—the bass fills the only marker of time, the wide vocal melody blurring the count almost. That middle break is the funkiest silence I ever goddamn heard, man, and then we’re back at it. \n\nThere’s some movement toward the early-electronic here, a vibe he’ll enhance a bit on 1978’s *My Radio Sure Sounds Good To Me*, but that’s for another day. Back here, the bass tone in “It’s Alright” wears it loud. That deep wah—the guitar jumping off it a bit, the keys too. That circular break they come back too, a little messy, a little jazzy, hides it for a minute but there’s some reach for the sounds there. Larry’s bass can carry it. It’s cool when he breaks from the fuzz for something else. If you dig this corner, dig *Radio* too. \n\nBut after “The Jam” there’s really one track I want to talk about. Goddamn. That cover of “I Can’t Stand The Rain.” The Ann Peebles. Or maybe you just know the Missy sample. Or maybe you know another version. But you got to know this one. That sparse open on the toms—almost muffled. It’s like a stomp at a distance, creeping in. And then the drive when the kick and Larry’s bass dig in unison is *heavy*. But the time Larry hits a slide, a pop, a chord, we’re riding that march forward. The organ here is wide too, man. A whole wave. Dynamite’s guitar solo? Weeping. That absolute belt of a vocal from Chocolate… the hell they let anyone else sing on this album for?… then it’s out… just the backing, soft, then we kick back in and the mix itself even gets bigger, louder toward the close. It’s like Larry walks the volume up with his bass. Then out. Snap. Snap. Snap. Rain. Snap. Snap. Rain against my windoooooow… Kick. Kick. Kick. They’re milking this one for everything. And you’re here. Ecstatic. Entranced on it. Then they run it back!\n\nSo come again another day. Another day. Dig this one. You need it.",

    "title": "D'Angelo's comeback and Black Messiah",
    "content": "# D'Angelo's comeback\n\nShortly after the release of the neo soul masterpiece *Voodoo* (2000) to widespread critical and commercial success, singer/songwriter D'Angelo began to grow uncomfortable with his fame. The release of the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxVNOnPyvIU) for **Untitled (How Does It Feel)** skyrocketed his status as as sex symbol, something he quickly grew to resent. The music video, along with the death of a close friend, marked a shift in D'Angelo who very quickly removed himself from the public's view.\n\nFive years after the release of *Voodoo* D'Angelo had developed an alcohol addiction, estranged himself from his family, his girlfriend had left him, and was getting into trouble with the law. [The mugshots of him](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rb-singer-dangelo-allegedly-busted-trying-to-pay-40-for-a-prostitutehow-does-it-feel/) became a topic of conversation in the public, as D'Angelo had noticeably put on weight, contrasting his *Voodoo* days and brief stint as a national sex symbol.\n\nThis whole time, D'Angelo had been making music. He starting obsessing over his next album. He wanted total control, including playing all instruments. He pushed himself to become proficient with countless instruments. He started obsessing over music equipment and learning the ins and outs of music production. The songs he was making were described as \"Parliament meets the Beatles meets Prince\", but were also unfinished. D'Angelo was inundated by many factors: the expectations for following up *Voodoo*, his growing resentment of the public and his image, and his worsening addiction issues.\n\nEventually, D'Angelo pulled himself from the hole he found himself in. He went to rehab in 2005. He started appearing on other albums as a featured artist. He even started finishing songs. In 2007, 7 years before the official release of the album, a few parts of a song called **Really Love** were[ leaked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxMYh9TwEbs) by D'Angelo's collaborator Questlove. ^(Sidenote: I don't think Questlove has ever said WHY he leaked it, but I assume it was because he was frustrated with D'Angelo for not releasing the song himself.) The reception of the sections were positive, and this helped D'Angelo push past his habit of not completing songs as he formed **Really Love** into the first true single of the upcoming album.\n\nD'Angelo also dialed back his need for control, and formed a solid group of collaborative musicians to help with the album, namely: Questlove (drums), Pino Palladino (bass), Isaiah Sharkey (guitar), and Roy Hargove (horns). While working on the album by himself, D'Angelo found it difficult to get out of his own head and finish music. For years he was workshopping songs and ideas on his own, but within a few months of jamming with this group, he was inspired to finally put out some music for the public (who he's had a rocky relationship with). ^(Second side note: You probably haven't heard of) [^(Pino Palladino)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pino_Palladino)^(, but he's one of my favorite bassists of all time. Look at his work as a session musician and tell me you aren't a fan.)\n\nBy 2011, Questlove claimed the album was 97% complete. D'Angelo had planned to slow-roll the official release, and spent a couple years promoting it by touring and performing the new songs. He wanted to release it in 2015, but released it a year early after controversy surrounding the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. And thus, *Black Messiah* is released in 2014, 14 years after *Voodoo*.\n\n# Black Messiah\n\nMusically, the album is dense, warm, and funky. The musicians are all completely locked in and in pocket, yet somehow relaxed and improvisational. The whole album was recorded on vintage equipment (without any modern technology or plugins) and has a very tactile sound, like you could reach out and touch it. In a digital world this album stands out as wholly analog. The reverb, echo, compression... none of the effects were digital. *Black Messiah* is intentionally filled with \"imperfections\": Unintended distortion, ambiance, offbeat playing. All of this leads to a sound I can only describe as **authentic**.\n\n* **Ain't That Easy** kicks off the album with a wiiiiide open funk groove accompanied by heavy layering of both D'Angelo's signature varied vocals, and Sharkey's intricate guitar work. Seriously, put on some good headphones and listen to the last half of the song and try and focus on the guitar layering. So cool.\n* **1000 Deaths** is an abrasive psychedelic funk rock jam that would make George Clinton proud with it's thumping, hypnotic beat.\n* **The Charade** is a heavily political, ethereal rock track with haunting vocals low in the mix. The fuzzy guitars and sharp snares build to a beautiful culmination.\n* **Sugah Daddy** leaves the politics and turmoil at the door. It's just pure FUNK. The groove is composed of a piano, hand claps, and bass. At first listen it can seem unfocused, but in reality it's one of the tightest grooves of the century. Also has some crazy lyrics...\n* **Really Love** is a soft swing neo soul track with beautiful harmonies, a lush string section, and Latin influence.\n* **Back To The Future** is more stripped down but brings the funk back, highlighted by a steel drum-like sitar, tight guitar licks, chugging bass, and some pristine string sections.\n* **Till It's Done (Tutu)** is a dreamy groove-driven track about perseverance in the face of existential issues.\n* **Prayer**'s sleazy fuzz guitar contrasts with a church bell to make a meditative and soulful plea to God.\n* **Betray My Heart** would feel at home at a smokey jazz club.\n* **The Door** takes inspiration from vintage southern blues with its harmonica, shakers, and whistling.\n* **Another Life** is the best Prince song he never made. The climax of the song is unreal, and serves as a perfect ending to the album.\n\nEvery song is supported by a foundation of amazing musicians who contributed (along with D'Angelo's own instrumental contributions and of course his top notch vocals), and you can tell that their jam sessions heavily inspired the finished product, which somehow kept the feel of a vintage funk record while still feeling fresh.\n\nAs you can imagine, the album is heavy with themes of the Black experience: social justice, police brutality, racial identity, systemic oppression. *Black Messiah* is often compared to the Sly &amp; The Family Stone album [There's a Riot Goin' On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_a_Riot_Goin%27_On) thematically (and sonically) and for good reason. Both are quintessential Black American protest albums. *Black Messiah* does a great job at communicating the anger and frustration that many Black Americans felt at that moment in time, and still feel (\"All we wanted was a chance to talk, 'stead we only got outlined in chalk\"). If anything, the frustration and disillusion the album portrays has only festered since its release. The name \"Black Messiah\" at first may seem like a very self-obsessed thing to call your comeback album, but in fact the name is supposed to convey the idea that anyone can find the power to change the world. It almost demands you to listen to the album in context of the social climate of our time.\n\nThe album also tackles D'Angelo's personal issues. It touches on his personal growth and how he's changed since *Voodoo* on **Ain't That Easy** and **Back To The Future** (\"So if you're wondering about the shape I'm in, I hope it ain't my abdomen that you're referring to\"). He dives into the vulnerability and anxiety of love on multiple tracks like **Really Love** and **Another Life**. He uses Christianity as a lens for Black empowerment and collective action (**Prayer**). Environmental pollution and existential dread seep their way into **Till It's Done (Tutu)**. Even in the moments of levity, the album almost always conveys a sense of frustration and anger. It's not a light album by any means.\n\nFinally I'd like to just add in what Questlove had to say about *Black Messiah* and D'Angelo before the release.\n\n&gt;\"\\[It's\\] like the black version of [*Smile*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(The_Beach_Boys_album)) – at best, it will go down in the *Smile*/*There's a Lot Goin' On*/Miles Davis' *On the Corner* category. That's what I'm hoping for. There's stuff on there I was amazed at, like new music patches I've never heard before. I'd ask him, 'What kind of keyboard is that?' I thought it was some old vintage thing. But he builds his own patches. One song we worked on called 'Charade' has this trombone patch that he re-EQ'd and then put through an envelope filter and then added a vibraphone noise on top and made a whole new patch out of it. He's the only person I know that takes a Herbie Hancock approach, or Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff—the two musician/engineers who programmed all of Stevie Wonder's genius-period stuff—approach. That's the last time I ever heard of somebody building patches. We'll see if history is kind to it.\"\n\nTL;DR: After 14 years, *Black Messiah* more than lived up to the expectations set by *Voodoo*. It was an instant classic, and has placed D'Angelo among the greats of funk music. The album serves as the perfect mix of vintage familiarity and innovation, and is a landmark in modern music.\n\nWhat do you think about *Black Messiah*? Or D'Angelo? Or his comeback?",

    "title": "Dazz Band - Jukebox (1984)",
    "content": "In 1982, we had a somewhat-rarified instance of funk winning a Grammy. Do we care about statue-chasing? No. But those moments when The Funk—either in pure form or Trojan-horsed in a pop act—shake up the “main stream” should be celebrated. It’s suspect, but we should celebrate it anyhow. The band was Dazz Band. The track was “Let It Whip.” The award was for male R&amp;B vocals. If you’ve heard Sennie “Skip” Martin sing you know it was earned. “Let It Whip” wasn’t pure Funk but it’s funky. A funky dance track with some hip hop production on it. But if that track brings it correctly, the album as a whole? Funk tracks Trojan-horsed in pure, baby-soft R&amp;B. That’s not a pejorative—I love a soaring vocal on a slow jam. That’s my shit.\n\nBut Dazz Band’s Grammy win was in fact just the peak of an incredible, chart-sweeping streak of albums for Motown, all produced by jazz-funk keyboardist Reggie Andrews, all featuring Skip’s massive voice, and all taking the band to different corners of funk, disco, R&amp;B, soul, electro, and more. Give it where it’s due: from ‘80 - ‘84 they never coasted on a formula and made a bunch of big, dance-funk anthems, all the way through to this one: 1984’s *Jukebox*.\n\n*Jukebox* is labeled “disco” a lot of places—including the crates of the seller I bought this copy from—but that’s a misnomer. What it is is actually electro-funk with medium-sized breaks but a great ear for synth tones and percussion. It’s dance music produced in such a way you can almost hear the label saying “yes please sample this shit.” And you hear it all over the metallic percussion of the opening track, the big single: “Let It Blow.”\n\n“Let It Blow” was the highest charting effort in the UK for Dazz. And if you know much about the Brit-funk movement of the mid-80s, you know that means we’re looking at heavily electrified, warped keys, with a touch of piano on a dance beat, soft R&amp;B vocals, a bit of new wave. There’s, like, the prototype for the 2000s stereotypical “rave bass drop” on here. It’s all over the dance map and the breaks are massive, wide, sometimes sparse, showcasing the sonic futures of funk. The vocals that creep in are low in the mix and spaced out. The rhythms are there. The vocals are wild. You can get lost in it. It’s electro-funky with a splash of the new wave, a dash of R&amp;B in it.\n\nWe get that R&amp;B, new-wave-y feel echoed elsewhere, too. It’s what The Funk is most often Trojan-horsed in with Dazz. “She’s The One” takes us there. That warble effect—the one big chord in the mix, the soft harmony almost string-like fading in and out with Skip again taking the lead. It’s pop. It’s cool. It spreads the rhythm a little thin for purists, but it brings some Funk. We see a similar move on the b-side with “Dream Girl.” Pop/R&amp;B cheese in the vocals but that bass moves melodic, the synth and guitar help hold the rhythm. The sax (Robert Harris) leans jazz but holds its own as a funk solo. “Main Attraction” goes mostly the same route, but less melodic so more a straight-ahead dance vibe—maybe a pre-cursor to the New Jack stuff down the road. But the guitar brings a little (lowercase) funk that’s against smoothed out, sparse drums and real wide, almost-ambient synths. The heavy synth-bass drop on “Undercover Lover,” the guitar scratch, probably gets us closest to The Funk in Pure Form on *Jukebox*. The silky vocal melody—particularly in the verses, I think it’s cool on the bridge—is the main thing that takes us out. \n\nEighties rock is all over this thing too. Especially in the guitar licks that dip in and out across these tracks. “Keep You Comin’ Back For More” is in fact a straight ahead rock track, just heavy on the hip hop production: almost pure machinery beginning to end. Big drums under the monotone vocal. It’s got hair metal sensibilities down deep. A dope guitar solo from Roland Bautista right at the fade-out. Shades of Princeliness on this. If that’s your bag. \n\nThe slow jam, “Heartbeat,” is a Keith Harrison/Skip Martin duet—heavily toward that R&amp;B sound but a decent, heavy bass line underneath. Some funk elements in the guitar. But it’s more slick than funk. It’s a cool track. The keys are putting in work. But it doesn’t scratch that itch, you know? Same with the deeper-cut slow jams, “I’ve Been Waiting” and “So Much Love.” Unfunky, slow-dance cheese. I love it for what it is, but what it is ain’t Funk. It’s the packaging that gets Funk-lite delivered.\n\nThat’s my beef with Dazz. I like em. I do. And maybe I’m a little burned out on this era—I was spinning Roger’s late-80s stuff the other day. Aurra… but then again, this is everyone’s beef with the era, right? Pop, Rock, R&amp;B, New Wave, Hip Hop, new genres mainstreaming and funk-adjacent-enough that it becomes tempting to bring elements of funk forward but just surrounded by other kinds of sounds. The problem is that all these sounds—with the exception of hip hop maybe—necessarily smooth shit out. We put P-Funk bass lines in R&amp;B tracks, but to compensate we drown them in smooth vocal melodies. We put funk guitar licks in pop tracks, but to keep it pop we take the stutter out of the drums and hit steady bass kicks on a machine. \n\nIt’s not everyone’s bag but, as I say, it’s a piece of the story that deserves to be celebrated. It’s the move from “Funk music” to “that’s funky.” So get funky. Go ahead and dig it. They got so much lovin for ya baby…",

    "title": "Sly and the Family Stone - Greatest Hits (1970)",
    "content": "Man. I had been trying to figure when to come back to Sly, which record, for a minute. Given the recent passing, I don’t know, it feels appropriate to cheat a little, to bend my own rules and not really pick any album. Just focus on Sly, you know? Hopefully these words do him and his brilliance some small degree of justice. This is one of my favorite Sly stories, anyhow. And I think the story’s been told a little wrong. \n\nBy 1970, Sly and his merry band of co-ed, racially integrated misfits had released four albums: *A Whole New Thing* (1967), *Dance To The Music* (1968), *Life* (1968), and *Stand!* (1969). In addition, the Family had dropped big, ear-worm, seeming-to-be-on-every-radio singles like “Thank You,” “Hot Fun In The Summertime,” and “Everybody Is A Star.” And, you know, Sly really was everywhere. Superstardom at levels no one had seen before. *Rolling Stone* magazine. Woodstock. Behind the scenes, though, cracks were showing. That genius—that artistic power, that brilliance—had to be counter-balanced by his own demons, and the pace of releases demanded by the label was not sustainable for Sly or the Family by 1970. Something had to give. \n\nAhead of the 1971 album, *There’s A Riot Going On*, famously, the family began to fracture. See, Sly’s pull was something else. While contemporaries of his seemed to cycle through musicians, The Family remained steady across their first four albums: Sly on organs, guitars, harmonicas, all kinds of stuff; Larry Graham on bass; Rose on keys and vocals; Freddie on guitar; Cynthia Robinson on trumpet and iconic interjections; Jerry Martini on sax; Greg Errico on drums; a group called “Little Sister” provided backing vocals too. In funk terms that’s a goddamn small list of credits for four whole albums and a grip of singles, no? Yeah. But ahead of 1971–circling it now—that small group would shake itself up. Sly moved to LA. Seeing trouble coming with the partying, drugs, missing gigs, Larry left the band. Greg—y’all saw the documentary, my dude was gutted—left too. Things were falling apart and Sly, genius that he was, was putting pieces together brilliantly for the next album—I mean really on some revolutionary shit in the middle of the chaos—but it was a slow road. CBS was restless. There was money to be made if they did the unspeakable: do a greatest hits collection, write the obituary three years in. \n\nSo that’s what they did. The low-hanging fruit. But in doing it they also showed the world exactly who and what Sly was. Because, in cobbling together the most known singles and the least heavy cut off of three of the albums, they created a phenomenon. Quintuple platinum today. Quintuple. Fucking *quintuple*. That’s right. Sly Stone—writer of every one of these damn tracks. You can pick up his scraps while he’s busy, lazily shove ‘em out the door, and live off your cut of a quintuple fucking platinum record. That’s how good Sly Stone was, man. \n\nTo be fair, there are a few things here that make this more than a run-of-the-mill “Greatest Hits.” Though it’s mostly a project that takes original album versions of these iconic tracks, three tracks—“Hot Fun In The Summertime,” “Thank You,” and “Everybody Is A Star”—had only been released as singles previously. Beyond that, though? No live tracks. No unreleased tracks. No big remixes. Nothing flashy. So what is it then that makes something like this go quadruple platinum? I mean… it’s the pure brilliance, the joyful excellence of early-era Sly and the Family Stone. Right?\n\nLet’s get into it. We open with “Higher,” an absolute funk-rock banger. Sly is bringing the entire case for the blues to this one, from the progression itself to the harmonica. From there we’re into “Everybody Is A Star,” the last recording with the classic lineup and a #1 Billboard hit in 1970 *without appearing on an album*. Then we’re into the biggest, game-change-ing-est track: “Stand!” That melody, man. And that change at the end! The outro to “Stand!” might be the funkiest bars in music. Or maybe it’s the break in “You Can Make It If You Try,” a few tracks later. Or maybe it’s a stretch of “Thank You,” all the way at the back-end of the compilation… I don’t know. \n\n“Life” and “Fun” cap off the first side of the compilation and really complement each other well. Both got that subtle 4x4 beat, leaning into the sort of layering of simplicity that Sly does so well, right? None of the parts of early Sly tracks are difficult individually, but it’s how Sly pieces them together that’s the genius. Like in that riff to “Fun.” Straightforward drums. The bass has a bop to it, but there’s no runs or fills. The guitar is a little loose but it’s holding straightforward rhythm. Then the vocals come in in unison. Then the horns cut. Sly’s early songs show us the construction. It’s kinetic shit. There’s no listening to Sly passively. \n\nThat active composing within the song is maybe best captured by the breakthrough single that opens the b-side: “Dance To The Music.” We know that this was a play for sales after a rough debut album (note: no songs from that debut make it to *Greatest Hits*), but don’t miss the pop brilliance on display. We get that same 4x4 drum beat and Cynthia commanding us to get on up and dance and then—the vocals. Just the tambourine. It’s a whole scene in a song. The guitar noodling. Horns in and out. Passing the vocal across three octaves. It’s a party song and scientifically so. “Riiiiiide Sallyyyy riiide now!”\n\n“M’Lady,” “Hot Fun In The Summertime,” and “Everyday People” get on the rock trip again—showing Sly’s rock n roll chops off in a big way. That driving bass in “Everyday People,” the piano taking its space to just breathe, the vocals starting to soar but staying down close enough to keep us in the back-and-forth orbit of the song: short verse, ring into the chorus, the backing, then back. “Hot Fun” puts it all in the vocals: soft and sort of blended in the verses and then the sharp, simple repetition of the chorus we build into. “A country fair in the countryside,” baby—it’s pure Americana if you listen. And so was Sly, if we’d listen. \n\nOn the other side of the early Sly sound is stuff like “Sing a Simple Song,” that melody-driven funk sound that Sly gives us the blueprints too. Funk in that Stevie Wonder lane. The vocals on that are all over the map. We get the family passing the mic again, Cynthia again commanding us from the stage, the melody, the unison. That bass line giving us some color and Sly’s organ stabbing through. That melodic funk—that wild soulful funk of the mid-70s?—that’s born when Cynthia shouts “DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO.”\n\n“Thank You.” Thank you. That’s all that’s left for me to say about Sly here. But I hope y’all can let me give something a little personal. Seems right for the occasion. Here it is: Like a lot of people around here I came to funk a generation late. By the time I sunk into Sly he was long retired. But recently I was going through some mental health shit and I have a toddler at home who loves to dance. And it was her asking for “funky music” and us dancing together to this greatest hits LP… I mean there’s no better medicine than dancing with a toddler to “Thank You Falettinme Be Mice Elf, agaaAin!” \n\nSo, thank you, Sly, for the gifts you brought and the gifts you left us, man. Rest in power.",

    "title": "Zapp - The New Zapp IV U (1985)",
    "content": "In 1977, the Troutman brothers—Roger, Larry, Lester, and Terry “Zapp” Troutman, that is—ditched their band name after self-releasing one album, *Introducing Roger.* The Troutman brothers were at the time performing under the name Roger and the Human Body. I love that name. Adore it. But from that point forward they would perform under the name they’d steal from their own bassist: Zapp. And as Zapp these dudes put in work, playing out and making a name for themselves in a thriving Midwest scene, eventually catching the attention of Bootsy, George Clinton, and Warner Bros., where they would record their debut album, featuring arguably the biggest funk track of all time: “More Bounce To The Ounce.” \n\n*Zapp* and “More Bounce” were a real turning point for funk. It would be the one and only album the crew did with George, with the Troutmans reportedly jumping ship shortly after due to looming financial calamity. The future would come to look different, even as older sounds of funk remained—the 9-minute jam, the break, the One. And Zapp was bringing all kinds of new flavors to funk out the gate. They’d toggle voice-box-infected, synthed-out, computer-programmed insanity sounds into gospel-infused, conga-driven breakdowns like it’s 1972. They’d be “More Bounce” and “Brand New Player.” At least early on, anyhow.\n\nWithout George and back with Warner Bros., Zapp followed up their debut with *Zapp II,* which cemented Roger’s vision of a fully electro, fully digital, fully inside-the-computer future. It’s a vision he would fine tune from there to *Zapp III*, and then he possibly perfected it with this one, 1985’s *The New Zapp IV U.* There’s a confidence to this album. True electro swagger. You hear it from the opening fade in, that robotic vocalization in the void of the first few seconds. It’s announcing itself. “So ah-ah-ah-ah-ah FRESH.”\n\nIf this is Roger’s ultimate vision of electro-funk, it’s got to be marked first and foremost by the out-there, collection-of-sounds approach to each track. We get it all in “It Doesn’t Really Matter.” We get some classic funk sounds there: that guitar combo (Roger and Aaron Blackmon) bringing it classic with the funk chords and a dope solo ripping through, horn stabs punctuating the verses, the looping chorus. We get some classic Zapp too: Roger with the boxes running a a full range of falsettos, the big hand claps, the wide synths. But there’s also a sense that hip hop has turned back on funk and is shaping it—that Roger is making a hip hop track on this with all those effects. You get this sense of where funk has been and where it’s going, and then Roger: “Do you remembeEeEeEer Sly Stone?” We’ve seen it in funk before, Betty Davis sending up the blues greats. Zapp’s not faking the funk. He’s bringing it right to us and then taking us along for the next trip.\n\nWhat he’s bringing is the bigness of a futuristic turn that takes the “out there”—the motherships, the extra-terrestrial, the space of it all—and brings it right up close. We’re digitized, computerized fully. The future is in the machines. We create in the machines. I type these on my phone, man, and you take a track like “I Only Have Eyes For You” and see what Roger was about: in the size of those effects, the massive chime/slide sound, whatever that is?, the plodding kick, the ambience of it, and inside he’s doing straight soul melodies and singing straight soul themes: “millions and millions of people go by, but they all disappear from view, and I only have eyes for you.” Damn. Real human love, programmed.\n\nThat’s a situation we see echoed everywhere, too. Big electronic sounds brought down to soulful earth. It’s completely alien. Entirely human. “Cas-Ta-Spellome” is, in my mind, the funkiest track on the album. The thickness on that bass alone! And the gang vocal—that’s big funk for real. “Ja Ready To Rock” has that digital rumble underneath—that staggering bass—and the handclaps carry through. It’s sparse. Meditative as electro can get. The vocals never seem to fully evolve to where they’re trying to get. It’s just this slow sense of suspense creeping, trying to find out where Roger’s about to drop us, but instead we get that suspense—that build-up—distilled into a strangely personal electro lament: ja ready to rock? Are you ready? Are you? \n\nWe get a sign of the rock supremacy of the 80s across the album, too. It ain’t just cyberfunk. “Make Me Feel Good” is a blues-rock, almost country-rock track with a smooth enough vocal to make it not seem totally out of place, only a little out of place. A little more upbeat, we creep up toward arena rock—especially in the backing vocals, the synth progression, an absolute beast of a drum solo—in “Rock ‘N’ Roll.” Similarly upbeat but more centered on the keys, “Radio People” opens in atmospheric space before turning pure pop-rock, even as it’s filtered through the futuristic falsettos and basses of the voice box. It’s new wave-y. Roger’s pop vocal, toying in a higher register, and the chorus melody gives it away. “Itchin For Your Twitchin” is that dirty, Prince-ly funk rock. The guitar solos on that are pure insanity—big, proggy. The deep, deep bass hits. The monotone vocal is pure Prince: “I want your body. Your love I can’t resist. Delirious.” Dirty shit. Dirty dirty. That’s my jam on this one, personally. That synth insanity screams electro at you but it’s a rock track through and through. \n\nThe big single—the one that needs space here and everywhere—is “Computer Love” though. The scratching in the back, the effects, that tom effect on the drum track, the backing vocal, the vocals somehow airy but fully programmed. The mission is in the title and it is accomplished out of the gate. It’s a slow jam for the cybernetic future accomplished by the dark, please vocal trio on it: Roger, Gap Band’s Charlie Wilson, and gospel/soul newcomer Shirley Murdock. That sort of pleading duet becomes a staple of dope 80s funk. The Rick James one. Mtume’s “Juicy Fruit.” It’s a whole vibe, especially when they—like Mtume before—couple that layered vocal with a real open hip hop beat. A real heavy bass line here too. Shit is wild, man. The digitized scat vocal on the outro—the lead reaching for it with that soulful growl in the vocal. It’s riding both R&amp;B and funk simultaneously. It’s the least electro track here, ironically enough, and I think that’s the choice to make to let the vocals on this thing breathe, man. That digital love hits as good as any kind.\n\nThere’s another time and place to talk about the horrific end of the Zapp story. But that time and place ain’t here or now. It’s not relevant now. Now it’d be pure sensationalism. So instead go dig that syste-systic humanistic sound! Ja ready?",

    "title": "Funkadelic - Cosmic Slop (1973)",
    "content": "(Re-post. This was marked NSFW and dropped from the sub earlier?)\n\nDepending on how you count *Toys*, *Cosmic Slop* is the fifth or sixth Funkadelic album. It gets overlooked a lot, in my opinion, but it deserves a central place among Funkadelic lore for a few reasons. First of all it’s got a crazy small list of contributors—a real steady cast of characters for a Funkadelic album. Starting after this one we get a lot more of a P-Funk collective effort—a different drummer on every track kind of stuff—but this is the last of the contained lineups. The vocals are passed around but every track is Cordell Mosson (bass), Tyrone Lampkin (drums), Garry Shider and Ron Bylowski (guitars) and Bernie Worrell (keys/clavinet). There’s an added instrument now and then but it’s a real straightforward effort. The line between Parliament and Funkadelic is still visible. Audible even. \n\nAnyway, second, and relatedly, this one is notable because it’s the first Funkadelic LP to feature exclusively sub-5:00 songs. 50-yard dashes of funk-rock party top to bottom—mind you I mean that in the best way possible. And third, it’s notable in P-Funk lore because it’s the first album to commission the artwork of Pedro Bell. Pedro would stay on and have these sorts of chaotic, collage-esque, underside-of-the-homeroom-desk pieces featured on Funkadelic and George Clinton solo releases through the mid-80s. I love them. *Computer Games* and *One Nation* are more to my visual taste than *Slop* but here I dig the montrousness of it, the nod to *Maggot Brain* in it. Something ancient about it… Terrifying… Beautiful… \n\nWhatever the motivation—all I’ve gleaned is the label and the band didn’t often agree on art direction—it’s clear that this cover would set the tone for the Funkadelic image moving forward. Musically, it might be we can say the same? Maybe. It’s a bit cleaner of a sound than those early albums. A cleaner rock sound. I don’t want to say a “radio-friendly” sound—that charge might come later for these dudes—but maybe?\n\nA side effect of what I said before—that this album only features sub-5:00 songs—is that we got a version of Funkadelic with a little less room to wander. The bigness of tracks like “Maggot Brain” was, yeah, a lot about the absolute beast of a solo, but also the room for that solo to ebb and flow, curve back in on itself, toy with volume, with tracking. You get lost in it. You lose time in it. We get a parallel feeling on this album in “March To The Witches Castle,” not the *same* feeling. We don’t lose time but we feel it stretch under a more hypnotic guitar lick (Shider and Bylowski trading that), the drum swapping between the snare march and that kick-driven, funk groove. We hear it in the deep, deep George vocal, that narration. \n\nThat ancient psychedelia isn’t the only place we revisit here. The soulful, almost-chant-like vocals in prior places like “If You Don’t Like The Effects” and “Can You Get To That” get small echos in “You Can’t Miss What You Can’t Measure.” The deep, bluesy guitar licks on earlier tracks like “Hit It And Quit It” and “Mommy, What’s A Funkadelic” gets a loud echo in “Trash A Go-Go” (2:27 on that one is all), which goes heavy on the Jimi Hendrix influences, down to that conversational, bluesy vocal delivery—down to the tambourine, even. \n\nBut I don’t want y’all thinking this is a soft effort or that it’s entirely retreading old ground. There’s an underlying auditioning here for different iterations of The Funk. The iconic “Nappy Dugout” opens with us falling into a heavy funk, Bernie Worrell kicking in the clavinet and melodica and evolving us a step beyond where Funkadelic had been. The duck call is doing the same for real. And the closer, “Can’t Stand The Strain” taps into a blues-rock lane, passing the vocal in that animated way only P-Funk can do. Garry’s falsetto down to George’s bass, man. I’ll have to link that one. That’s one of my favorites here. \n\n“No Compute” is on that real bluesy kick too—not the psychedelic blues we have scattered over the early albums but something altogether different. It’s light, more rock n roll in that classic sense. Off the back of that we get into “This Broken Heart,” finally in slow jam territory. Ben Edwards on the vocals. Psychedelic in the guitars but pure prog soul everywhere else. It’s a jam for real, and it’s a place I don’t see Funkadelic often go. Not sure why. Maybe the cost of the string octet they brought in for it. \n\nSome of the better-known songs add to this range too. “You Can’t Miss What You Can’t Measure” nods toward Sly and that Bay Area sound—light, just a tad of gospel infused there—passing the vocal around the stage. “Let’s Make It Last” is heavy—not like Funkadelic is strange to heaviness in their rock tracks—but next to “Witches Castle” you can tell they’re on a bit of a lighter, softer train of thought than those prior albums. Smoothed-out even. It feels more planned. More thematic. Garry Shider’s vocals doing a lot of the lifting on that one for real. \n\nGarry’s vocal showcase though is on the title track. Side B, track 1. “Cosmic Slop.” This is the one for me. The drums (Tyrone Lampkin) from the jump toggle between real modest, straight-ahead time-keeping to far-out riffs and fills. He’s on a real one with this jam—that’s Tyrone on the congas and everything else too. The keys are low on the mix and light, but they flesh it out. The vocals sometimes feel the same. It’s a little bit ghostly in the production. It’s the cosmos, and the dual guitar solos—Garry and Ron Bykowski layering each other—is itself the cosmic slop: heady, beautiful, growing from the rest of the track and then eating the track whole. And riding on all that is Garry’s voice—that R&amp;B soft falsetto killing it: “I can hear my—I can hear my mother calling me…” Cuts you deep and then the devil speaks, “Would you like to dance with me?” Goddamn, man. \n\nSo, come on, man. Vamp! Or at least ad lib! Dig it!",

I thought I’d give it its own post and see if someone can answer what I got nothin on:\n\n  About this album, but considering a topic other than music : I’ve always wondered WHO was (or ‘’were’’) the designer(s) of the clothes they wore on the album cover; ‘cause the stuff they were is very stylish and has that typical 1980s class, whether casual or more dressed up !   I tried to find here and there, but couldn’t find any information about this, even on the inner sleeve that’s usually inside the album (as far as vinyls are concerned) … While on most other albums, you find that kind of information; for instance, on the next one (‘’Knight of the Sound Table’’), it was ‘’Boss’’ (Hugo Boss) and ‘’Armani’’ (Giorgio Armani); on ‘’Word Up !’’ from 1986 (where Larry Blackmon started sporting that DISGUSTING 😝 red ‘’codpiece’’ …), the designer of their new style of clothing was Jean-Paul Gaultier …   Even though this thread obviously focuses on music, I thought that style  - in terms of clothing -  was also part of 1980s funk, almost as much as music was; so : if ever anyone is a connoisseur and has informations about the designer(s) of the stuff that Cameo former members wore on the ‘’Feel Me’’ album, I’ll take it !                                🙏🏻",

    "content": "I first got into funk in the late '80s / early '90s, when there was quite a big renaissance here in the UK – all sorts of so-called \"Acid Jazz\" bands were popping up left, right and centre, and, of course, there was sampling. \n\nAnyway, at the time, there were a few surefire bangers that compelled everyone to point and shout \"Tune!\" at the top of their voices. Off the top of my head, and in no particular order, these were:\n\nBlack Water Gold – African Music Machine\n\nYou Know You Got Soul – Bobby Byrd\n\nGot to Get Your Own – Reuben Wilson\n\nCross the Tracks – Maceo and the Macks\n\nJust Kissed My Baby – The Meters\n\nThink – Lynn Collins\n\nCharles Wright – Express Yourself\n\nFunky President – James Brown\n\nMind Power – James Brown\n\nGatur Bait – The Gaturs\n\nHercules – Aaron Neville\n\nFug – Cymande\n\nMore Peas – The JBs\n\nOne Nation Under A Groove – Funkadelic\n\nAshley's Roachclip – The Soul Searchers\n\nNT (No Title) – Kool &amp; The Gang\n\nO'Donel Levy – Bad, Bad Simba\n\nWhat would you add to this list? I'm sure there are a fair few I've forgotten, but these are the ones that spring immediately to mind. Of course, there may also be ones I’m not aware of, so please suggest away!",

I’ve since tried to find information about the pianist and maybe an isolated solo but all I ever find is info about Eddie Hazel’s (jaw dropping) guitar work.

But the creator does reveal how BW funked that shit up - wah wah pedal on the Clavinet, autowah on the Prophet.\n\nThe video needs about 150% more Worrell - but it's a start.

    "title": "War - War (1971)",
    "content": "There was a band out of Compton in the 1960s that went by the Creators. I’ve seen it stylized “The Compton Creators” and I prefer it that way. They were started in ‘62 by guitarist Howard Scott and drummer Harold Brown but quickly they solidified a lineup that included Thomas “Papa Dee” Allen on percussion, Charles Miller on sax, B.B. Dickerson on bass, Lee Oskar on harmonica, and Lonnie Jordan on keys and vocals. Together these cats created insane rhythmic rock and R&amp;B that echoed (even surpassed) their neighbors to the north, Santana. But it wouldn’t be until they were approached by ex-Animals (“House of the Rising Sun”) singer Eric Burdon and his manager to rebrand as “Eric Burdon and War” that they took off, really.  And I don’t know how I feel about that. Something seems off about the arrangement every time I real about it. The arrangement. \n\nBut they killed, man. “Spill the Wine” is a blues, psych rock banger. They got big in the London scene especially, jamming with Jimi Hendrix 1970 just as Jimi was getting turned onto Funk. They dropped a second album, *Black-Man’s Burdon*, in 1970. And now I don’t know how I feel about that either... But on the tour in support of the album, Burdon had an asthma attack on stage. The band continued gigs without him. Burdon quit the band. They finished the tour, came home, and dropped this, their debut, self-titled album: *War*. \n\nAnd just like that. That matter-of-fact. Let’s go then. What I love about this album is how much it previews where the band’s sound will peak in the middle of the decade but it’s almost surprising where the roots are, you know? \n\nThere’s plenty of jazz on this, for one. The opener, “Sun Oh Son” comes in heavy on the instrumental, real wide on the guitar, the backing vocals, and breathy under a real pretty harmonica riff and then a solo flute (Charles Miller). There’s plenty of blues there too, rock even. The chorus on this track is iconic, maybe despite—maybe because, even—B. B. Dickerson’s lead vocal. Man. That steady, driving snare under it too. That’s where you start to see the Funk, and start maybe to get a hold of what makes War, War. War is not a Funk band here. Here, they’re a blues band. A rock band. And psychedelic R&amp;B band. And in all those modes they bring heavy, Funk-infused rhythms. On “Sun On Sun” it’s that Harold Brown, Papa Dee percussion duo. Driving down in the riff, the huge block hit on “shotgun.” That bass rumbles, man. Heavy. And that big low end becomes a staple. That big low end sets the tone. \n\nIn “Lonely Feeling,” we get a chirpy piano at the top but then quickly again B. B. coming in big and low and driving the blues into the ground with nothing but a tambourine egging him on. And it’s almost nothing but bass, clicks, and Lonnie’s voice for a good chunk of the track. For a split second it’s nothing but those clicks in the break. But there’s a stomp in that piano too, driving, man. At some point you catch that twang in the guitar, real low down blues. Lonnie’s vocals match it perfect. He’s got somethin to say. He’s got to say it now. He’s got that lonely feeling. Make it gospel. Kill the track. \n\nThe a-side closes with a ballad, “Back Home.” Still on the big low-end but now there’s more melody in Miller’s sax, in the keys and the guitar especially, that bring that soulfulness to the table. You’ll hear it echoed in the lead vocal, and that’s Miller too this time. And you hear it especially in Lonnie’s organ and piano. The slide in, that heavenly, wide lane he kicks in in the chorus. That against the sparse chop of the guitar. That riff. What a pretty track, man. Almost too pretty. But Miller gives himself a wide edge to sprinkle some grit on and he does. He can wail. He can breathe for ya. Man can sing for real. And that sax solo, a little modern, a little bluesy, a little smooth and lost in the sauce of that organ. It’s an easy track to get lost it. It feels a little like that’s the point. The airiness in the sax at the close accents it, too. Sink in. \n\nB-side. “War Drums” gives us whiplash, showing us just how wild the War percussionists will take it by mid decade. Papa Dee cooks here. From the jump. We ain’t back home no more. Shaking in. Horn stabs. Then a drum punctuated ev er y syll a ble. You just gotta dig in on it. Tense. Catch the jazz in the sax solo. It’s got a bop. The organ giving it a little room to jump, to stray and come back. And then? One. Two. Three. Break. I love that percussion break. Papa on the congas. Every down beat explodes man. Every one can get a roll. A hit. A drop. Then that big roll out, with the organ. And DROP back in. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. WAR. And the flute. I side eye this track. It’s weird, man. \n\nConversely, “Vibeka” kills me. Straight up. I fall into that groove on the first beat. We’re on a proggier, funkier kick than most of the album here, but it’s still lush in the chord changes. Romantic like. Lonnie and B. B. bring all the funk here. Harold crashes just enough to make it heavy. And the sax, the harp, just blow right through it. Float on. I love that little riff though, it carries the rhythm in a real way, letting the percussion drag just a bit without getting sloppy. It’s a cool move, man, reminds us why they’re the best to do it. But I also love this track for the harmonica solo. We don’t get a ton of it on this album generally, but seeing that piece come in big on this track sort of previews some of the big War tracks to come. “Low Rider,” for one. And the guitar gets the same treatment, being one of the lone places it’s highlighted. Another chill, bluesy moment, but it builds in a way with some splashy drums that gives it one more dimension. The crescendo, the drop into the riff, the horn line back. And from there we build on it, build wide, more big chords, more layers, those wild organ slides, shiiiiiiiiit man you don’t expect this one to go this big now... take a long fade-out. Let the bass carry us out. \n\nAnd finally, “Fidel’s Fantasy.” WAKE UP, FIDEL. This is my shit. I’ve been obsessed with this one for a minute. From the jump, that deep-in-the mix guitar, the mess of cymbals. WAKE UP. A chime. A laugh in echo. It’s as cinematic as anything in their discography. It tells us a story of temptation, regret, liberation, and loss. It’s an uncharacteristically guitar-driven track, but it’s also the lone Latin standout. Remember the nights in the sugarcane, Fidel, huh? Where is Ana now, Fidel? The piano hits, Papa on the hand drums, it’s big, dramatic, but always rhythmic. A full switch up into a bass transition, new piano tones, none of it out of place. There’s an underlying, felt rhythm in this that overrides everything. No two pieces seem to match. But every piece needs all the others anyway. Down to the flute, almost too deep, blowing along with some piano chords. Then the flute is just somewhere else in a new verse. There’s a guiro on it. Not from the thoughts of Mao or the writings of stodgy men like Lenin and Trotsky, but the fables of Aesop, Grimm, and Hans Christian Anderson. Weird shit. Beautiful shit. \n\nThe breaks as a result vibe more than groove. At any point we can have vocals voiced over. Another flute kick. The piano ends up chugging along more than any other piece here. And it’s steady quarters underneath. Papa Dee bringing color. We’re left with damn near twelve minutes of Latin-esque, damn-near-samba, blues-infused, jam-based jazz interspersed with some wild, political, paranormal commentary. Do you know what’s waiting for you in the world of reality? \n\nSo go on. Your fantasy’s ending. Dig it. I must go, Fidel. Good bye for now. Good bye, Fidel. Good bye.",

    "title": "Parliament - Motor Booty Affair (1978)",
    "content": "Have you seen the music video for George Clinton’s “Atomic Dog”? It’s a scatalogical fever dream. I think there’s a basic man-pursues-woman plot to it but it’s mostly impressionistic character vamps in an industrial.... dog-pound-themed club-slash-arcade? Uncle Jam has a science lab in it, whatever the building’s primary use is. And as the camera sort of just lets this scene unfold, cartoon dogs, stylized usually as video game graphics, are sort of randomly imposed on the screen. It sounds bizarre right? I’ll link it. \n\nI bring this up because Overton Lloyd won some recognition for those graphics, and they became another trend set by Lloyd throughout 80s visual design. And indeed Overton Lloyd has put out tons of iconic designs for the P-Funk collective. His comic came in the early issues of *Funkentelechy*, making his Sir Nose the canon image. He did *Gloryhallastoopid*, the Funky. He did some of the first cartoon images of Bootsy on the Rubber Band albums. And most iconically he did this one, *Motor Booty Affair*. And it is iconic, man. The Sir Nose scene on the cover in that quick-scribble style. The profusion of mermaid booty. And the characters! The pop-outs! Queen Freakaleen. P-Nut Booty Jellyfish. Octave Pussy. And our man on roller skates and a yo-yo, back on the scene! How ya’ll doin’? Mr. Wiggles the Worm. \n\nLet’s go then.  From the ocean comes a notion that the real eyes lies in rhythm and the rhythm of vision is a dancer.  We start there. We start with the warning that this is not your average 50-yard dash of funk. We start with “Mr. Wiggles,” maybe the swingin’-est track in the P-Funk discography. It’s all on that clicky hi-hat, walking steady. The guitar (Michael Hampton) and Bernie’s synths  are it feel expansive and out-there but it’s kept tight under George’s character-building rap. It’s a big welcome to Bimini Road, Downtown Atlantis, all paced, really, by the bouncy, walking bass of Cordell Mosson. Steady. Tip-toeing in it. Giving the synth and the backing vocals something to wiggle on. Cordell holds it down here and, really, the bass holds it down in every track. Brings something fresh in each cut. And no wonder, such a bass heavy album is gonna feature six different bassists across 8 tracks. \n\nAfter Cordell we get a Bootsy cut. “Rumpofsteelskin.” You know him. He’s got dynamite sticks by the megaton in his butt. And Bootsy’s got something to say on this one. He comes in with that big, fuzzy deep end, commanding the track. He’s got the bass and the drums heavy on the one but he’s almost cutting up the melody with the bass line. On occasion he tosses a little slide in, like a reset to remind us that this is that rock-tinged, big Fonk Bootsy is known to bring. The bridge in there shows us a soul counterpart that just makes the big one-hits all the more satisfying on the way out. The wide synths across the track, the big effects, the vocals, the rap, the horns sort of sliding through each other, weaving together. That bigger break toward the close lays it all bare: a big, steady Bootsy groove with a mess of slippery keys, guitars, horns, synths giving a big, deep landscape for us to vibe on. \n\nRange off the jump, right? But this next one, the Junie track, takes it about as wide as you can go. Dig into this one. “(You’re a Fish and I’m a) Water Sign.” Oh shit now. The whole track is Junie and the Horny Horns, except for George and thirty other funkateers give the biggest choral back-up imaginable. That staggering, nervous guitar lick at the open. The swagger on the keys. That deep, deep baritone down in the backing chorus. And Junie gives it to us channeling his Ohio Player days. That yarl. He can’t stand it no more. Junie’s drums swing in and land heavy. Over and over. He’s feeling a little bit better than fine, girl. It’s a wide, soulful, too-heavy groove. So heavy on the low end. And Junie is here dropping it on us. Damn, man. \n\nJunie and Bootsy double up on bass duty with the closer, too. “Deep.” It’s a danceable track for real, giving a little preview of the kind of wiggly bounce the P is gonna bring to the late work. And Bootsy brings that wiggle for real, coupled with Junie’s synth, the heavy foot on the bass drum, it’s got a wide low end that goes wet, fully submerged in the bridge. It’s a cool vibe, the Sir Nose voice shouting “Deep!” against such a wide bass is cartoonish. The female backing vocals over the groove are luxurious. It’s a whole party and Junie’s conducting it from the clavinet, ya’ll. Wild conversation unfolds. It’s like you’re disoriented, floating through the party, and somewhere deep background with the horns, there’s a track there to latch on to. It’s just big you can’t see it, man. Fully in the groove. In the late breaks you’re fully with Bootsy on that lick too. The man is steady on the groove. This might be my favorite Parliament closer, man. \n\nBut the big single here, no doubt, is “Aqua Boogie.” Or, and I’ll only type this once, “Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadoloop.” It’s their last mega hit and one of my favorites. The rhythm section here is the best of what P-Funk is offering into the 80s. The hand claps, the heavy foot on the kick, the digital low-end walking up to the One. That real tinny, real sparse guitar. It’s a groove man and that’s Bernie on the synths, including the bass line. And Bernie carries it with that low end. Into the chorus it’s all him. Through the breaks he’s holding it steady. In the other hand it’s all synth wiggle, big effects, bubbling up alongside Catfish snapping that guitar lick, Bernie is recording damn near ten different synths and keyboards on this. Going off. And the... pterodactyl? Wild shit. Wild, wild shit. Props to Catfish for giving the counterbalance on it. Love the way that dude builds out the pocket. \n\nThe open to the b-side, “One of Those Funky Thangs,” puts Tony Green on the bass. Only time I’ve ever seen this name. Dude can hit a pocket deep in the mix though. It’s classic funk. The closest to the 50-yard dash we were told we don’t want (but dig here nonetheless for real). Bernie’s synth builds out the low end again pretty big. The horny horns get some room to shine with it, and the range of wild effects—slide whistles, someone doing virtuosic shit on a triangle, cartoonish shit in the backing vocals we all love—elevates it here when it could work against it. The wide synth chords, the chimes, the triangle, the whistle, it’s all part of the party the Horny Horns are at the center of. And they own the breaks to prove it. \n\nBut damn this here is my jam: “Liquid Sunshine.” Gary Shider, crazy underrated as a front man. Bernie once again holding down bass duty on the synths. Bringing more wiggle than your average worm, but hitting it precise too. That precision is dope, complemented by Mudbone’s drum, that driving snare, and the cut through of the backing vocal: “Shine! Sun shine...” There’s a digital, wiggle effect in the back that kills me every time, just seems so counter to the chorus vocal. It’s weird dude. Real weird and real cool. A bit of a spacey dimension around a punchy bass line. And late in the track, that near-outro, that little bridge, the “no more teachers,” Bernie’s bass hand goes into overdrive. Something in the tone softens it all just a pinch, but it’s urgent too. Something uncanny in the track man, maybe dark even. I can’t put my finger on it. A laziness, a summer weekend laziness, but the backdrop to it is manic. I love the vibe. And Garry’s rising guitar late in the track reminds you just how wide and how deep the vibe is. I dig it heavy and I hope y’all do too. \n\nThat leaves the title track. Yet another Junie feature right before the closing Junie feature. We got Junie on the lead vocal, George close behind though, weaving these vocals together in this hypnotic drone. Skeet Curtis hitting a bubbly bass now—most bubbly line here I think—that’s the piece that keeps it from getting real sludgey with the vocal effect. Those high pops almost skip, man. He’s got a little boogie in it too. A good danceable edge it in, Tyrone Lampkin helping hold that down with a steady play between the kick and the hi hat. And all that gets cut right down with that Garry Shider riff. A simple little progression but just enough again to break out of the deep, man. And that’s what it is here and across this whole album, you come to realize. This is the down to earth P, the aquatic, primordial P, not far out or super spiritualized. It’s wet funk, deep funk, real deep, real low grooves from top to bottom. That walking swing jazz goes deep. The Bootsy/Junie grooves go deep and wide. And even as this title track comes to a close it’s the steadiness in the bass, not walking but just about strutting, that gives it meat. \n\nSo go on and let’s raise Atlantis to the top with the bump and the bop! May I have this swim?",

It’s not a “kinda similar” thing — it’s the exact riff, transplanted as a nod to the Godfather.\n\n2️⃣ P-Funk Lyric Shout-Out – At 6:42, Prince sings “Like George said, let’s get satisfied, let’s get satisfied.” That’s straight from George Clinton’s Get Satisfied off the 1993 album Hey Man… Smell My Finger. Direct homage to George himself.\n\nPrince literally stitches James → George → Prince into one 10-minute funk odyssey.

There were a few reasons for that: I had overplayed Stand in my younger days so it didn’t hold the same magic for me as it did when I was a kid; There’s A Riot Goin’ On had never grabbed me the way Stand did; and Fresh was a new found love, and as such I was listening to it all the time.\n\nWell…. it finally happened. You know that moment when an album switches from huh to whah? It’s been a week now and I’ve been listening to Riot non-stop. Holy shit!!! It is so bloody messy in an amazing way. I now “get it”. I mean, I always recognize that it was a milestone in the trajectory of funk - there was no denying that - but for some reason it just didn’t click with me. Now I am a die hard fan! \n\nI guess now I don’t have to single out any one album… They are all three his masterpiece. \n\nSLY… THANK YOU FALETTINYOSELF BE YOUSELF, AMEN!",

    "title": "Billy Cobham - A Funky Thide Of Sings (1975)",
    "content": "Panamanian-born, Brooklyn-raised, jazz-funk drum icon Billy Cobham. That’s who we’re about today. I wrote about him before in the Grover Washington post because Billy introduced the jazz scene to Grover through his CTI/Kudu connects specifically. But Billy was carving out his own space, obviously. See, after his stint in the Army (he was drafted in ‘65 and played in the Army band for a minute), Billy went and sat in on some iconic situations. He played with Horace Silver, did time as a house drummer for Atlantic and a session player for CTI/Kudu. He played on *Soul Box* with Grover, *White Rabbit* by George Benson—I love that album. And then eventually he’s part of Miles Davis’s funk turn. He’s on the *Jack Johnson* album, for one. Then, John McLaughlin picks Billy up and they do iconic jazz-rock-funk fusion work with the Mahavishnu Orchestra. The jazz pedigree is fully built, man. And it’s a musical lineage I adore. Herbie intersects here. Bob James. Two steps from Jaco and Chick Corea. Stan Clarke. \n\nBut there’s something else at play that’s less about jazz pedigree and more about being big, flashy. Damn right Funky. And like other Funk greats, Billy is building monstrous equipment to get monstrous sound from. Throughout his career, he’s innovating the kit itself, playing the first electric kits in the early 80s, rocking custom, dual bass drums, then a triple bass drum with three linked pedals. He’s getting custom drums built out of different kinds of fiberglass. He’s playing a kit with three different snares. Three-foot fuckin’ gongs. Far out.\n\nThose far-out tendencies, the tendencies that shape the jazz-funk legend of Billy Cobham, were obvious probably from the jump but most definitely by the release of his debut, solo album: 1973’s *Spectrum*. Immediately hit #1 on the jazz chart. A bomb hit the jazz world and Billy kept experimenting, kept growing his kit and his reach through the 70s, perhaps hitting his most lasting, most famous, move beloved note in 1975’s *A Funky Thide of Sings*. \n\nThe album opens with a second of deep, percussive low notes. A single hi hat splash and then—boom. Massive, cinematic brass. That’s Michael Brecker on saxes, Randy Brecker on trumpet, and Glenn Farris on trombone. And the brass is cool, putting in work and all, but it’s what underneath that grabs you. Billy’s almost riding the upstroke most of the song, and the bass line (Alex Blake) has a little bubble. A little stagger to it. Coupled with the synth and really complemented by the lazy guitar. The while rhythm is splashy more than syncopated. You get a sense of chaos but also a wide base for big synth waves and a real plucky guitar solo. It’s got an edge to it. It bends toward psychedelia just a bit.\n\nThat piano riff at the top of “Sorcery,” the gong hitting it in, keeps the cinematic vibe going. But we’re working at a clip now. The whole a-side is shorter tracks, five of them. The synths—that organ tone—and the chorus of horns carries us through here. We get a synth solo first. Billy working it in that tight, funky tradition for the most part. Just a couple of slides into big, high-end chords, but mostly he’s working close to the middle up until the big finish. It’s a tight track that bleeds into a drum solo—super deep, super spacey, not so much sparse as like void, you know?—that then drops us into the title track: “A Funky Thide of Sings.” Real brassy here again but with slightly less of a rock edge compared to the opener. The guitar is thick, fully on the rhythm. The saxes are put to their paces too as it picks up. We get a bigger horn section on this one, Larry Schneider doing the sax work now. The horns are talking to each other as Billy’s drums get splashier as we go bigger and the guitar chimes in right before the horn lick comes back for the close. That last note, hit it with the big synth key. The drum rolls out. So much of this album needs opening credits rolling over it, man. How has this not been sampled more?\n\nBilly is showing some range on this side and “Thinking Of You” leans smooth. The brass is drowned inside a synth tone and flattened. The guitar is felt and then its solo is subdued too. Just little partial chords. And the energy is dialed down (other than the hoppy bass line) until the full-voiced sax solo. Back to the Breckers and Glenn Ferris for the horns. And the layering they do gets echoed later with another dope guitar solo out of John Scofield and a real slinky bass line under it. And that slinkiness, that fullness, that melodic-ness, is echoed in the closer to the a-side: “Some Skunk Funk.” We’re back toward bop, away from the smooth, but the bass line is bringing melody fully now. Almost leading the chord changes, and the horns are messy, jazzy, full of crescendoes and riffs, bouncing off the bass, ripping the whole way. Billy’s bringing it with a whole mess of percussion. By the time we stumble out over the drums we’re damn near breathless. \n\nSo it’s range then. Range is the name of the game. Smooth or edge. Cinematic soul or straight jazz. Billy moves his crew through them, showing range as a band leader, a writer, a composer. And then in the back half, those last three tracks, he’s gonna give you his range as a player. It starts with “Light At The End Of The Tunnel.” We’re in that cinematic lane here but you feel Billy getting heavier with his foot, carving out his fills when he wants, splashing around. The percussion is thick, man, and wide too. The bass and guitar have a lot to launch from because Billy is messing around with shakers, clicks, stomps, and a whole kit giving a thick, thick rhythm. And yeah, then he kicks in a tight solo around the outro. Sticking close to the rhythm.  More march than jazz, but that’s just warm-up, you’ll come to realize, after the last two tracks: “A Funky Kind Of Thing” and “Moody Modes.” Yeah. Jazz virtuoso shit comes fast. \n\n“A Funky Kind Of Thing” opens with some maintenance on the rhythm we just left. It keeps a beat and slowly fizzles out into this wild, free, sparse, solo. The central beat comes and goes on the kick drums. And when it goes we channel bop, you know? Sort of swing between bop and funk, the free form and the One, and blur those lines over time. And those military-sharp rolls in between give it a character, too. You can feel him thinking in all those directions. The transitions sometimes come sudden. Sometimes they’re gradual. They’re always cool as hell. In the back third of the track (9:24 total) we shift toward a Latin rhythm and bring in more to the percussion. Cowbells. Hand drums. And then it’s a psychedelic echo out. I think it’s someone at the board torturing a single cowbell hit. They bring it way loud. Mechanical. Then drop. It won’t be everyone’s cup of tea but if you dig something like a “Maggot Brain” solo, try digging this track that way. \n\nOr, if 9+ minutes of psychedelic jazz-funk drumming isn’t your speed, maybe 12+ of brooding, soulful, experimental smoothness in “Moody Modes” is. This is the jazziest of the tracks but between “Funky Kind” and this you can feel Billy bringing his Miles days with him. He opens on the keys, that soft piano riff, wide synth notes come in underneath. Guitar and bass noodle just at the edge of the melody and then horn hits. The drums filling out underneath soaring brass chords. Then it retreats back into that piano riff, now deep in the mix. End scene, you know? Then piano back in. Light with it. Pretty even. Catch a triangle keeping time deep in there. Billy’s always in a groove. Even here. The piano ringing out lush, going deep, going heavy. Then a sharp turn of a horn strike, and that trumpet brings you into the next scene. The keys underneath go cross-eyed and Billy’s swinging on the kit now. Deep on that double bass now, going kinda wild on the rhythm of it all, right on the edge of the free jazz freak out, but whenever it’s about to stray, it’s like Billy hits a crash and pulls it all back in. It’s a jam, man. Randy Brecker killing the whole track on trumpet. Someone’s blowing deep on a reed in there too. Then the bass solo from Blake. Some assorted, sparse percussion under it. It’s a new scene all the sudden. The double bass screams jazz but it’s not even just that. It’s far out. It goes bluegrass for a split second. Then the snare clock reins us back in. Goddamn we’re covering ground. And it’s back to those opening brass strikes. Back to the big flute. Back to the crashes. Back to the sparse bass and the clicks. One last slide. Out. \n\nGoddamn. \n\nDig it.",

    "title": "Ohio Players - Honey (1975)",
    "content": "In October of 1974, Ester Cordet (real name Ester Sgobba) was featured as Playboy’s Playmate of the Month. She was among a string of notable features, situated between a September issue that featured now-Emmy-award-winning news persona personality Kristine Hanson and December’s issue with Bebe Buell. At the time of her appearance, Ester was a flight attendant. She was accompanied to the shoot by her husband, who ended up in the background of a shot and labeled a “friend” in print. Ouch. But what’s important for us about Ester Cordet’s appearance is that it caught the attention of the Ohio Players, a funk band out of Dayton, Ohio, who just dropped back-to-back platinum albums Skin Tight and Fire, and were accustomed to going to Playboy for the subjects of their next cover art. They decided to bring Ester in for the cover of their next album, the one that would become their most critically-acclaimed, the one that would arguably be the crown jewel of their mid-70s dominance, this one right here: *Honey*. \n\nAnd I’ll complain about NSFW tags here but they earned it on this one. Naked. I mean. Why even bother with the air brush? Anyway. It caught some eyes. And the eyes it caught were shocked enough to believe anything. Like, for instance, there’s a rumor that the honey they coated Ester with burned her skin and left permanent scarring, ending her ascendant career. That’s not true. She kept working, unharmed. Another, more colorful one, is that the Players killed this woman during the shoot and recorded it. In fact, some say, the high-pitched scream deep in the mix toward the end of the breakdown in the smash hit “Love Rollercoaster” (around 2:20 or so) is Ester’s last scream. \n\nThat shit ain’t true either. Ester’s very much alive, pushing 80, looking amazing. But after a DJ made it up and the legend took off, the Players brilliantly decided to take a vow of silence. Don’t confirm or deny. Let people talk crazy. That’s free marketing. And it worked. Platinum status for a third time. Goddamn. Not that I think they would’ve needed the story to get there. Nah. *Honey* is a jam, maybe especially outside of “Love Rollercoaster.” Let’s go track-by-track then.\n\n*Honey* is the third album with guitarist Leroy “Sugarfoot” Bonner as lead singer. My man brings a snarl to the mic that few other Funk acts can touch. It’s bluesy and pushes the Players toward the rock end of the spectrum, and it carries cool pretty much everywhere. The lead track here, title track, “Honey” capitalizes on this. It’s a slow jam, lush even with the strings and all, soft, soulful backing vocals at the jump, but that soft base gives Sugar all kinds of room to snarl and yarl and rap and whisper over it. It’s sensual with that tasteful, soulful edge of the strings, the airy horns, the high-end of the backing vocals. The Players always, always bring romance to it, even the dirtiest shit they put out comes by candlelight. I mean the drums here (Diamond Williams) come dramatic, the piano (Billy Beck) coupled with it being as percussive as a piano can get in that chorus and it’s all crescendo. Almost flashy. Cinematic. \n\nAnd that sorta cinematic vibe carries into the follow up track, “Fopp.” And here we get the dual vocal from Billy Beck. Dude can hit a high note. But as much as “Honey” shows a romantic side, this is all edge. Forward about it. Fopp is a verb. You feel it in that flutter in the kick drum, that guitar tone is heavy, metal, only outdone by Sugar’s vocal delivery, bringing blues with it.  “Fopped last night and the night before.” Self-aggrandizing. And that’s Billy on the falsetto, killing it: “Everybody was... FOPPINNNNNNN’!” The horns that rise up to meet it, man, you aren’t sure if they’re gonna make it and then they fall out. A beat. And then the horns cut it up—hard brass—with those snare shots under it. It’s physical.\n\nWe get a longer lead-in to the next one: “Let’s Love.” Love this slow jam.  “Let’s Love” echoes some of the spaciness from “Honey” but it’s deeper, the horns (that’s Merv Pierce and Pee Wee Brooks on trumpets and Satch on the saxophones), are a little bigger, and the piano (Billy Beck) is a bit more on top of the melody. It’s a cool instrumental, and I love that soft, rising vocal through the verse, there’s depth on it. By the time you hit that high-pitched bridge you’re hooked, and then at the perfect moment it drops you into the instrumental bridge, the piano vamping on it on the way out. They leave a lot of space in the back half and it’s all the better to sink down into the groove and really feel the highs in the backing vocal. Love this tune, man.\n\nThen we close out the A-side with the hyper groove that is “Ain’t Givin’ Up No Ground.” Man this one stumbles in and immediately goes off, and it’s all Billy. He runs the riff off the keys and solos on everything he finds lying around the studio. The Hammond, the Rhodes, the piano, it’s all up in here, not so much woven together or talking to one another as attacking the track from all angles. I mean don’t get me wrong either, Rock Jones with the bass is putting in work, even through the wobbly break underneath the key solo. Diamond obviously is setting the pace, but it’s really the biggest break away from the mic and into the instrumental that the Players give us here. And it’s a work out man. \n\nSide b opens with “Sweet Sticky Thing,” which leans melodic at the jump—that riff from Sugar, the high-end vocals out of Billy, the brass deep underneath, but the sax is always on edge, ready to bring a split second of hard jazz before dropped into a funk-rock chorus. This one is really the jam here. It’s big, spacious, turns in on itself and wanders. It’s got some of my favorite breaks of all time, that rolling guitar coupled on the bass, the sax noodling around on, and those vocals, man, sharp, unison. Always cool. Satch goes off on this one. That’s the headline. Chaotic. Urgent. And at the end that backing vocal, another break. A guitar solo, just ripping it. We’re all over the place man. What a thick, *thick* groove. And that freakout at the close man, wide keys on it. Out there, definitionally. \n\nThen it’s “Love Rollercoaster.” Iconic, dancey track. A little basic in the wake of “Sweet Sticky Thing,” sure, but the brass is real cool on it. I like that lick. The rhythm guitar is highlighted here more than elsewhere too, and the result is iconic. Choppy. The synth does ambience duty deep background but that clicky guitar tone is front and center. It’s just a whole different approach to their instruments, almost a 180 from “Sticky Thing,” and I think that’s partially why this one gets a bad rap. It can feel out of place in the album. The bridge and the breaks are cool though and deserve a shout. The late, sparse break with Ester’s infamous death scream (it’s a rough Billy take though in reality) is a cool moment, the chaos toward the close too. It might be the best highlight of auxiliary percussion you’ll get on *Honey*, honestly. And if there’s one thing I want more from these dudes it’s that percussion.\n\nThe closer, “Alone,” feels so ahead of its time. So much R&amp;B from the last 20 years hits like this. That real visceral guitar tone and strum, the chimes and the keys underneath. The vocal tone. Delivering lines like “this is just a silly game.” The cadence. It’s gorgeous. Heavy. Then you get those keys talking back and force on the crescendo, the split second break and that yarl: “This was just a silly gyayayaaaame.” There’s a tiny bit of psychedelia on it—especially in that guitar. And it’s proggy as hell in its structure, but it’s all blues at the same time. I adore this track, truly. At the end you feel the whole thing fall apart dramatically instead of fade out or close out. Goddamn. It hits hard as a closer. A final statement from Sugar with those blues. A final showcase for the keys. Leaves you exhausted but wanting more. Maybe it’s a good spot to close. Or as good as any. They showed you a whole lot already. \n\nReally, *Honey* closes in a way that makes you see just how ahead of the game these dudes were, arguably more than most from that era. Between the pleading, reserved, sparse R&amp;B in “Alone,” that hyper-groove, synth showcase in “Ain’t Givin Up,” and those back-to-back but completely opposite singles in “Sticky Thing” and. “Rollercoaster,” I mean come on now. You can’t deny how incredible this one is. Don’t doubt it. Go dig it.",

    "title": "Shotgun - Good, Bad &amp; Funky (1978)",
    "content": "Somewhere in the late 70s you can feel all the sudden a poppy-er, more palatable version of funk that isn’t quite disco but converging with that sensibility. Commercial bands arrive, you know? Not carving out territory really but reliably pushing out a fun, dance-able funk, often pretty brassy and usually verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus in their composition. I like a lot of these kinds of bands. I put Brass Construction in that lane. Some Rufus fits the bill. Commodores. It’s a profusion of acts that are sort of constructed for the moment. Some of it is ass. Some of it rips. Shotgun—the Detroit-born, Motown-bred band I’m here to talk about today—rips. \n\nShotgun was an ABC band that formed out of the dissolution of another band, 24-Carat Black. It’s a dope name for a dope group mentored by Dale Warren, the strings master over at Motown. Warren wrote and produced their only album, a heady concept piece, in 1973. It’s called *Ghetto: Misfortune’s Wealth*. Stax put it out. It is the proggiest of prog soul. It’s very cool. Dre, Nas, and Kendrick have sampled it. Kendrick a lot, actually. It’s widely available on streaming platforms and worth a listen. They would record another album and leave it unfinished when they broke up in 1974. They were all still teenagers.\n\nThen, within a year, 24-Carat members Billy Talbert (lead guitar and keys), Tyrone Steels (drums and vocals), Ernest Lattimore (guitar and vocals), and Greg Ingram (sax), teamed up with Larry Austin (bass), DJ Resch (drums), and William Gentry (trumpet) to form Shotgun. There hasn’t been a single crew I’ve written about (and it’s been weirdly a lot of them) that I’ve found less on. They aren’t in any books I own. Their online presence in minimum. They ain’t even on Spotify. I’m in the internet archive trying to find anything on these dudes and all I got is confusion on who the original trumpet player was. And that’s weird, man. Because they charted. Their self-titled debut peaked at a respectable #42. They landed singles, too. The radio single in the face of hyper-experimental, far-out, borderline institutionalizable Funk—and the funk-rock single, in particular—now that’s what Shotgun was shooting for, at least early. And they landed a couple big ones in 1978, off this album, this funk-rock party-on-wax that is *Good, Bad &amp; Funky.* \n\nThe first single off *Good, Bad &amp; Funky* was the lead, title track. And “Good, Bad &amp; Funky” is one hell of a lead single, man. It comes in all percussion with a chant behind it. But it’s not that Afro-centric, spiritual chant, you know? It’s a party chant: get on up and get off! And then it’s the guitar riff, low, distorted, a little ominous. It’ll couple with the piano, hit the downstroke a little harder, and it’s pure funk-rock. The vocals are of that straightahead, disco-has-hit-oh-shit soulfulness. It begs you to sing along, never going too high on the lead vocal. And that’s all praise. I want to say it’s almost close to Tower of Power. Commercial, you know? Digestible. And it’s the rock instrumentation and those vocals that make the so. And even deeper, it’s the percussion and the chant. Solid rock, man. We get it most in the vocal. Ernest and Tyrone can growl. They can take it high. They belt. And the backing sort of lean toward the funky unison—makes for a nice balance with the breaks. Love the bass line there too. \n\nSo the rock edge is set, you know? Almost an Isley vibe to me sometimes. And that’s where most of this album sits. “Danger of the Stranger” drives home the rock sensibility underneath the record. The horns hit here in a way they don’t in the singles. The solos rip, but otherwise it’s mostly color for me. The horn line here though is dope. It’s thin (it’s a thinner section generally) but it’s built into the groove in a cool way. The vocals here are also a little more rock n roll than elsewhere. Throaty. A little bit of a bluesy growl on it and it’s echoed in the guitar distortion. It’s loud. The big high note seals it. This is a rock band. And a bluesy one at that. “Sister Love” brings foot-stompin’ blues. Lyrics about queens in New Orleans with record machines. Lazy snare hits. That clavinet, the guitar noodling around it, the horns off doing their thing (here more than most places anyhow), and a straight stomp on the bass. The lyrics come in almost staggered. The track as a whole wants to make you think Meters but it’s more “Mississippi Queen” at its core, really. But then it’s got this voice box, like an effect almost, plays like a synth voice, and the way this extra bit comes in late and plays out with the drums at the close feels so out of left field but perfectly at home. Roger used to call his stuff the new blues and this feels like why, you know?\n\nIt ain’t all wild though. “Fire It Up” is more straight rock. Almost cheese. *Almost*. Not quite though. It’s got movement in the bass, and a cool open, it could be a massive track if it took off from there but it stays restrained. Cool riff. Horn accents give it some room, but it stays tight. Sticks to the formula. “Dance and dance and dance and dance.” The bass keeps the groove but no one does much with it. Even Ernest’s guitar solo gets turned down in the mix, close to home. It’s purposeful in that formulaic-feeling construction. It feels like an intermission, all most. Stretch the legs then come in back for the closer. And I’ll get to the closer eventually. \n\nBut first, now, that rock lane—wide though it is on this album, hitting blues, pop, dance in it—ain’t the only thing going. “Love Attack” was the second single off this thing, after all. And in my opinion it’s the better of the two. Very cool, big-when-they-need-to-be vocals. And goddamn that chorus slaps, even just the way they stwp into it—and then, yeah, even on a ballad kick it’s still all percussiveness again. DJ Resch on the kit with a bit of a flair on it, especially the hi hat. He snaps a couple times on this. Larry Austin’s bass in on the action, snapping off beat, rubbery, and driving the one-beat home. Those two lock in under Greg Ingram’s sax solo and just kill me. The groove is deep. And this is a bedroom track at heart. It’s the brand of Funk I will always go off about here when I get a chance. Bass heavy slow jams with a deep, sparse groove. And the vocals that agitate til they almost go full out of body, full gospel. Shit these dudes can sing. And in the second verse, the way they weave into the vocals? It hits for real. This one needs a link, dammit. \n\nAnd “I Wish I Could See You Again” is gonna drive home the tender, soulful ballad side of the album. It’s all Lattimore for the writing, Clare Fisher arranging the strings, the rest of the crew in the background, widening it out, letting that lead vocal float. It’s functionally acapella, but you can’t ignore that smooth rhythm section and goddam that guitar again? Even in the ballads these dudes can’t help but bring straight rock. Just a taste when they can. \n\nBut there’s another gear too, in tracks like “I’m All Strung Out,” that preview a disco turn on the horizon that Shotgun will partake in just a little. It’s got the soulful, pleading vocals, but they’re bigger and they got a little grit. The guitar is way clean, poppy, and the melodic notes in the bass and restrained drums make this all dance. All day. Horns come in to wiggle now and then and about halfway through the track, yeah, chimes. And then those strings. They got their own riff on it and it’s very cool. That whole extended breakdown is a victory lap for that brand of funk. Lush, pretty, poppy, dancey.\n\nBefore we go, we also need to sit for a second with the one-two punch at the close: “Space-N” and “All Spaced Out (All Funked Up).” “Space-N” is 87 seconds of ambient, digitized noise. Far out. Spacey. Foreboding. And the track that’s tied to it is “All-Spaced Out,” the closest thing to a horn showcase we get. It’s the closest to a synth-voice playground we get. There’s real horn lines in the JB vein, almost. There are laser noises out the synth. Radar noises. Space invader noises. It comes in on a solid, pop-funk riff, coupled the piano, and then the horns kick in cool before the vocal leads: a “woke up this morning” line. Those horns are circle back at the top of the chorus, playing on the vocals. But those vocals grow here--more voices than any other track. Less pressure on the performance, more room for horns. On a different vibe here. Bringing jam funk. A continuation of the Sly sound, just a little. Experimental, but the core is a rock jam. Enough throwing the composition out of the expected. Breaks turn to solos. Solos get passed rapid fire. The pieces play dramatically together. Horns cut into synths. Guitars cut into horns. The synth and guitar talk now, getting closer. Ernest kills one last guitar solo somewhere in the middle. It’s real cool. Everyone’s riffing now. Everyone. \n\nYou too, even. So go ahead. Rock on.",

    "content": "I really like the band, Cameo was funky, futuristic, and fly. They evolved with the times and their later albums, but never lost their groove. Their ability to pivot while still owning their sound is legendary. And if you listened to popular albums like \"single life\"and \"word up\" you've already experienced one of the greatest 80s funk albums ever tbh\n\n By the early 1980s, Cameo had not only redefined their lineup but also their entire  architecture. What set them apart—particularly from their contemporaries—was their forward-thinking embrace of synthesizers and drum machines, not as accessories, but as foundational instruments(of which was exceptional). Larry Blackmon was one of the first funk bandleaders to fully lean into the LinnDrum and Roland synths, crafting tight, punchy grooves that left behind the extended jams of '70s funk. You hear it clearly on “Single Life” and “She’s Strange”those tracks are built on minimalist, synth-heavy frameworks, allowing the rhythm section to breathe while keeping the groove relentless and danceable.\n\nTheir use of space was just as important as the notes they played. In “Word Up!”, for example, the synth bassline is stark, aggressive, and deliberate. The call-and-response structure, paired with Blackmon’s clipped, almost barked vocals, creates a track that feels both futuristic and rooted in African American rhythmic tradition. “Candy” is another key example—layered synth textures (also has a funky horn section) give it that sweet, melodic atmosphere, but it’s still anchored by a head-nodding, electronic funk rhythm that remains timeless.\n\nI know cameo is very popular amongst funk fans but their virtuosity has to be admired they created timeless pieces of music and their influence is undeniable,their longevity is insane too",

    "title": "Parlet - Play Me Or Trade Me (1980)",
    "content": "I love the P-Funk ladies. I wrote about the Brides here before and *Funk or Walk*. George had a way of producing the ladies so they’d be multi-dimensional and big without going cartoonish. It’s powerful, it’s far out, it’s Funky. And even more than the Brides—even before the Brides, technically—I think that formula was tweaked and perfected with the other big name, P-Funk, girl group: Parlet. \n\nParlet wasn’t around long. A lot of these spin-offs weren’t. But they formed in 1978 essentially simultaneously with the Brides. It was part of a larger effort to get the ladies singing background—names like Mallia Franklin, Jeannette Washington, Dawn Silva, Lynn Mabry, Jeannette MacGruder—up front on their own records. Parlet dropped their album *Pleasure Principle* first, if “first” matters when it’s that close. Anyway, if you don’t know *Pleasure Principle* you should. It’s out there. That original lineup was Debbie Wright and Jeannette MacGruder, with Mallia Franklin joining on at the end of the session. Debbie left before the follow up, 1979’s *Invasion of the Booty Snatchers*. That album started with a lineup of Mallia Franklin, Jeannette Washington, and Shirley Hayden. Mallia left and was replaced by Janice Evans—some Mallia was left on the album though. They killed this one, too. Straight fire outta Parlet for real. \n\nThen, 1980 hit. Casablanca was collapsing. The P-Funk collective was gettin rocked but Parlet keeps that stable lineup with Janice, Shirley, and Jeannette. And they’re about to blow up—you can feel it. So on the back of *Booty Snatchers* and insane tour success they take to the studio to record their masterpiece: *Play Me or Trade Me*. It’s their way of telling the world it’s now or never. Fire track after fire track. Insane soul. Falsetto’s out the ass on this. We’re keying up two singles on this one because it’s too much heat. And nothin. We flop. Most stuff I’ve read points to financial problems depleting the promotional budgets—I think Universal was involved but I don’t know all the details—with Parlet joining a bunch of other projects in obscurity if only because no one bought the ad space. \n\nAnd that sucks, man. There’s too much good here. Play me or trade me. Let’s go. \n\nThe opener, “Help From My Friends,” is a bouncy tune, particularly that piano deep in it, and the rubbery,  brassy horns, the rolls on the hi-hat (Kenny Colton on the drums here keeping it cool). The wide melodies from our Parlet Ladies—Jeannette, Shirley, and Janice—washes over you like a wave. And what I love about the P-Funk ladies and George’s work with them is that it really leans on that juxtaposition. The tide-like, flowing vocals against the sharpness of the guitar, synth shots, handclaps, the punchy bass. They’ll reverse the formula at the outro, after a cool, extended break. They’ll go and let the synths be the tide drowning out the sharp chants: “Can I get a little help / From my friends?” Something so big about it. I read somewhere that George said something like this lineup was the best at that trademark, P-Funk mix of soul and sex. And you hear it here like a Siren song between deep Funk grooves. It’s real dope.\n\nMost of the album—everything but the opener and the closer in fact—has way more than just out three Parlet singers on board. “Watch Me Do My Thing” leads with the ladies but in that sing-song, rhyme-y kick P-Funk really owned outright. We got Bootsy on bass, Catfish on guitar, David Spradley on keys, love that combo, and it starts real noodle-y before getting real thick, real fast. The synth solo is wild, man. Spradley rips. All that, plus the addition of some real cool, very chill horn accompaniment from the newly-constituted P-Funk players (that’s gonna be Bennie Cowan on trumpet, Greg Thomas on the sax, Greg Boyer on trombone), makes for a wildly underrated P-Funk jam, man. The rhythm on this digs deep, Tyrone Lampkin stomping the drums the whole way. \n\n“Wolf Tickets” was the higher charting of the two singles off this. We need room to dig this one. George gets a vocal feature on it. Everyone gets a vocal on it, and the crew really chops it up alongside our Baltimore Connection (aka the P-Funk horns) plus Maceo. Jimmy Ali on bass, Kenny Colton on drums, Jerome Ali on guitar: I dig this combo with Parlet. There’s a brightness to the rhythm with them, fresh air in it, but steady on the one. Sort of hinting at four on the floor and heightening the dance-ability on the track. Truth be told the whole thing feels like it’s about to fall disco in the chorus—chimes and all—but it’s a groove for real, even if it holds off on real grit until the key solo. Jerome’s guitar underneath there, counter to it, really, brings it. That Funk. “Where it is?” It’s inside that soulful, gospel vocal toward the close, smacking down the brass and hitting a big downbeat. DAMN. The vocals carry us out then. They weave in and out each other. In and out the horns. But really it seems like we’re meant to dance this one out. As far as dance tracks go? P-Funk dance tracks? This one’s got to be up there. Someone link it if I forget.\n\nFlip it to side B. We’re taking this track by track.\n\nGeorge must have been on a dance kick in ‘80, because the other head writing credit he gets after “Wolf Tickets” is this one, “Play Me Or Trade Me.” The rhythm section (Kenny Colton on drums, Donnie Sterling on bass, Gordon Carlton on guitar), give it James Brown levels of urgency but it’s all got a dance floor edge. More wiggle than thump on the bass. A little dapper with the hi-hat, and the guitar just chugs. The vocals get a lot of space on it to vamp, too. The ladies make the most of it. Very cool and sparse, bringing attitude in the break and layering it thick. Four or five parts weaving rhythmic in some places. Melody cuts through now and then but really the mics have their own jam going. The vocal takes the track, more so than anywhere else on the album, so much so that there’s little left for the rest of the crew to do on it. It’s the statement track from Parlet. Hear it, man. \n\nAnd those vocals kill again on the next one, “I’m Mo Be Hittin’ It.” Real sexy, sometimes distant. Holding you captive. And the riff man, something ominous about it. The synth layered on that falling bass. After the intro when it thins out to make room for the handclaps, the percussion: that’s raw. Heavy. And there’s this sense of heaviness in the foreground the whole time, you know? The bass and the kick are louder than distant horns and vocal notes, but then the vocals come right up front—cut through all of it, right through the noise—and they’re on you. On top of you. Inappropriately so. It’s a cool effect. And shout out Ron Dunbar. I don’t know much about the dude. He doesn’t do much crazy. But his dialog adds a cool layer to this one.\n\n“Funk Until The Edge Of Time” leads in with all three of the Parlet ladies in unison, “doo doo doo dooo doodoo.” Temporarily back into a comfortable jam space. A little dance-soul feel on it too as the horns go wide with the synths in the chorus, the bass line stretches into those held notes, but the core of this thing is the bubbly scratch deep in the mix, the pop and slide on the bass, and the plod of the drums. There’s always a tier of bigness and elegance Parlet can reach, but their home is deep in the Funk. They tell us: they “love to Funk around.” “Funk is what we love to play.” It’s a straight-ahead track, man. The new P-Funk horns match the vocal cool perfectly, and cool is what this one’s about. We’re taking a hard 5 because then? Then.\n\nThen we’re left with the closer, the big ballad. “Wonderful One.” And by this point, you know, despite how cool this whole album is, I personally feel like I never get the full range of vocal prowess the record promises, you know? But we get it here. All of it. Deep bass and synth wiggle in and then strings hit, chimes. It’s immediate. The girls are deep on the backing vocal, soft, and there’s a pure, soulful cut into the track: “I wanna hold youuu... mmmmmmm mmmmmmm mmm.” They wouldn’t play this game alone now. They’re passing the lead and everyone brings it big. I read somewhere recently that this new generation of kids has started clowning the old soul and R&amp;B singers for getting all worked up about mundane shit in their songs. (The funniest version is Sisqo having a mental breakdown over underwear.) But that’s what soul is. That’s the draw. The bigness over nothing. Give us the biggest version of an emotion possible just to get the point across. And Parlet does exactly that here, and in a tight 4:00. The whole song is “I wake up. I am in love with you.” But they’re pleading it. Jeannette, Janice, Shirley. Begging. The synth starts running high to plead to you too, a preview of the falsetto the Ladies are eventually gonna reach for. They kill it. Obliterate it. Minnie who? Mariah who? The whole track is a vibe, it runs on the snap of the hi-hat, bobbing, keeping us afloat, and the crew goes nuts on top of it—the synth and vocal vamp at the outro is cool as hell. Fade out on the long note. Gotta smile at the close. Yo. \n\nParlet quietly disbanded after the album failed to chart. It’s unjust. So dig this one how it should’ve been dug half a century ago.",

    "title": "Sly and the Family Stone - Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I’m Back (1976)",
    "content": "In 1975, Sly and the Family Stone played one final gig at Radio City Music Hall. They bombed,  man. And not in the way you’d expect. I mean, Sly had a reputation of missing something like one out of every three gigs he’s booked, leaving stage mid-set, all that. And he had that reputation for a while. Nah, the ‘75, Radio City gig went off as planned and on time. The remaining members of the Family—Rose, Freddie, Mary McCreary, Andy Newmark—all made it happen. But it was empty. Something like 1/8th capacity, from what I’ve read, and the writing was on the wall. \n\nMaybe it was just too much faith was lost by then. Maybe people soured on the erratic behavior. I don’t know. The albums were good. *Fresh* is probably a tight #2 for me behind *Riot.* But the juice was gone, man, and those who were still around after the Graham Central exodus a few years prior peeled off one by one. Went and did their own thing. Freddie had success following Larry. Rose had a solo career. Sly was definitively post-Family now. Definitely on another track. He wouldn’t see another song chart after the dissolution of the Family. \n\nSly kept recording though. And I’m here to tell you that it ain’t like there’s nothing there. He brought it. Still. A little uneven with the rotating cast of former Family members and new collaborators, sure. Rose pops up in the studio. The Brides of Funkenstein do. So does George Clinton. Peter Frampton even. Session musicians too. You see, Sly was multitracking like crazy from *Riot* onward, layering, adding tracks, re-mixing, re-mixing, re-mixing, trying to cement something, a statement maybe, with what would be his last two albums for CBS. First, he did it as a solo artist on High On You. Then, he did it under the Family name, an attempt to reconstitute it but to go beyond it it, too, to honor the rock roots, the gospel roots, the raw Funk in Sly’s roots, to find himself, I think, once more, in this one: 1976’s *Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I’m Back*. And, business-wise, it was a trainwreck. Only one single was released from the album, “Family Again,” the closer, and after it failed to chart, CBS released Sly, remixed the early hits as disco singles, and released the remix album *Ten Years Too Soon*. What a slap in the face.\n\nAnd it’s not even warranted. This is a decent album. I’d even call it good. The opening, title track, leads is in with a party scene, the gang’s all here, and it’s got this dope percussion section that’ll run from there through the background of the whole track. And that punchy, Latin-infused bass line that rides the percussion between verses is hard, man. But overall we’re riding a soft rock edge on this track. It’s especially evident in the flutes (those are held down by Steve Schuster). There’s a clear tension Sly wants to set up between the syncopated percussion on one side and the soaring, wide, melodic guitar in the verse. The bass (either Sly or Dwight Hogan) navigates it in real subtle way that I dig a whole lot. We get a real thickly layered vocal that leans soft rock too. You can hear Cynthia all over it. And that vocal in the bridge kills me, just repeating the line--“Heard you missed me,  baby / Well, I’m back”--and the lead into Sly’s vocal vamp at the outro, kills too. It’s got vintage Sly all over it. The purposeful tension constructed between verse and chorus, the optimistic pop sensibilities in the instrumentation. The unison, group vocals. A lot of the album is an exercise in pulling those family elements, that comfort zone, forward. I mean take the follow-up track, “What Was I Thinkin’ in My Head.” It calls back a melody and a vocal delivery I’m vaguely recognizing from, like, “Running Away” or something, but poppier than that, something off the *Greatest Hits*. I can’t place it but it’s familiar and it’s comfortable in those verses. A little boogie but there’s strings coupled with wide vocals, giant chords running over the whole thing like a fog. Then juxtapose the chorus. It’s almost a Gap Band chant. Punchy on the bass. Splashy on the drum kit. Chopped up brassy in the horns. And a long break. The groove in it calls to the verse a bit, softening the tension between those two, then all the backing vocals. It’s a good effect. Vintage Sly again, man. \n\nIf there’s one place where we see true vintage Sly in action though, really embodying the stuff he invented a decade prior, it’s the hooky-ness of these tracks. “Sexy Situation” brings it on that old school organ rock kick we got out of Sly back with the big hats and white suits. The vocal is delivered layered, not really melodic. It’s a funky sing-a-long as only Sly could do it. The guitar noodles wildly underneath, but you’re tapping along with the “uh huh” instead of focusing on that (or the synths and keys woven all through it, like a wall of distant, fuzzy funk coming at you). Or take “Everything In You Has To Come Out,” that hookiness slathered in gospel. Riding on those strings. So big it eclipses the quaint funk groove underneath it. “Let’s Be Together,” delivered in that high, boogie register, floating on top of an army of congas and a four-note walk of a bass line that’s going to splash and lay out in the chorus. Then the backing vocals. “Don’t. Stop. Stop, don’t. Don’t stop. Stop. Don’t.” Got P-Funk on it. The Brides. Just a bit over the top. It’s a highlight. “Gimme. Gimme. Gimme. I want. I want. I want.” You can’t not sing it. Vintage Sly. Again. \n\nWe get lots of vocal territory covered on this one, for sure. “Nothing Less Than Happiness” is bluesy, soulful. It swings. A gorgeous duet vocal between Sly and Lady Bianca, billed here as “m’lady Bianca.” A different thing. A soulful thing and a cool thing, but a different thing. “Blessing in Disguise” is another vocal showcase but this time it’s all Sly’s and it’s soaring. A real rock track out of this one. A cool moment toward the end where it’s the whole crew on a gang vocal but here it’s got some psychedelia on it, a little echo, a little bit of the heavenly, you know? It’s Sly going big in a way we don’t often see him do it, and really in the service of the melody. Not that it’s such super rich, but when you work around a vocal crescendo as that key element, the whole track has to work to up to that point. Chords change, keys come in, bass goes wide, strings, hit “BLESSIIIIIIIIIIIIIING” with the horns, drop out dramatically, strings out. Into the bridge, and even there its vocals driving the track. It’s cool shit. Grand in its coolness, even. \n\nOne of my favorite places I see Sly reaching on this though is in “Mother Is a Hippie.” It’s a wild track. The hi-hat is on hyper drive with this wiggly synth on it during a real, real cinematic open. That riff rips, man. But it’s punctuated by these verses in a rock idiom that have upbeats accented, almost a ska effect in between proggy, cinematic soul/funk. And it shouldn’t work, but it does. Sly has that landscape in front of him and he’s in control. He solos on it. He builds a bridge on it. He blends the disparate pieces together in a way that works and is inherently funky, a mix of that early psychedelia and that 70s monster funk that he hasn’t mashed up this way before. It’s a cool track. It moves a lot. It’s got a real proggy but soulful vibe as a result. It does more than a your standard 3-minute Sly track usually does. Dig that one for sure. \n\nBut the real Funk here, Sly showing why he’s Funk royalty, is on “The Thing.” GodDAMN. This is the thickness. It slaps. The little bass chord in the lick. The wide wah chord. The cowbell, steady. I mean of all instruments to tether us to the groove it’s that. And that’s on purpose. You want to be lost in the track--or at least the parts between the rising, cinematic choruses. Sly’s laugh. That affect. The horns holding chords, waaAAAaaaaAAAaaa. And the interplay of the vocals, Sly against the backing chorus. He’s on one with this groove. And that bass, man. Sparse but heavy when it hits those fills toward the close. It’s a depth of Funk Sly touches only a couple times in his discography and I’m actively telling you that this track is one of the Funkiest the man has. He might give you party organ now and then, but legit he’s on a strut with this. Where has this been sampled? Nowhere? Damn. \n\n At the end of the day, it’s the new that hits on *Heard Ya Missed Me*. It’s the new I want more of. And I think that’s where Sly is lost by the industry. CBS put out the wrong single. It should’ve been “Mother Is A Hippie” or “The Thing.” Even “Sexy Situation.” Instead, Sly wrote a song that’s supposed to be a reunion track but, nah. It’s the closer. The lasting impression. “Family Again.” A little voice box on it, a little electro blues right at the top, but then it’s all passing the vocal, unison, introducing the rhythm, zappety, zap zap, rattatatat, pass to the next vamp, the keys, the bass, “Sly gonna make you high.” It’s “Dance to the Music” for a different era, Sly trying to channel the whole family through himself. But there’s something missing. Maybe it’s because he can’t really pass the vocal when it’s just him in the studio? Maybe it’s the lack of extra brass with the sax? It’s busy but lonely, you know? The musicianship is great but there’s an emptiness to it. There’s no jam on it, is what it is. At one point we have keys positioned like they’re talking back and forth. Dialoging. You don’t feel someone building off someone else because it’s all Sly. It’s fine, but it’s forced, you know? And if Funk doesn’t come natural, you know it.\n\nSo, Sly tried to reinvent the family but as a one-man-band. The album title and the cover art show you it’s a solo album. The single tries to be something else. But if you can dig it for everything else, all the soaring soul, all the deep Funk, all the big rock melodies, this one has some real fire on it. So go ahead. Dig it.",

    "title": "Herbie Hancock - Thrust (1974)",
    "content": "If it’s OK, I’m gonna assume a lot of folks around here my age and younger might not know who Herbie Hancock is.  But Herbie Hancock—jazz pianist, keyboardist, synth pioneer—is the shit. \n\nDespite having zero formal training until his 20s, Herbie Hancock landed in Chicago immediately after college in Iowa and fell into Donald Byrd’s band (where DeWayne McKnight first took off) in 1960. And from there, man, a full sprint toward icon status. By ‘63 his album *Takin’ Off* was being talked about, putting his single “Watermelon Man” (the original version) out in the world and getting the attention of. Miles Davis. Before long, Herbie is bringing his early electronic work to Miles’s quintet, runnin’ and jammin’ with names like Ron Carter (prolific bassist every bassist should know), Wayne Shorter, Mtume Heath (yeah, the “Juicy Fruit” drummer), and Dewayne McKnight (yeah, that one). It’s an era of rhythmic backlash against the untethered, asymmetrical, bop freak-outs of the old school, and the future of Funk royalty are at the center of it. Herbie is at the center of it. \n\nSo while he’s in sessions with Miles, evolving from post-bop experimentation to the kinds funky, tweaky sort of tracks we get on *On the Corner* and *Jack Johnson*, Herbie’s also building new worlds with synthesizers and forming his own bands. The first is the super-spiritual, electro-centric, Afro-centric sextet Mwandishi. This shit is wild. It’s got Bennie Maupin playing a psychedelic bass clarinet on top of Herbie manhandling the insides of synthesizers. I love it. *Sextant* is my favorite album from this crew and you hear Herbie circling real funk, that “Chameleon” Funk. That Headhunters Funk. And that’s his second band. He kept Maupin and that wild-ass bass clarinet and then added bassist Paul Jackson out of the Bay Area funk scene and Harvey Mason (later replaced by Mike Clark) and Bill Summers on percussion.\n\nWeird crew. And they killed it. Immediately that first album, *Head Hunters*, sprints up the jazz charts and sits there for 15 weeks. “Chameleon” becomes a DJ staple. The album gets sampled to death. “Watermelon Man” becomes an iconic track yet again, this time entering Herbie and the jazz world into an era of new, rhythmic fusion that’ll somehow break the seal and put jazz cats on MTV for a hot minute. Real funky shit out of these dudes. In this first iteration, the Headhunters would go on to drop four albums under Herbie’s name—*Head Hunters* (1973), *Thrust* (1974), the live album *Flood* (1975), and *Man-Child* (1975)—before a long hiatus should send Herbie into much more commercial territory. \n\nAnd for some reason I’m obsessed with *Thrust* right now. I think it’s slept on, probably because we get “Chameleon” and “Watermelon Man” right before it,  and wah pedals and “Hang Ups” right after. You want proof? Actual Proof?\n\n“Palm Grease” starts with Mike Clark on the drums, laying it down thick. The kick drum comes at you a little muffled, and then the clarinet lays down on top of it. Talking to you, then talking to Paul Jackson’s bass line, noodling while the keys pluck and stab. It’s a thick groove and the moment it’s established we’re in a percussion break. All hand drums and steel drums. Just barrels through. There’s something theatrical about it but so down to earth too, you know? Bennie Maupin ends up swinging through with a pretty par-for-the-course sax line on top of layered synths—highly electric now—at about the mid-point. Highly syncopated there too. The bass drives a good bit of the groove now, too, rumbling along at parts, kind of digging in and guiding a chunk of the melody. The keys play off it, the sax plays against it, really Jackson at the center with the solos passing, divvied up between percussion breaks. Late in the track the synth sort of wears an echo on it and you get the sense of crescendo and of losing a little control. Just for a second it’s chaotic and then pulled back together. And it’s the bass, the wiggle in it, a quick slide, a note held just a second too long, latent compression on it, that makes it work. Then, deep deep, the wide, angelic, cosmic synth chords. Not a crescendo as much as divine intervention. Arrests the whole track and shuts it down. What a statement Herbie makes there, man. Allow me to shut this shit down. I can’t remember if it was Herbie or Miles who said something once about the appeal of Funk being the simplicity of the underlying elements—like you can go cosmic big on it, or full freak-out, but the foundations are universal, of the people. That idea is fully formed by the end of the opening track, you know? Herbie’s gonna take it to big, weird places, but he’ll hold us down to earth, keep us in the dirt, with the Funk. \n\n“Actual Proof” is the other half of side A. It was originally put together for a movie soundtrack for *The Spook Who Sat by the Door.* I don’t know anything bout it. “Palm Grease” was in *Death Wish.* I know a little about that. But “Actual Proof” is a jazzy, rumbling tune. Guttural on the bass, swinging on the drum kit in these sort of fluid, key-driven moments (Herbie highlights the Fender Rhodes on this one). And it’s got the sort of standard jazz hits—unison on the bass, the horns, the keys, the cymbals: ba ba baaa! It’s the most straightforward jazz tune of the four we get on *Thrust*. The funk really lives in the sparser bass, but even then Paul rambles, man. It’s got bop on it. And the whole track feels like the band setting up a bop and then barreling through it over and over again. More conflict than fusion. We get a relatively funky refrain but it’s a little stiff. Dig the riff though. And then it’s wide, cosmic keys flying in again, horns and woodwinds coupled with it this time. That push-pull between the stiff groove and that flowing melody really turns out to be a funky constant on this one. \n\n“Butterfly” kicks off the b-sides and is an easy favorite. It glides in on some rising string tones, all the silky smoothness of a bossa nova but not quite that. The bass comes melodic but against the drums it sorta manages to round out a groove, especially when it uncouples from the horn melody, and especially in the more syncopated, more rubbery moments. And that reed, man. Just solo wailing on it deep in the mix. Sparse in places too. It’s that and the strings, the synths, that carve a path but the rhythm--especially Bill Summers with the hand drums going opposite that snappy snare--owns the track. At one point Paul Jackson on the bass expands and wiggles it up, actively cutting against Bennie’s solo, getting almost too busy before a reset. \n\nEven the Herbie solo is mixed just under the lip of that punchy bass for most of the track. Like the string voice is layered four or five times so it can try to escape the current of drums but it doesn’t matter much. It takes more than that to break out and give that sort of electro-angelic bigness Herbie pushes with his synths and organs and all. It takes a second, bigger, track-ending Herbie effort. So he doubles down. He builds as he goes. He pushes. And far from the softness of the solo piano, now we got organs and synths in each hand, bringing those chords flying down on one side and going on an all-out sprint up and down and organ with the other. Summers jumps on with congas, pacing the whole thing, and then Mike Clark on the kit starts getting busy too. It’s a highlight of the record, punctuated all the more when we drop out into something a little more downtempo. A little moody. Echoes of the opening riff. Big bass notes. The reeds again. And a real lush, stringy voice on a synth again wiping that slate clean at the close. Every track is a techno wizardry mic drop, man. \n\nBut for my money the real solid Funk on this is found in “Spank-a-Lee.” Real low on the horns, I’m not even sure what Bennie broke out on this. A bass something just rattling rib cages on the one. The deepest one I’ve ever heard. Contrast that with a drum lick I swear I know from Tower of Power (remember that Bay connection) and some wiggly keys, a real wandering bass line—like dude is fully on his own journey—and it’s a thick groove, man. Everywhere you turn it’s someone sneaking a note, a hit, an accent. Real jam shit. Real jazz shit. Bennie’s sax solo seems to want to remind us that this is jazz, after all. Like all funk is jazz, after all. It gets into that cool, noir space before giving just a bit of repetition, after all, like it’s just on the edge of that real Funk, after all, the Horny Horns stuff, before it slips back into that free jazz space. It’s a jam that passes the combo effort more than the solo. It’s not clear who leads in any moment. It’s spontaneous, like factually so, at its best, and under that Bennie solo you can hear four limbs from Herbie bringing spontaneity on a whole army of keyboards. Multiple synth voices, pianos, organs, it’s a funky, free-jazz wall of sound. If you can dig it, you will, and if it ain’t your vibe, well to each their own. \n\nWe end up from there in this extended, syncopated break that’s bringing all the circularity and thickness of a funk groove but it’s just a bit shakey, you know? The horns wail. The congas pick up. The bass keeps steady on the high pops but eventually goes to sludge alongside some freaky keys, a squishy sound we’ll get more out of Herbie later in the decade but here just sounds alien, especially with such clean bass under it. Nah, the wild effects here are all digitized under Herbie’s hands. The other weirdness comes from centuries-old, rare percussion and reeds and woodwinds in hands of jazz masters. The core rhythm section though is classic Funk. And the play of those elements, man, that funky Afro-futuristic, free-jazz-matic, electro-traditional madness, that’s where you’re at with Herbie in this period. And this album, Thrust, is the best illustration of that tension. \n\nSo go on then. Dig it.",

    "title": "Earth, Wind, and Fire - Open Our Eyes (1974)",
    "content": "We all know the Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire single “Shining Star” off 1975’s *That’s The Way Of The World.* “You’re a shining star / No matter who you are, / Shining bright to see / What you could truly be.” It’s a banger in that positive-mental-attitude lane, that semi-angelic, high-register, good vibes funk. It’s the sort of track that took EWF into a tier of international, all-time, GOAT conversation that transcends anything we’ll talk about here.\n\nEarth, Wind, &amp; Fire thought the album was doomed though. Quick story: in 1975, Sig Shore, producer of *Super Fly*, approached EWF about working on a film project titled *That’s The Way Of The World.* More than the soundtrack though—which they would lock down control of—the group would also play a fictionalized version of themselves (“the Group”). And look, man. I haven’t seen it. I’ve read about it. It sounds bad. The whole movie is about a record producer played by Harvey Keitel who is producing for the Group (EWF) and then his boss or some station executive tells him no you have to prioritize this new act we signed, the Pages. And it’s a whole allegory about how the Pages are cookie-cutter and the Group is more real or whatever but also Harvey Keitel is in a relationship with a woman he hates or something? And I guess he marries her and somehow all the records get made. I don’t know. Somehow it sounds like confusing as shit but also like nothing happens. And EWF thought it was ass. They were so convinced the movie was ass, in fact, they rushed the soundtrack out before the movie was released. Give it a chance to sell something before the movie tanks any promotion, right? But nah. “Shining Star” goes bananas on the charts and EWF become the first black artists to top the Billboard 200 and the soul chart at the same time. \n\nBut let’s be clear now. That wasn’t especially crazy. I mean I love these stories about the unexpected single—an unexpected album—doing numbers. But Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire had already been putting up numbers. See, in 1972 they switched to CBS and immediately dropped jazzy, funky heater after jazzy, funky heater. Their 1972 album *Last Days and Times* went to #15 on the U.S. soul chart. 1973’s *Head to the Sky* would go all the way to #2 on the soul chart and they’d chart a single, “Evil,” off it too. Then, in 1974, the crew went back into the studio and capped off a crazy run with the Maurice-White-produced, kalimba-infused, afro-centric, jazz-rock-driven, soulful, worldly but cosmic, artsy *Open Our Eyes.* \n\nOpen?\n\n*Open Your Eyes* leads with heat. A heavy chord on the one that launches us into “Mighty Mighty,” the third single off the album but the one that would chart highest. The horns are wiggly as shit on it. Slick even. And the synths too, sometimes doubled up on the horns and sometimes on their own kick. It’s a groovy track. Steady too. Everyone sort of chugs along, you know? No terribly fancy fills. No big solos. A few interesting changes but not a step out of time to get it done. It’s a vocal track at the end of the day. The vocals shift from that crashing, crescendo high-end, to the in-unison, party vocal and back a couple times. And finally at the close they come together and it’s just a that fictional, near-Mariah-range falsetto out of nowhere. It’s wild.\n\nThe vocals get the driver’s seat a few times, in fact. The follow-up track, “Devotion,” also a popular single off the album, brings it very soulful, a little less ornate, feeling spiritual but in a mystical way. Al McKay, Verdine, Maurice, all in the background, airy, and Phil Bailey launches a cosmic falsetto off it. It has the shape of gospel but it isn’t that. It’s softer, airier. You hear that cosmic airiness  better in “Feelin Blue,” a track so jazzy it creeps up on bossa nova territory. They pass the vocal around but keep it in that ethereal space, setting us up for a sci-fi epic of a synth solo. Horns come in wind to help hold us down while these dudes do everything they can to send us into space. Shoutout to Al McKay’s guitar at the close of that one. \n\nAt the end of the record we get a couple more great vocal tracks out of “Caribou” and the title track, “Open Our Eyes.” “Caribou” is heavy on the organ, the whole vocal is scatted—no words at all—just sort of a Latin base underneath the airy vocal until, once again, Al McKay comes in and kills a guitar solo. Frantic this time with it. Very cool. And then yeah “Open Our Eyes,” the title track, is hands down the true vocal showcase. Gospel on it. Big ol’ melodies. Pianos layered on organs, long low notes out of the bass, just a slight clap of a hi-hat holding us down. And how cool the delivery of “open our eyes” is, that vocal, the “Oooo” under it. Beautiful. \n\nReal jazz hits in the medley made out of “Spasmodic Movements” and “Rabbit Seed” a frantic, experimental, tonal drum-and-chant sprint leading into swinging drums, punchy, walking bass lines, a virtuosic sax solo, and then a quick collapse of a fade-out into chants again. It’s a wild, impressionistic corner late in the record that’s a reminder of everywhere Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire come from, everywhere the funk tradition comes from. \n\nThere’s solid, thick-groove funk on this thing too. “Fair But So Uncool” reins the vocal in for the most part—the backing gets into the high stuff but we’re mostly down the middle on it otherwise—in favor of the percussion. Even the synths are traded in for pianos on this. We got a sea of congas and bongos that sort of hypnotize until Verdine’s bass snaps us out on that big drop beat. “Tee Nine Chee Bit” takes us to that space too, down to that dialog at the open. Street funk. The bass all staccato in the groove. The guitars layered, shredding almost blues-like. Pure funk. Old school funk. All drum and bass and commentary, inside the party. It’s the closest we see to party and bullshit out of Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire. \n\nBut the brand of Funk I’m into right now, what we get here that we don’t get enough of elsewhere, that jazzy, Afro-driven, syncopated funk, that first pops up in “Kalimba Story.” And “Kalimba Story” brings it now, with a little bit more of a rock edge maybe. Al’s guitar traces the vocal in the chorus and keeps it steady and thick in the verse. Verdine’s just marching, maybe a little strut in the changes. But the real story on that one is the kalimba, the African “thumb piano” Maurice got obsessed with and mainstreamed here. It’s a dope sound. Something aquatic about it to my ears. And he kills the solo on “Kalimba Story” and then again on the top of the b-side with “Drum Song,” a sort of afrobeat/jazz/folk hybrid that comes in movements. First it sprints at a pace that’s almost disorienting—the kalimba on its own. The main groove there is deep though, man. A shaker just digging the earth beneath your feet. For most of it. The kalimba groove circular and the bass chugging along, straying only now and then and only on the four, sort of gives it a sway, a two-part groove until the track turns into more of a jam. Tons of metallic percussion in here—not sure what it is but it’s deep and it’s wide for a minute. One of the coolest jazz-funk jams on record right here, absolutely. \n\nIf you stream it, a re-mastered version exists with some “previously unreleased tracks.” The best one is called “Ain’t No Harm To Moan.” But no matter where and how you dig it, go dig it heavy man. These dudes are too heavy not to dig.",

    "title": "Bootsy Collins - Ultra Wave (1980)",
    "content": "There’s a lot to be said about the Parliament-Funkadelic collective’s business model, right? Take a crew of like 30 and from that build a roster of acts, mixing lineups under new names. The Brides. Rubber Band. The Horny Horns. All kinds of solo projects. Release all these on different labels, in-house labels included. Everybody could eat. Everybody could go off on anybody’s record or single. One jam session could produce three albums for three acts led by three different cats on three different labels, all fundamentally the same lineup. And I mentioned a while back this story I heard about one of those kinds of sessions, a P-Funk jam in ‘75 that produced most of the tracks for *Funkenstein*, two different Funkadelic albums, and the debut for a new concept that George had (and Bootsy didn’t yet know about), Bootsy’s Rubber Band. \n\nMy hot take is that Bootsy’s Rubber Band is the best project in the P-Funk catalog, period. Four albums that explore the entire psychedelic range of the bass. Four albums of absolute funky, proggy, far-out, extraterrestrial, hypersexual, atomic Funk grooves. *Stretchin’ Out in Bootsy’s Rubber Band* (1976), *Ahh... The Name Is Bootsy, Baby!* (1977), *Bootsy? Player of the Year* (1978), and *This Boot Is Made for Fonk-N* (1979). You know a bunch of the singles. They get talked about around here: “Telephone Bill,” “Hollywood Squares,” “Munchies,” “Bootzilla,”“Psychoticbumpschool,” “Jam Fan.” Bootsy the frontman was long overdue. And Rubber Band—the combo of Bootsy, the Horny Horns, Catfish, Kash, egging each other on, pushing each other bigger—was the perfect vehicle, man. \n\nBut Bootsy wasn’t content to stop at the mythological bigness, the psychedelic monstrousness of those Rubber Band albums. Nah. In 1980, he’d find himself pushing in two directions in these P-Funk jams, recording two albums simultaneously and dropping them in the same week. The older of the two is a self-titled album for the legally re-named Sweat Band (formerly Rubber Band). It’s dope. To my ears it brings a smaller, more straightforward and danceable funk sound. The second, though? The second album would give Bootsy more of the reins, man. It would stay big. It would embrace the looming dominance of electronic themes, dip its toes into the burgeoning hip-hop scene, and keep those progressive, heavily referential structures in place, all while introducing the world to Godmoma, on this, 1980’s *Ultrawave*. Bootsy’ first solo record. \n\nLet’s go already. *Momma’s little baby loves short’nin, short’nin / Momma’s little baby loves short’nin bread.*\n\nThat folk tune, the melody of it, is where *Ultrawave* opens. It’s a folk song that dates at least to 1912. It’s played here on a rubbery synth tone. And this album as a whole is really going to be rooted in the traditional—traditional funk, traditional rock n roll, traditional folk—but only so it can present them in this brand new way. The Horny Horns are here. Fred Wesley is here. But this isn’t the horn-heavy, Parliament sound Bootsy was messing with before. It’s not even the psychedelic, monstrous funk of Rubber Band. Nah, “Mug Push” kicks in and we get the thick-wristed guitar but it’s all keys, synths, looooong bass notes, Bootsy’s rapping on it. Yaaaaaaaabba dabba doo! His name is MUG PUSH. Love this track, man, and an extra shoutout to Bootsy’s drumming on that outro. What a statement of an opener. \n\nThe thing that hits me most about the 80s, solo Bootsy sound is the under reliance on the Horny Horns. We lose a bit of that brassy bigness. You’ll catch Fred and Maceo deep in the mix but it’s a brand of funk that, true to the cliche, pivots hard to the keys and synth voices starting January 1st, 1980. “F-Encounter” is where that pivot is most apparent. We get Maceo on sax and flute, two trumpets from Richard Griffith and Larry Hatcher, Fred Wesley on trombone, and it’s just light seasoning they’re engaged in. One, small bit of flavor. At one point in an earlier break you can actually hear a line from the trumpets bubble up and then the keys echo it and smack it down. Those keys man, those synths. They’re the real force now. Mark Johnson takes this track and makes it wiggle. He lays claim to a whole lot of space and plays off damn near everybody. Like he’s stalking prey. There’s points I think Bootsy lets him cannibalize the bass line. Claiming the whole damn song. And if it’s not the keys taking up space it’s Godmoma on the backing vocal. On “F-Encounter” they deliver like they’re the other half of the horn arrangement. High-pitched “Oooooooooovertiiiime” crashes down into the brass and then the follow-up line “For lovers only...” jumps back off the trumpet. Those little details get me. \n\nWe creep up to that big, horn-heavy, classic Parliament sound in a few places though. Straight throwbacks to “Mothership” show up in “Mug Push,” and so does a bit of a nod to Funkenstein’s “I get so hung up on bones.” But for a full track “It’s A Musical” might be the closest. The horn riff guides the guitar and bass from the jump and it’s a brassy sound, man. A whole marching band it sounds like in there. Bootsy and George share the lead vocal. The Brides (not credited as such) got the backing. And the bass carries that Bootsy-standard wetness but skips a bit still. Bootsy’s drums are a little splashy, too. It’s a nice mix. And there’s a moment deep in the break where the bass just sort of starts sliding. Just up. Down. Bootsy steps out and observes the party. Catfish keeps chugging along. Nothin but a party, y’all. And then, for the funk of it, this wild, cinematic, brassy outro. Come on, now. But then, that’s it. Outside of those, Fred and Maceo don’t make an appearance. \n\nWhat we get is “Is That My Song,” a straightahead but very cool piano blues tune that feels like a wild throwback that’s serves as a vocal highlight, both Bootsy’s cartoonishness and the smooth backing vocals out of Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent. And we get “Fat Cat,” a track that lets Parlet, the Brides, Peanut and them take that horns out of the mix so entirely that t’s voices and a rolling snare that end up taking up big real estate early in the track. David Spradley brings an outright seizure of a synth bass line just because, it seems. But when you clock it leading into the late breaks it hooks you. The track sort of shifts electro for a minute, then we really cook out of the break. The bass, drums, vocals all roll. Catfish takes a solo, just noodles up against that synth, feeling itself. \n\nAnd we get some throws to that Rubber Band sound. “Sacred Flower,” my personal favorite, goes full psychedelia, almost making “Fat Cat” look new wave in comparison. We’re a little on that “Telephone Bill” cadence for a second, and then we bring echoes of the “I’d Rather Be With You” riff, then that “Telephone Bill” riff is copped. And Bootsy mixes references wildly throughout the album, but here he’s getting it all. He stretches his references, raps over them, noodles over them, yells at a dog over them. And instead of horns we get an electric flute, not a huge presence but noticeable among the digital noise underneath. But really it’s the deep, distorted bass tone that sells this track. Toward the end we get it almost fully computerized but raw, half thrash fuzz and half dial-up static, and the vocal echoes it, a deeply human wail run through a phone jack. It’s like no matter what funk Bootsy brings in the eighties, that experimentation is pulling him further and further to that electro, proto-rap lane. \n \nAnd that lane is best filled by the closer, “Sound Crack.” The low-end distortion id carried over, layered in synth voices and bass tones, popping out for a second before retreating to such a cloud of keys I can only think of it as melodic static. That futuristic soundscape builds underneath a semi-melodic chant out of the regular cast of backup vocalists and Bootsy, the rhinestone rockstar, just struttin’ on it. A bit of the way in he’ll elevate it, bring chimes in for some soaring female vocal accompaniment, but then it’s back under. Deeper. Chord changes like that keep creeping in, chimes in and out, keys shifting lanes, Bootsy on guitar on this just noodling throughout. Bootsy on drums building to the longest crescendos only Bootsy can reach, pure fills and urgency. Bootsy on bass holding it down steady. Cracking inside jokes only he, the drummer, and the guitarist are really in on, you know? It doesn’t even end on beat. \n\n*Momma’s little baby loves short’nin’, short’nin’ / Momma’s little baby loves short’nin’ bread.* Take your dead ass home and dig it.",

    "title": "Prince - Dirty Mind (1980)",
    "content": "In 1979, Rick James set off on his first headlining tour. This was for *Fire It Up*, which dropped a year or so before *Street Songs*. Rick was ascendant, and he was about to become the icon of the 80s we know him as. He needed an opener that would, meet the insanity of the Rick James stage show, one that would match the energy without overshadowing it. Management thought they found it in a newer, Midwest club act with the government name of Prince Rogers Nelson. \n\nYou know him as Prince. The Artist. The Artist Formerly Known As Prince. The Love Symbol. The Androgynous One. But at the time he was Prince who had just dropped his sophomore, self-titled album and was ready to promote it somewhere bigger than the Twin Cities club circuit. So he was out there for a bunch of dates with Rick. But he was also learning. And working.\n\nThere are a ton of stories about the Fire It Up Tour and the feud that developed between them during the tour. And I’m not here to adjudicate it. But a few anecdotes stand out. Prince stole Rick’s moves and performed them at subsequent dates. Prince had his body guard put him on his shoulders and walk through the crowd during Rick’s sets, taking attention of the stage. Rick’s mom asked for an autograph and Prince said no. Truth be told it was probably more of a competitive thing than anything. There’s plenty of evidence as early as the autograph thing that they were cool enough with each other, even if Rick talked a little trash and Prince stoked the drama just for fun. Prince gave Rick’s mom that autograph. They hung at awards shows. Prince might have crashed parties with an entourage and Rick might have thrown cognac at him but, you know, there’s respect there. Well... mostly...\n\nIn any case, Prince wasn’t just honing his stage craft on Rick’s tour. He was actively writing a new album of material for his new band--André Cymone on bass, Dez Dickerson on guitar, Gayle Chapman and Dr. Fink on keys, and Bobby Z on drums. Half the songs would start from scratch on this tour and round out this album, one of the funkier selections in the Prince discography, 1980’s *Dirty Mind.*\n\nThe opening, title track, “Dirty Mind” ain’t funk. It’s funky in its composition--no chorus, kinda marching along--but it’s straight pop. Synth pop really. The rising vocal in the verse is the closest we get to a structure, sort of looping us back in turn. And Prince sells it with that voice. The falsetto. Silky smooth, distant until the urgency. That urgency makes the song. It makes the drums make sense. It makes the lack of Funk, itself, a little funky. And this album is really Prince poking around the edges of funk while he settles on that Minneapolis sound. Part of that sound is of course the dominant keys and synths, and yeah, this opening track is the creation of Doctor Fink himself, a staple of Prince’s backing bands, who brings it with that riff. Ice cold. The four on the floor underneath holds it down, the percussion as a whole really. It’s an icy, spacious, ethereal track if not for the drums marching along. Just a little too staid for the Funk. \n\nNow, we do get that beat echoed in a funkier way with “Uptown” later on. And yeah man this track slaps. It’s that disco 4x4 but more on it. More latched onto it, riding it. The bass is reserved but it’s got a bounce off the kick, that up-down-up-down a bit. The guitar--thicc with two c’s when Prince is on it--fill out a lot of the remaining space. And when it does, we get some stand-out moments for real. Classic Funk. And that against the synth-heavy moments, Frankenstein voices for real, the track is loaded, man. After all that we still get the long break, a little vocal vamp on it, layered still, some kicking around on the drums. Yeah man we get into party territory. As is expected Uptown. \n\n“Do It All Night” makes a stronger case for that real Funk. Earned Funk. Cements the Funk. It starts in the bass line, underneath some juxtaposed pieces, spacey synths and clean guitars, sultry lyrics and a punky riff on the keys against it all. Funk rhythms are deep in there. The key slides seem to hit just off-center from the bass line, and that line itself seems to wiggle just out of time when it climbs up. It’s a dance number for sure, with plenty of rhythm to latch onto. It’s subtle and I dig it. The Fonkiest shit though? “Head.” Yeah, man, that definition of the word. Yes. This man brings it heavy on this one. He tones down the synth voice to bring it a little more raw and we get that reflected heavy in the slap bass--those plucks got grit. And both of those are layered on a solid beat man. Prince can get reserved on the kit, a little more reserved than I like, and he does it here a bit too,  but the fills and the late handclaps fill out a nice, wide rhythmic base for the track. It sets up a solid break, and demands an absolutely bizarre, scatological, ecstatic synth solo--extraterrestrial, man. What a weird, funky track. \n\nLots of good funk and lots of great vocals across them. Great keys, filling out that Minneapolis sound. But it’s dirty, man. All the brightness and genius and it’s a filthy, filthy album. “It’s you I want to drive,” Prince basically moans in the opener, and he’s going to dance around it some more in the follow-up, “When You Were Mine.” “You let all my friends come over and meet” and “you didn’t have the decency to change the sheets.” DAMN. Cold. Filthy. And it’s Prince’s filthy mind, juxtaposing those lyrics and the bright, glamorous, keyboard-driven bop that is all him. Lead, backing vocals, synths, guitars (that clean guitar tone kills me more each listen), bass, drums. All him. The dirtiest, filthiest shit though? “Sister.” Yes it’s about that. It always is with Prince. (“Incest is everything it’s said to be.” Wtf man.) But after a solid, wide rhythm painstakingly established in “Head” he follows with a sprinted punk rock track with no stable time signature to it at all. Just pounding that clean guitar, bringing early punk into the mix with it. Five beats here. Seven on that. Two there. Four there. You can’t take it too seriously and you aren’t supposed to. Just shocks for the hell of it. \n\nBut Prince also brings it more sincere, downtempo, a little soulful. “Gotta Broken Heart Again” croons at you. It’s chill and it hits. It’s full, wider and more forward on the guitars than the rest of the album, really, and a valid complaint might be we want more of this sound on the album. Even one more soul track. The R&amp;B intonation in the vocal plays nice with those guitars. Layered vocals spinning out from the progression. It’s a cool track. The most straightforward one on here, maybe. \n\nThat leaves the closer. “Partyup.” Morris Day wrote this one. Prince wrote a bunch of Time tracks in return. It’s on the level. It’s another true Funk track. Not quite as thick with it, but solid, layered in the riff. The bass leans a little melodic on it, the keys are a little wider, the backing vocal is a reserved, the effects aren’t egregious (that cartoon effect adds melody now), but it’s still got grit to it. The chant. The breakdown. The range of percussion brought in. The slick riff between the guitar and the keys. It’s a deep groove, man. Deep in it you get a high-pitched pulse out of one side of the keys, and then that same element just shoots to the top loud leading into every verse. Prince brings punk to the table with his funk. And that punky vibe extends on this into one of my favorite moments in any song, the chanted outro: “You’re gonna have to fight your own damn war / Cause we don’t wanna fight no more.” Just a shaker behind it. \n\nSay what you will about feuds, egos, personalities, Prince is bringing poignant, punky, filthy brilliance inspired by greatness before him, and that includes the greatness, the filthy poignance, of Rick James immediately before him. Yeah he studied. Yeah he copped moves. Yeah he wrote half this record in hotel rooms immediately after watching Rick from the shoulders of his bodyguard. This is the great record born of all that. And it’s damn good, man. Dig it.",

    "title": "Rick James - Bustin’ Out Of L Seven (1979)",
    "content": "In 2004, Rick James became a proper introduction to funk for yours truly. And yes, it was Dave Chapelle’s “I’m Rick James, bitch!” that did it. From there into the world of internet piracy many went. “Super Freak” is estimated to be on 10% of mix CDs from the era. But for every second of irony the Rick James resurrection year produced, there were (and have been sense) hours of genuine excellence uncovered, revisited, enshrined. And Rick knew that would be the trade-off. He signed on to that infamous Chapelle skit. “Cocaine’s a helluva drug” was his line. It’s funny. It is. And in return for feeding the meme machine with that he got his name back in the culture, a few gigs with Teena Marie, and then the Teena duet at the 2004 BET Awards: “Fire and Desire.” Goddamn.\n\nIf you haven’t seen it, you should. I’ll put a link in the comments. Rick’s voice is rough. Years of hard living on it. But he’s in his element. All that soul. All that don’t-give-a-damn attitude. The showman is there. But the comeback wouldn’t happen. He’d pass before the end of ‘04. How much promise went unrealized? How many times? What does this have to do with *Bustin’ Out Of L Seven*? I don’t know. Do a time travel visual montage: it’s ‘04 and he’s killing the BET awards, before that it’s drug arrests and other sensational details on his record, before that it’s album flops, a lone dance hit, before that it’s *Glow*, praise, accolades, he’s smoking weed on stage in the 80s, “She’s super freak-kay,” before that it’s the early tours, Prince opening, and before that it’s this. 1979’s *Bustin’ Out of L Seven*. \n\nWe got there. So. “alright you squares, it’s time you smoked / Fire up this funk and let’s have a toke.” That’s the opening to the lead, title track—the big single—of this album. It’s a thesis statement, an argument of the power of the Funk to break you out of squaredom. It’s a party track too, Rick’s bass bopping around with a touch of wah on it, that wetness amplified by a deep, subterranean bass solo. The vocal range is meant for the singalong. The backing vocals (Teena among them) spoken. And the horns, man, the bigness, the brightness, it’s got that P-Funk on it. Rick’s doing a lot of the arranging on the horns with someone named Pete Cardinelli. I don’t know much about the dude. But together they bring the party on these horn lines. \n\nBigness is what Rick knows, even in his early work. The pace of the follow-up track, the  “High On Your Love Suite / One Mo Hit (Of Your Love),” has you at a full sprint. The bass and piano somehow keeping melody at that speed, and then crash off the guitar into a Fernando Harkless sax solo. He channels early funk with it. That JBs style. It’s dope. The percussion break—Shonda Akeem on the hand drums, steady vibraslaps, synth and echoes of those horn arrangements—those damn horn arrangements—you lose your spot in the groove, man, the whole outro. \n\nAnd of course the bigness of a Rick James album is half in the slow jams. On the a-side we get my favorite, “Spacey Love.” Rick summons it with a sub-two-minute “interlude” track that’s all lonely noir trumpet, distant dialog and lush piano. It’s a vibe. A woman’s voice comes to the top of the mix... chimes... drums, toms, stumble down into—yeah, there it is: “Spacey Love.” When Rick’s voice kicks in it’s all lift off, man. The piano. The drums fall out. The bass is Rick’s lead instrument. The effects on it are insane. And, oh, that’s Dorothy Ashby playing harp. It’s the perfect backdrop to the perfect R&amp;B pleading, gear dudes are gonna shift into a decade later, all baggy suits in the rain. Rick has the copyright on that. And the way he lets the piano and synth chords punctuate each syllable with a drop as the track grows... and Dorothy comes back on the harp on the side-b arena ballad: “Jefferson Ball,” too. Wide, piano chords at the open, big drums—almost sounding like a timpani back there playing opposite the softness of the harp and the backing vocals (Teena again among them). And the whole thing is delivered in this sort of swaying waltz, the bass swinging back and forth before punching into the chorus. It’s a big, wild moment that only Rick could pull off, and he’s brilliant for it you know? Putting a waltz-y ballad and some damn harps on a funk album... and “Jefferson” is the longest track on the album so it’s all earned, down to the sparse rap—Rick James vamping under Rick James talking to you, sensually. Then a long fade out. But not long enough. \n\n“Cop ‘N’ Blow” kicks off the b-side. It’s a dance track, flutes and handclaps and all, and Rick’s vocals get a bit of a workout on it too. The backing vocals sort of ride piano chords, but Rick brings range, especially in the chorus, sort of talking through some lines and then jumping right to the wail: “BLOW.” Harkless takes another solo here and it breathes a bit more—a little more jazz on it. Walli Ali takes a guitar solo right after and it sits side-by-side the percussion in the break and brings us somewhere totally separate. Some brand new disco space for just a minute. And he’s gonna bring us back here with the closer, “Fool On The Street.” Back to the dance floor and back with the flutes. This time a guitar wiggle under it. A bit of a rock oriented chorus. Rick is putting everything he’s got on this one, string arrangements, synths, layered vocals, it’s a lush song, which puts it back in that disco arena. And the kick drum knows it’s there, not quite a 4 on the floor but close, making it all the more whiplash when the Latin-tinged measures kick in, bridges and breaks and solos, then the horns lift us 10,000 feet and launch. Big choral vocal. Heavenly. Then back down to earth, percussion back in, Rick’s guitar soloing, the flute chugging along under the backing vocals, picking up the pace little by little, and the trumpet, man... Rick brought it all out for the closer and he leaves us with a skit. One last thing to bring to the track I guess. \n\nSo won’t you please, won’t you please / Tell me something good, tell me something bad / Make me feel happy, baby, make me feel sad / Do with me what you please, I’m begging on my knees. Dig this one.",

    "title": "Average White Band - AWB (1974)",
    "content": "In 1971, a bunch of struggling Scottish musicians who knew each other from home bumped into each other by chance at a Traffic gig in London. OK, not “struggling,” really. That’s the Hollywood version. Truth be told they were doing OK. Roger Ball and Malcolm Duncan, a.k.a. “the Dundee Horns,” were with a decent jazz-rock band called Mogul Thrash. Bassist Alan Gorrie and guitarist Onnie McIntyre were with a prog group called Forever More. Onnie and drummer Robbie McIntosh had done session work with Chuck Berry. But old musician friends reunite so what do you do? Set up a jam. No idea how Scottish prog dudes got there but the apocryphal story goes that the jam turned funky and a hanger-on at the session remarked with--hear the Scottish accent when you read this--“This is too much for the average white man.”\n\nHence the name. \n\nNo idea if that’s true, but it should be. This group would go on to catch their break opening for Clapton in ‘73 when Clapton’s then-manager signed them to Atlantic Records. And then, at Atlantic, they recorded this, their breakthrough: 1974’s *AWB*.  Now, before we jump in, respectfully: a band of white, Scottish, prog-rockers turned massive funk hit factory for a minute? That’s crazy, right? But it’s real. Now let’s get it. \n\nThe big hit in question on this, that one single we all know, is “Pick Up The Pieces,” and it’s mostly instrumental. It’s horn-heavy funk on a thick, JB’s-inspired guitar riff.  And the horns get it, finally get the light, in formation but not too tight. Hitting a groove opposite the bass line and going bright, resonant, big when it needs to. And the sax solo kills! Off those first vocals. The bass and keys open up the groove underneath it and it goes man, just whips you around. That’s Molly Duncan on the solo. Dope instrumental. Then the follow-up track (also the b-side on the 7” singles and posted here just yesterday I think), goes smoother, a little more soulful. “Person to Person” it’s called. I dig it. It’s slinky. The bass line plays this little chord and slides in the groove and I love that. The organ sort of mimics it in a few moments, plays opposite elsewhere. The guitar’s then in some third space. It’s a thick groove, man. The breakdown, that open-air drum into the tiptoe bass, that’s gonna seal it for me on this one. But it is on the smooth side, now. \n\nAnd that’s the thing that always strikes me about AWB and *AWB*. They hit different registers of “smooth.” Different lanes. Like they have range but the sensibility is in often in that same space. The opener, “You Got It,” leans smooth-jazz smooth. The bass line chugs rather than moves and the fills are wide. It’s keys and strings taking up the whole lane. The shared lead vocals are pure ‘70s mainstream rock. The horns are there but distant, fuzzy. More complementing the big easy rock vocal than anything. Robbie keeps a respectable groove on the drums and keeps us grounded. A track like “Work to Do” (the Isley cover) is gonna do the same on the horns but let the guitar do the chugging. The big rock vocal with those orchestra horns. It’s that smoothness, soulfulness in the AWB melodies. You recognize it. It’s there again in the bright, clipped guitars and soulful vocals on “Nothing You Can Do” and “Keepin’ It to Myself,” complete with bouncy little bass lines and intermittently swaying and rising horns. Again in “Just Wanna Love You Tonight,” that pure soul with the drawn chords, the vocals weaving and then locking in. \n\nThe smooth edge is their go-to, but it’s not their only speed. “I Just Can’t Give You Up,” moves at a real clip. It’s got some arena on it. Some 70s rock horns. Robbie’s drums cook on it and the guitar solo, Hamish’s solo, goes psychedelic. And got the love is cool funk (*woo!*), with Gorrie’s bass moving a bit and McIntosh’s drums really grooving man--just giving free lessons. The punchy fills from him make this track for me, but that bridge is a close contender too. Hamish Stuart takes the lead on this and the vocal kills, man. The way the bass plays inside the bigger belts is real cool, noodle-y. But then a little break and it sinks, the band drops away. The whole song is a vibe and you wish it was longer. \n\nThat leaves the closer. “There’s Always Someone  Waiting” starts on some “Doing It To Death” guitar work but it’s plodding now. Sparse at the open. All limping drums and staggered deep notes against the riff. I really dig this track. Gorrie’s vocal gets lead billing. The push-pull between the bass and guitar throughout sends me. The psychedelic effects kill me. The underwater vocal toward the end, man is bringing blues-rock, bringing Zeppelin to the table, it very cool. It’s gospel-tinged, punching up that JBs influence. Even when it locks in you get the sense that the vocal has to pull each instrument in to keep them falling off the sidewalk, you know? The break after the first chorus is where this song is made. Those high bass notes. The drawn out guitar wiggle. That’s where we really set the tone for the back half the track, which for a split second is going to sound like early Funkadelic. Just a second. Nothing serious. But you’ll give these dudes their laurels by the time the bass drops one last time and the needle lifts. \n\nThat’s a damn good Funk record. \n\nNow, a sad coda on this one is necessary. A month after its release, drummer Robbie McIntosh would die of a heroin overdose. 24 years old. But their follow-up album, *Cut the Cake* would be dedicated to him and be a major hit. And his drumming would be honored in a tribute track by the J.B.s. This is real: they released a single under the band name AABB, or Above Average Black Band, titled “Pick Up The Pieces One By One,” mimicking the original throughout.\n\nI dunno man. If the J.B.s wrote ‘em a tribute track there’s something there right? Right? Dig it.",
