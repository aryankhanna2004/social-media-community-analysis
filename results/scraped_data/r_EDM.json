    "content": "I was recently listening to \"Out of Time\" by Zedd. I think in terms of composition it's an interesting song and it kind of gives me old school Zedd vibes. I hadn't really heard about his new album at all and then I noticed that the song only has like 500k views on YT (the other Telos songs have similar numbers), which I think is a pretty steep drop off when you consider that there are many Zedd songs that generate at least millions of views if not hundreds of millions.\n\nGiven that Zedd is - I would say - pretty much a household name in EDM, do you think that he has just generally become less popular or do people just not like his newer music?",

At roughly 10:15 pm the good ole Evacuate Festival Grounds… stay calm notice popped up on stages. They opened an extra gate for people to exit and from there they did nothing. When asked for help staff told you good luck. Cars stuck left and right and the only people willing to help them get unstuck were other festival goers, not staff because they were nowhere to be found. Medical emergencies going unattended not to mention when the festival shut down they shut the water stations down so you better hope you either had water or were able to get to somewhere with it quickly which seldomly was the case. Disco Donnie and Disco Presents need to be held accountable for this disaster that unfolded this past weekend. \n\nSign the petition to fight for what’s right: https://c.org/Pdjpn5rNLT",

Mac has been a pillar in the dance music scene since the 90's and is a legendary producer and DJ. He started Fierce Animals records and Dark Star Audio and, as one does when a business grows, he brought on an intern- a once long time friend of mine- taught him everything it takes to be a successful music producer and DJ, only to be sued when he wanted to part ways after his wife was sexually harassed by said intern. \n\nThis person is still in our community DJ'ing and throwing events while simultaneously trying to take Mac and his wife's house- the roof over his daughter's head, their car, anything he can get- after draining Mac's life savings in lawyer fees.\n\nMac needs your help, and as his best friend, I need your help. I almost never ask for help, nor money, but in this critical moment I ask that you give whatever you can to help my friend, his wife, and kid to fight back against another all-American ambulance-chaser looking for a payout.\n\nIf you can't give, please share this post.\n\nGoFundMe link:\n\n[https://gofund.me/8ef3d4c1b](https://gofund.me/8ef3d4c1b?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBEwUkJmbnpadkdDYjA3TUdvaQEelpFie4vnjRKTK15JLsAkgd6u-yv5ewgkEt_4KRxCbkkRW6CHjD5Rp7IGOWs_aem_SEjAdIn4byMgTqJ67PPGLg)",

Also how is the comfort? I know I can try them myself and am planning to, but just wanted to see if anyone had any recommendations. Thanks",

Female vocal, mid-tempo house/trance (≈128 BPM), no piano, with a “cute” synth melody in the middle along with heavy bass. Even though the lyrics may seem a bit melancholy, I always felt the song had an almost happy/uplifting vibe. \n\nKey lyric fragments (I might be mishearing some words):\n\n* “Will I just follow down the road with you” / “If I could follow down the road with you”\n* “Open up a box of your illusions” \n* “So many words (worlds?) come pouring down my windshield”\n* “Will I just follow, follow, follow…” (trailing off)\n\nanother user from the tranceaddict forums posted about this song in 2008 saying they remember it on a VA CD (not a single/artist release). If anyone owns late-90s/early-00s VA trance/house CDs (Ministry/Cream/Trancemania/This Is Trance-style comps) \n\nThank you so much!!",

Colors start bleeding into the sound, he’s looping someone’s voice from the audience, and you can’t tell if you’re dancing or floating. It’s messy, emotional, and completely beautiful.\n\nOne trip pulls you into the cosmos. The other pulls you into yourself.\n\nWhich one are you choosing?",

Spotify seems to have me stuck on the same curation/rotation for most of the curated playlists, and thus, sort of having trouble getting exactly what I am looking for.\n\nIdeally I want to put together about an hour playlist of ultra-euphoric / epic songs that made your brain melt when you heard them live in a festival setting the first time. Go Back by John Summit, Sub Focus is exactly what I'm looking for. Start out chill, escalate, make your spine tingle a bit, not overly fast tempo but absolutely build up to an epic ripper.\n\nHopefully that vibe makes sense.

Thank you!!!\n\nEDIT: all 3 DJs seem to have consistent, positive feedback, but since I have seen Chris Lake more than once, I’ve decided to go for Royce &amp; Walker and Green Velvet this time around.

So I decided to creating my own music, from which I would like to share the very first track:\n\nManifest — One Single Thing That Will Break the Siege\n\nInspired by the Star Wars Series “Andor”, Manifest is a cinematic techno odyssey — an anthem for courage, unity, and uprising.\n\nIn an age where imperial systems once again tighten their grip, where truth is fractured, freedom questioned, and control disguised as order, Manifest stands as both reminder and call to resist. Inspired by Nemik’s words, it transforms the spirit of rebellion into sound, echoing far beyond fiction.\n\nBeneath its driving rhythm and evolving synth lines lies a quiet conviction: resistance begins within — often as a whisper before it becomes a roar. Each layer builds toward defiance; each break draws breath before striking back with renewed force.\n\nWhat begins as tension grows into momentum — the pulse of countless unseen hands pushing forward together. It is the sound of boundaries cracking, of people awakening, of freedom reasserting itself against fear.\n\nManifest is that heartbeat made audible — relentless, rebellious, resolute. And remember this:\n\nOne single thing will break the siege.",

    "content": "It’s something not too repetitive and gives something new to listen for throughout the song. I really do like how more melodic it is and how the synths create a lively night city aesthetic. I haven’t delve too deep into EDM as a whole. Most of the EDM music I find are from rhythm games. I’ve always appealed to the more melodic songs that have nice rhythm and interesting instrumentation that I can hyperfixate on. I do really care about every song having it’s unique sound while still giving a similar vibe.\n\nI do have two other songs that give a similar lively night feeling and was going to make a playlist of the songs I could find so I could eventually play them in a car while driving at night, but I really dont have an idea where to look. The artists for these songs are very niche and don’t have a big selection of songs. Hopefully I can find something nice here!",

I'm already aware of artists such as Cortese, Edapollo, Mild Minds, Fred Again, DJ Heartstring etc. but Kettama has his own sound. Underworld is actually the only artist I can think of who sounds like him and it's no surprise they've done collabs together. Any recommendations to his tracks like Take Me &amp; Man With The Second Face would be appreciated : )",

If anyone has any information about more of his songs or work, they could write here, I would be very happy.\n\nAnother question, could anyone transcribe what is said in this song? I have tried several AI tools but they cannot identify the lines. I'm from Brazil and I don't understand much of the English language, so it's difficult to know what is being said.\n\nI've been searching for this information since 2012, but I've never found anything...\n\nThanks guys.",

This show made me realize how much I love a good beat that only EDM can provide.\n\nI’ve tried playing audio of videos I took on Shazam with another device and it can’t recognize the songs.\n\nCan anyone help me identify the songs they played if I posted the video clips I have? \n\nAfter I get that information I might be able to put together a set list because setlist.fm isn’t helping me either.

It COULD be played by odymel, Pegassi, Marlon Hoffstadt etc but it’s more commercial. I dmd ALL producers/djs and DJs but got only a reply from Pegassi, that was pretty nice but tbh not so helpful. I tried everything to find better contact information but most of them are just booking emails and management. When they see a demo it gets deleted instantly… Does anyone have some contacts(emails,numbers) to industry professionals? How can I get them with no name in the scene nor connections? Is there a way of paying for it? Some help would really be amazing and would get me out of this dead end!❤️",

    "title": "Predictions for the state of EDM in 2026",
    "content": "I’m curious as to everyone’s predictions as to what’s gonna be popular / the trends in EDM in 2026! Here are some my predictions at random, kind of America centric but some worldwide:\n\n- Dabin style, guitar laden, anime inspired, melodic bass will become the standard for melodic bass, he will start releasing remixes for big kpop artists that are uploaded to spotify \n\n- isoXO continues his take over of the trap scene, trap will basically revolve around a mix of isoXO and Juelz-style sounds, trap might dig more into sounds that have 90s house/eurodance vibes (like ISOKNOCK -4ever)\n\n- sustain basses will finally start to lose their chokehold on modern dubstep, slightly more intricate drum patterns will make their way into dubstep influenced by the rise of UKG \n\n- Yoi basses will make a come back at some point, as artists follow tape Bs lead and incorporate even more sounds from the early 2010s but with current production value\n\n- the return of griz brings a wave of more jazzy dubstep interest, replacing a little bit of the dominance of space bass sounds\n\n- melodic techno loses some steam as anyma and afterlife start to diversify their sounds a bit more, with anyma introducing more and more tech house, tale of us does not reunite in any serious form, melodic techno artists start to lean more techno-y\n\n- argy starts to play more psytrance-y stuff in his sets \n\n- Calvin Harris releases a compilation album of his eurodance themed hits possibly with a reference to the word eurodance\n\n- the Marlon hoffstadt / malugi style of 90s trance mixed with techno catches full steam, dragging a hard house revival with it (eg luvstruck, dj heartstring)\n\n- kettama and mall grab push hardgroove more mainstream, with more techno artists using the “skipping” hardgroove drum patterns but making the sounds more palatable to a wider EDM audience \n\n- UKG and speed garage become near as popular as house music, Sammy virji gets closer to being top level EDM recognition, UKG becomes very commonly used to switch vibes from housey to bassy and bassy to housey\n\n- Lofi house becomes modern day poppy acid house - eg the rise of music that sounds like Real Lies, may channel a bit of the energy of 2010s Australian electro pop, will have a very British sound \n \n- the term “minimal” / “minimal house” becomes the defacto term for the combo of 90s deep house + 2000s rnb + electro that chris stussy and josh baker and rossi are making popular\n\n- in ibiza and UK minimal house style sounds becomes synonymous with house music; in the US, max dean / luke dean starts selling out 3000 person venues, minimal house artists become representative to more mainstream EDM audiences as the “sound of house music”\n\n- breakbeats starts to emerge from the underground, an anjunadeep artist may promote more melodic breaks, someone from the Spanish breakbeats scene - either yo speed or bowser starts getting regular play in both UKG sets, as well as a vibe switch in dubstep or minimal house or dnb sets \n\n- dnb continues to get more popular in the US and at least one relatively big US artist, incorporate drum &amp; bass into an album, likely a female pop artist\n\n- riddim maintains its popularity, it doesn’t get much more popular than it is now it is more likely on average to have a waning interest, as more UKG and breakbeats influenced style dubstep catches steam\n\n- Fred again / Barry can’t swim / swimming Paul style EDM starts to get incorporated into the soundtracks to movies and, and more mainstream audiences start to mentally associate EDM with this sound when the word EDM comes to mind\n\n- Latin tech house will start to lose popularity in favor of minimal house, and big Latin tech house artists will start including more Afro house as well as house music inspired by the Middle East\n\n- EDM artists powered by the Saudi regime might catch waves inorganically, but the desire for “authentic” middle eastern sounds and atmospheres in EDM will catch on\n\n- hard techno becomes a regular part of most heavy dubstep sets, at least 1 or 2 songs; a horror movie uses hard techno in a scene sound tracking some act of youthful revelation \n\n- American edm artists collabing with Bollywood will become more common, and there may be one or two remixes of Indian songs that get regular mid tier play in some western parts of the world\n\n- melodic house gets even bigger, This Never Happened gets some serious pop artists to make songs with big artists\n\n- Wave / hardwave catches some steam, one of these artists starts to be an undercard at more major festivals, likely one that is more trappy\n\n- interest in speed house starts to slow down and get replaced by more speed garage\n\n- more RnB artists infuse trip hop into their beats like “Chris brown - Holy Blindfold” \n\n- koastle leads the pack in some interest in future bass revival \n\n- chainsmokers release a minimal house song",

The idea: pair emerging tracks directly next to canon cuts so the algo learns the connection over time.\n\nCurrent snapshot (9 tracks):\n• Da Hool – Meet Her at the Love Parade\n• PolarzMuzik – Everything Is Clear\n• Above &amp; Beyond ft. Zoë Johnston – Sun &amp; Moon / Right at Dawn (Album Mix)\n• PolarzMuzik – TechKnee (Club Mix)\n• Chris Lake – Savannah\n• Tørstein – Cosmos of Chaos\n• Daft Punk – Derezzed (Tron Legacy)\n• Lottesque – Next!\n• Don Omar, Lucenzo &amp; Tiësto – Danza Kuduro (Tiësto Mix)\n\nListen / follow: &lt;paste your Spotify playlist link here&gt;\n\nI’m curating slowly and intentionally (EDM only). If you’ve got non-vocal or vocal-adjacent tracks that genuinely fit this flow, drop a link and a one-line “sounds like X-era &lt;artist&gt;” note. If it clicks, I’ll add it in the next rotation.",

VIP seems super expensive for some reason. I love the line up: Sara Landry, Grizz, Subtronics, Level Up, Green Velvet, Chase and Status, Knock2, Tape B, Zedd, Max Styler, Medvza\n\nFor CO, it sounds more stable and solid, but saw reports of someone spiking the water, it being way too packed etc. Line up is good but not as great: pretty much a subset of those listed above plus illeniumb2b excision. \n\nI also saw Countdown NYE in Cali, but just one day and line up excites me less. \n\nCan’t make a Halloween festival work \n\nAny recommendations? I’m just trying to get dabbed tf out at a fire EDM festival (or maybe a couple shows in one city) before year end and not get tramped lol happened to me once - never again! Prosper in San Diego also sounds nightmarish.",

But I don’t know where to start. I am hoping there is someone here who can offer advice on buying the best cameras considering the constraints of not having Media/Press passes to bring in a heavy duty camera.\n\nWhat works best with the festival lighting at night? Whats an ideal capture rate a camera should have for still photography? Is the Osmo Pocket good? Are there better Cameras that do both photo and video? I feel like there are so many questions that become a factor when thinking about purchasing a camera especially when i have a very specific goal in mind. I have a somewhat decent budget as i do not want to go dirt cheap, but also do not want to go overboard on spending.\n\nI would love some advice on getting started. I am not expecting to make money from this, but want to try something new and see where it takes me. Whether it leads to a future career change or a hobby on the weekends, I am simply following a passion and seeing where it goes!\n\nThank you for any advice in advance! 😁",

Some of my favorite artists are wonky wubby djs like Dirt Monkey, Rusko and Ahee who commonly throw dnb in their sets and I love it! I also saw hedex and loved that set! At Lost Lands, I saw Liquid Smoke (Smoaklands new liquid dnb set) and that was a vibe too! \n\nThen last night I went to DNB night in Boston and had a blast! This confirmed how much I love dnb and now I want to dive right in to it! \n\nSo I need recommendations for DNB djs to check out (somewhat based on the artists I already like but I'm open to giving any djs a chance)!!",

    "content": "The Minneapolis Sound, known for the most clean production of New Wave throughout the 1980s, have basically overtaken Detroit as the leading sonic source of inspiration in EDM within the span about a generation. A lot cleaner production values throughout the scene, even in supposedly harsher genres. When and why did that happen?\n\nFor example, the signature muddy organic “Reese” bass have mostly been replaced by clean bass supersaws (reminiscent of the intro to “Jump” by Van Halen or most of Dutch Trance) in DnB that ends up sounding both bloated and thin under a raw soul/rnb sample as far as Liquid Funk is concerned. The only instruments you can add on to that bass is Avicii style pianos and other supersaws. \n\nSynthwave, which is heavily inspired by the Minneapolis Sound, is all over drum production. A gated reverb fest for everyone and anyone and a lot of novelty sound effects reminiscent of Art of Noise to spice things up.\n\nEven the more sophisticated corners of EDM takes cues from the more “Quiet Storm” side of Minneapolis, mostly within the Deep House, Liquid DnB and Vaporwave scenes. \n\nHow and why did this transition happen? And how should Minneapolis capitalize on this? Are there any great EDM festivals in the Twin Cities?",

And, I really enjoy these types of music, but something that bugs me is how people DJ it. Techno is awesome. Techno DJs are awesome. I love how they like, evolve and slowly create something that's awesome. But for hard techno, they play like 16 beats or 32 beats, then go to the next song, then go to the next song, then they try to play banger after banger after banger, and it doesn't work because I can't get my groove in. Whenever I DJ, I try to play at least 64 or 128 beats while slowly combining ambiences and kicks, and it works really well, and it's really fun to just listen to over a long time. Like, why do most mainstream hard techno DJs not do that? I genuinely don't understand.",

He never really got big enough for there to be much information out there on him and his social media has been pretty much inactive for over a decade. It seems weird to me that he made a couple songs that started to get popular then just completely fell off",

The song is being played life through speakers in a facility and it seems like AI/software can't pick up the track. \nSince the video is from 2009 it's most likely an older track, feels like something from the 80s to late 90s/early 2000. Words sung there are also not quite discernible so trying to find the song by typing any lyrics didn't yield any successful results. \n\nDoes anyone here know that song? :-)\nKind regards \n\n\nEdit on October 28th, 2025: \nAfter some research I'm pretty sure that the above linked song samples Bonnie Taylor - Holding out for a hero. Specifically the dance version, 5:10 in this video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=my50a8dDHWY\n\nGetting close but it's still not the one in the opening post. The one version in the opening post seems to be a male alto remake with soft and mellow strummed guitar chords in the refrain. Couldn't find a proper match so far though",

Almost all styles are represented, sub-genres mainstages, peak time techno, hard techno, hardstyle, hardcore, melodic techno, drum &amp; bass, melodic house, tech house, afro house, and even dubstep. The only genre that is not represented enough in my humble opinion is trance.\n\nUltra &amp; EDC Las Vegas also have diverse musical genres represented.\n\nAny other EDM festivals that have th greatest diversity of EDM genres",

Lots of new edits and mixes that are great.\n\nWhere I will agree is that he doesn’t cater to clubs or the festival circuit first, but this can be said about other artists like Porter Robinson, Madeon, etc.",

    "title": "PAN Croatia 2026 — Island Takeover in the Adriatic",
    "content": "Hey r/EDM fam 👋\n\nI have posted here a couple of times before about this project, and I want to acknowledge that upfront. I have been a longtime lurker on Reddit, quietly following this community for years, and I am finally finding my voice. Your feedback genuinely means a lot to me. I am trying to share this in a way that feels respectful and authentic, not promotional.\n\nPAN Croatia 2026 is something I have been building with a small team of friends. It is a weeklong electronic music gathering on Obonjan Island, a private island off the coast of Šibenik, Croatia, from May 19 to 25, 2026.\n\nIt sits somewhere between a boutique festival and a community retreat. There will be sunrise to sunset programming, natural stages by the sea, and shared spaces designed for people who care about art, music, and deeper connection.\n\nPhase 1 of the lineup includes Dee Montero, Double Touch, Eelke Kleijn, Jan Blomqvist, and Layla Benitez. Phase 2 has been finalized and will be announced once the early bird tickets close, with two more phases currently in the works. The island will host around 850 guests, staying in island homes, glamping lodges, and glamping tents.\n\nYour stay includes private round trip transfers between the airport and the island, as well as breakfast, lunch, and dinner each day, all included in the ticket. Everything is designed so that guests can arrive, settle in, and focus entirely on the experience and the community.\n\nThis is the first public event being piloted by Project Sanctuary, a members based community that usually hosts smaller gatherings in Bali, France, and all over the world. It brings together an eclectic mix of artists, change makers, and visionaries who are shaping culture and creating positive impact globally.\n\nThere will be no phones or cameras allowed on the dance floor. We want to bring it back to the way it used to be, where the focus is on presence, connection, and shared experience rather than social media. This is about living in the moment, not about posting performatively for everyone to see.\n\nIf you have ever been to Obonjan or love smaller, more intentional festivals, I would really love to hear your thoughts.\n\nCapacity limited to only 850 people.\n\n🌐 Tickets and info [https://www.ticketfairy.com/r/45342/2075478](https://www.ticketfairy.com/r/45342/2075478)\n\n🗣️ Community &amp; updates r/PANCroatia2026\n\n📸 Peek into the community [https://community.projectsanctuary.club/](https://community.projectsanctuary.club/) (password: communityiseverything)\n\nFor anyone curious to join early, there is an epic pioneer early bird rate available with promo code THANKYOU at checkout for the first 100 tickets. Grab them while you can. I am really thankful and honored for the people who have already dove in headfirst and secured their spots. 🌅\n\nWe love you all. See you on the island!",

    "content": "I’ve been following Peggy Gou for a while — mostly out of curiosity, not fandom — and it feels like her public persona has shifted almost entirely into fashion/luxury influencer territory. Every post is a Balenciaga outfit, a Dior event, or some “effortlessly cool” airport shot with designer luggage. Meanwhile, her music output feels… thin? Same glossy retro house formula, no real evolution, and it’s hard to tell if she’s even that interested in DJing anymore.\n\nEven beyond that, I can’t imagine this life ever giving anyone any level of happiness or contentment. It seems so hollow and lacking any flavor. She seems to have the look of a tranquilized horse, devoid of any emotion. I feel like if I had that lifestyle that’s how I’d feel after a while. She seems deeply unhappy.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, she’s clearly worked hard to build her brand and has an eye for aesthetics — but lately it feels more like she’s performing the idea of a cool DJ than actually being one. Like her whole career has turned into this Instagram loop of designer shopping, photo ops, and half-baked singles that exist mainly to feed the aesthetic.",

    "content": "I’ve been re-watching a lot of 2019 sets from EDCLV and notice how some artists performing at the Cosmic meadow stage have more vfx/pyro/lighting than other artists, And I’ve noticed similar at UMF and even Escape Halloween too, this is more so an open discussion but does the artist pay out of pocket for any of it, does the festival cover it with the $ from tickets or how does all that work?",

    "content": "I was lucky enough to travel to Red Rocks to see the debut of Madeon’s new live show. I am convinced this will be one of the biggest tours of 2026. I saw it over  a week ago and am still buzzing from it. \n\nMadeon has raised the bar for himself and the scene with his new live show titled *Victory*. And indeed victory it is for the teen prodigy now in his early 30s. While his new single Hi! seemed to suggest a departure from EDM, I am pleased to report that there is far more continuity with his catalog than departure. \n\nAdventure had an air of youthful wistfulness about the innocence of teenage love. Good Faith had the dreamy sound scape and the fantasy inspired technicolor wonderland. Victory is loud, brash, and unapologetic production bordering on rock opera exploring Madeon’s relationship with fame.\n\nThe first single Hi! was a loving tribute to the indie sleaze sound of the early 2000s. Of the five songs formally debuted at Red Rocks suggest an album that draws influence from various rock genres. Yet the DNA of the tracks are still solidly EDM but with a palette of guitar riffs.\n\nVictory takes Madeon’s previous live show Good Faith Forever and puts all the production on steroids. The music is a beautifully interwoven mix that draws on his previous two albums as much as the new one. Every familiar song played was newly reimagined to fit into the sound of the new era. If you loved the visuals of Good Faith then you’ll love the new visuals by the same team.The lighting in particular was a fantastic upgraded to amazing effect. While won’t into specific tour spoilers of the plot of Victory needless to say his famous illusions are also put on steroids and there’s one particular moment everyone will be talking about. \n\nWith Victory, Madeon has entered the top tier of EDM productions up there with Justice, Odesza, Deadmau5’s Cube, Gareth Emery's LSR/City, or Prydz's Holo show. The crazy thing is that he seems to be doing it with half the budget of those other shows. If Prydz's Holo show or  Odesza’s shows are big Hollywood blockbusters than Madeon’s Victory is the A24 art house film equivalent.\n\n\nI know I am about a week late to the discussion but had to share how epic this show was. \n\nWas anyone else there?  What did you think?",

Not be that person, thats like \"it was way better in my day\" but. Trap EDM was way better in 2012. I would like to know if I'm just old? or is trap edm wack now and not pushing the genre forward. I love other dubstep and grime,  sometimes I might get crazy to riddim (and I don't really like riddim, but I can understand the alure and to me the artists are pushing it forward). It just seems stale to me.",

She was transported to a cave filled with crystals. After going up the moving platform, she met a guy with a crystal fox/wolf mask with a floating convertible. The world she was very dream like and abstract. They drove through open sand fields to open oceans with mines near the surface. After thst, they been attack by a robot that looks like the one from the iron giant. They were heading to a city while meteors were raining down. Some were close to hiting them but the girl woke up before it happened.

It came out around that era 2012-2014 ish. \n\nI can’t hum it for you but the drop shout before it kicked in was “Why am I doing this?” But it was more spoken word and kind of monotone. It also paused on the ‘why’ a little bit. More like “Why, am I doing this?” In a monotone spoken word voice.\n\nI realise if it was a sample pack drop shout it could be any track. But I think it was fairly popular. \n\nAlso, if memory serves me correctly, the synth in the drop was a square wave sounding synth. It also played only 4 notes over and over in a very syncopated rhythm. \n\nThis could be any track I know, but if you know any that sound remotely like this I’d like to hear",

    "title": "From Trance to Techno; how substances shape a scene",
    "content": "Disclosure up front: US citizen (sorry), I know that other regions differ vastly, just wanted to tune in.  \n\nIt’s no secret; ketamine is everywhere.  At least, here in the states.  And it makes sense; it’s easy, quick, and discreet.  But the way in which it alters perception channels is largely, in my belief, the reason as to why techno and other bass-led groove genres have become so prevalent.  \n\nWithout getting too deep into the neuro weeds, K favors bottom up perceptive tuning, which is what we “feel”.  But since it’s a dissociative, the feel goes from “here” to “there”, and so the color of feel is dulled, and what’s left is a very hefty amount of what literal “feel”, as music, is.  That’s the baseline groove.  That’s why K and techno are a match made in heaven.  \n\nBut when perception is no longer “here”, narrative and storytelling lose meaning.  And music, that once was a reminder that you are always home, becomes something to just feel good.  We could spend time on MDMA, but truthfully, when looking at the rise of trance of old, we can turn to LSD (and the other psychs).  \n\nPsychedelics are unique in how they alter perception; that is to say, it does not simply “alter”, but widens.  Thought and emotion color each other.  Shrooms are bottom up in a similar fashion to K, but because they don’t dissociate (I’m greatly oversimplifying forgive me lol), you feel music as it guides your emotions, as thoughts seem to time perfectly alongside.  LSD widens perception in a top down narrative that allows you to view all as is.  Music becomes much more detailed, and structure appreciated in design.  In much the same way that the self can be identified in this state as construct, so too are the motifs and narrative elements that lay littered throughout the storytelling in a Trance or Prog mix.  \n\nAnd that’s what makes something like LSD so deeply connected these genres.  They live and breath in the mids.  Arps, pads and vocals galore, all asking to be perceived.  And so widened perception sticks like glue.  The origins of Goa, into what became psy.  And prog house as well.  They’re long form art, not song.  The payoff is in the hours of listening, not tuning in and out whenever.  \n\nI’m not asking yall to lend me an Arp or 303, but it is something that’s very interesting to me.  Story beyond the self; one of a shared unity, of every individual, much the same in the origin of their own worlds perceived.  A lot of the main floor Trance now is seeming to trend towards bass-led grooves too, so just checking in I guess. Would love to chat or share in regard to local scenes if yall have noticed anything in particular.  Thanks!\n\nAcknowledging bias: 4 tabs dissolve listening to Northern Exposure, but I swear I swear that I love techno too man but I just miss the feel beyond the feel in the day to day scene (hard to get proggy in NorCal) at least aite thanks for listening to my ramblings 👽🌌",

At lost lands last year a very special jersey of mine with over 36 (now 90+) signatures went missing Friday night. On Saturday I was one of the first few people to be waiting for his meet up, I told him about my missing jersey and asked for him to sign it if it’s ever returned. I eventually got the jersey back and reached out to him in December. He said near the end of the month he’d be able to let me mail it out. \nBut as we know quickly after that things went south for him. I planned on seeing him at the end of December and then at Voydome, but life had other plans. \nI’ve since reached out to any artist that has worked with him in the past. No one’s been able to help, and I have no way of reaching him anymore. \nIf anybody can help, please no trolls or negativity, only am asking for a true helping hand and just this opportunity to complete my quest. \nIf you’ve read all this then you deserve a hug or pat on the back, thank you and have a great week! \nIf anyone can help me out btw, I will make it worth your time and make sure you know how grateful I am! \nHe’s still my king and this year without him has been so tough. I miss my death pits and wall of deaths! \n\nI know I’ll probably get some push back from this post, but in truth I don’t care if I get hate, all I’m asking is for a helping hand and this opportunity.",

GTFO. \n\nI could provide like 20 more examples of these shitty songs. Be gone. That's all. Just one person's opinion. Anyone feel like this?

    "content": "Was going through my playlist and realised that the older festival prog house songs from 2012-14 had a different sound from the newer ones today, as in they sounded more 'anthemic' and had longer breakdowns? (compared to a modern Martin Garrix track with poppy vocals + violin-lish drops)\n\n  \nSome examples here:\n\n\\- [Beating Of My Heart (Matisse &amp; Sadko Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV9S1tmkQEs)\n\n\\- [The Naked And Famous - Young Blood (Tiësto &amp; Hardwell Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOiEAXh6xjA)\n\n\\- [Tom Swoon &amp; Stadiumx ft. Rico &amp; Miella - Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yhE5DKqPHo)\n\n\\- [Stereotronique &amp; Sebastian Ivarsson - Tonight (feat. Danyka Nadeau)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=299MQTPp_KM)\n\n  \nJust wondering if there are any newer artists who are still making prog house similar to this style? These tracks were what got me into the genre initially so I count them as my personal Golden Era.",

I turned my old walking friends to EDM on our walks and they seem to enjoy the walking beats. I’m nearly 70 years old so I kind of stick out at events. I’d like to check out local DJs at clubs around the Detroit area but I can’t dance anymore let alone stand for hours. Are there any venues with seating?",
