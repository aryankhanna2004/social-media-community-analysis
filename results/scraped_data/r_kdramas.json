    "content": "Ji Chang Wook… honestly, I don’t even know where to start. There’s just something about him that goes beyond looks, fame, or popularity it’s the way he *feels* every role, the way he brings life into every character he plays. Watching him act feels like watching someone pour his heart out without holding anything back. Whether it’s *Healer*, *Suspicious Partner*, *The K2*, or *The Worst of Evil*, every time he steps on screen, it’s like he’s living that life, not just acting it.\n\nI still remember how in *Healer*, he was this mysterious yet soft-hearted man who carried both pain and warmth in his eyes. In *Suspicious Partner*, he made us fall for his mix of seriousness and charm those small expressions, the way he looked at her, it all felt so real. Then *The K2 t*hat raw intensity, the brokenness he showed without even saying much… that’s the kind of acting that leaves you breathless. And in *The Worst of Evil*, he just went beyond everything the emotions, the inner conflict, the darkness he played it all like he was born for it.\n\nBut it’s not just about his acting. It’s the way he carries himself in real life humble, gentle, and kind despite all the fame. He never tries to show off. He stays grounded, smiles softly, treats people with genuine respect, and that makes him even more admirable. You can tell he’s someone with a pure heart hardworking, passionate, and sincere in everything he does,...........",

    "title": "I just love Han Sohee SO FREAKING MUCH",
    "content": "She just finished her last fan meeting. I was supposed to meet her, but it unfortunately got cancelled, and it still pains me 💔She is beautiful and talented, and I fell in love with her after watching My Name. And yes, I GET IT, A lot of people are saying things like, did you see how she handled that scandal with Hyeri? She is obviously a homewrecker, obviously a mean girl, not a girls’ girl 🙄 I hear the hate, but what really irritates me is when people say she isn’t even pretty, that she is a terrible actress, and basically give off the feeling that she is somehow wrong for existing. That’s disappointing. Yes, I know she didn’t handle the situation perfectly. But I understand her. She was feeling so much anxiety and stress being blamed for something that wasn’t even true. Everyone jumped on the hate train, acting like she wasn’t even human. That breaks my heart 💔\n\nToday, at her last fan meeting, people finally got to see how easy going and chill she really is. For those who know Sohee, she is someone who doesn’t hold grudges. I’m just happy that everyone who came got to see that side of her💖I remember reading a message she wrote to a fan last year, “Even if I resented the world, I have never resented people.” I’ve thought about that so much since then. I hope I can be like her. I think she felt the same during the scandal. She probably had nothing against Hyeri or Ryu Junyeol, she was just frustrated with the situation itself and felt she had to speak up even if it was not the right thing to do \n\nOne thing she also said that really sticks with me is that she said, “Because my parents and the grandmother who raised me are people who gave me life and made me grow up looking at this world. And then, by doing this work, I came to have you all. In making my life, my birth and death, that may not even be 100 years, into a comedy rather than a tragedy, I am so thankful to you.” She didn’t grow up with parental love and was raised by her grandmother, and look how far she has come 🥺🥹Rather than focusing on her achievements, all people care about are untrue rumours. So WHEN do we hear that she told fans not to be skinny like her, that she is kindhearted and accepts every gift, or that she comforted Kim Saeron’s aunt at the funeral?\n\nEven though I try not to be parasocial because I don’t know her personally, and I can see that she didn’t handle the situation in the best way. But I want to support her just like every other Korean actress: it’s so hard to be a Korean girl celebrity. One mistake and you get dragged through the mud while Korean male actors get away with everything. So I will give her all my support ♥️💖I am also a Hyeri fan, and I hope they are not on bad terms anymore. I wish that scandal never happened because Sohee should thrive again.\n\nI CANNOT WAIT to see her in Project Y, The Intern, and Solo Leveling. OH AND I finished the webtoon Trash Belongs in the Trash Can, and she would be PERFECT as Yun Suji. I really hope Ji Changwook plays Woobin alongside her Woobin. I also want to see her in a dark Kdrama with Song Hye kyo or in a sad slice-of-life movie. Above all, I hope she knows that after her fan meeting, she still has a strong, supportive fanbase who loves her 💖😘🥰",

We can’t blame the guy if he’s always being offered with uber rich lead roles because he is definitely made for that character. But I think LMH is a very capable actor with a very expressive set of eyes. You can easily pin point the feelings he is trying to convey through his deep set of eyes and I think that is something that is lacking nowadays among the new actors of this era. Anyway, I would love to see him to star in another show as big as Pachinko, or as grand as Kim Eun Sook’s Mr. Sunshine, meaning, more of historical roles and outside of his comfort zone which is romantic male character. I want him to star in another historical action drama which will make his haters eat their words. I am waiting.",

We’re never truly invested in the people on screen their pain, their purpose, or the weight of their powers. \n\nIn Constantine, Mammon’s motive gave weight to the story, Demon Hunters lacks that depth, leaving its mythology hollow.\n\nWhat’s most frustrating is the lack of a real villain not even a shadow or whisper to spark curiosity. it missed its chance to leave us wanting more.\n\nAnd Seohyun  stunning, magnetic, but wasted. While Ma dong seok's all action, no heartbeat. With better writing, Both could’ve been the film’s soul.\n\nDemon Hunters teases greatness  a haunting world of faith, fire, and fate but its beauty feels borrowed.

I remember seeing clips online somewhere about a kdrama that's either out or going to come out about an older, slightly scruffy woman who switches bodies/minds with her younger kpop idol-self. I remember seeing one scene posted where the older woman who has her younger version's mind goes to talk to her friend from her idol days who is shocked and doesn't believe it is her at first, if that helps for context at all... Please let me know if you know what i'm referring to or if there is a similar drama that I may be thinking of or might enjoy. Hopefully I got the plot right. ",

    "title": "K-Drama review: Light Shop💡💡💡💡",
    "content": "I watched the first 3 episodes of this show months ago, but I got rid of Disney and never finished it. So when picking it back up last night, I just restarted the show.\n\nFirst off. The cinematography in this show is one of the best I’ve seen in a K-Drama. Each shot evokes the feeling that the director intends. The coldness of the outdoors, the darkness and the rain, then the warm colours with the Light Shop, the light in all that darkness, is a shop filled with lights. A beacon of sorts for the wandering spirits to find what they ever so need.\n\nThe cast is superb, all-star actors all around. No one really stands out specifically because everyone does. I’m interested in every character and where they’re gonna go throughout the story. Park Bo Young is here showing again that she is excellent. I don’t think she’s had a single mediocre show this decade, her script choices have been excellent. I wasn’t too big on DAYS, but I can’t deny it’s a good show. Ju Ji-hoon is this quiet but strangely comforting light keeper. He seems to be at the centre of the story.\n\nThe story is slow; it takes its time in the beginning to develop. The writing is excellent in that manner. The intrigue is at an all-time high in the first 4 episodes. You can follow along easily, but there is also this bigger narrative being mostly withheld from the viewer. It isn’t a mystery where there’s twist after twist. Or the stuff like “you thought you knew, but oh, this happened too!, and this!”. It’s delicately crafted, knowing what to reveal and what to withhold. The world-building is excellent. Reminds me of moving in that sense. In episode 4, a big thing is revealed. We know that something is going on, and we’re given clues, but my god, that final scene where the nurse is walking and we see the people in the ICU, it all clicks. The next episodes are essential backstory that makes the first 4 episodes much clearer. It’s devastating too, you look back and see that the little things that happened and seemed insignificant, were in fact really important. It was the little things in this show that really worked for me.\n\nKwon Yeong Ji (Park Bo Young) is probably the most mysterious character next to the light shopkeeper. Whilst she has a lot of screen time, and we know &gt;!she spent time in the afterlife, it isn’t shown. I thought it was refreshing that the two main characters never once shared a scene. But still felt so connected. That's how all these characters felt, really.!&lt;\n\nLee Ji Yeong (Kim Seol Yeong) and Kim Hyeong Min (Uhm Tae Goo) were probably the most devastating characters. At the beginning, you are made to believe she’s &gt;!evil, but once you’re given her backstory. You find she’s just trying to keep him alive. I struggled to watch her backstory in particular. I hope the worst for Ji Yeong’s mother (in the show). It was also sad how Ji Yeong didn’t remember her at the end, and she haunts him as an evil spirit (I believe).!&lt;\n\nI liked the detective; I just thought he didn’t have as big a role as the rest. I liked his ending, a spin-off detective horror would be great with him as the lead.\n\n&gt;!The light shopkeeper, finding out his daughter was Hyeong Ju’s mother, was the scene that finally got me teary. He became the keeper, and over 40 years later, he finally reunites with his daughter. I liked how they got their happy ending. Hyeong Ju was one of my favourite characters. The fact that she chose to remember everything was nice. It’s painful, but she has those final memories of her Mother and those she met!&lt;\n\nYun Seon Hae and Park Hye Won lived in a world that didn’t deserve them. I’m most pleased that they got their happy ending. \n\nThe tie-in at the end to &gt;!Moving was neat. Two brilliant shows that share the same universe. I actually preferred this show to Moving, which might be a controversial take. I loved the 8-episode format. I think the show wouldn’t have worked as well if it were any longer.!&lt;\n\nThe fact that this show led me to believe it was going to be a straight up horror mystery, and then ended up tearing my heart out emotionally, was a great and unexpected twist. The “evil ghosts” were just wandering spirits. Trying to find and protect those they cared about. Even the stoic light shopkeeper was revealed to be a &gt;!father who took on this role in hopes of reuniting with his child. This show is filled with sacrifice.!&lt; It’s heavy, it may be slow, and I guarantee this won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. But I loved every second of this show. It may have taken over Happiness as my favourite K-Drama of all time. I’m not sure yet. Maybe they’ll be tied.\n\n10/10.",

They might be childhood friends (not sure on that part)… and reconnect after a while.  \n\nI just remember one scene where both the leads are in a hospital.  She remembers all the times he asks her if she was okay (gwenchana?) and she had lately been very rude to him. In this particular scene she says -gajima(don’t go/don’t leave me) to him, though it was very hard to say.  I make it sound lame but It’s all quite dramatic -  kdrama style.  I loved that scene and the show but can’t remember what it is now.  It might have been Welcome to Samdal-ri or Our Beloved Summer but I feel like it is something else.  \n\nDo you know what it might be? Is there a ‘gajima’ scene that is your favorite?\n\n",

    "content": "I loved Our Unwritten Seouls so much I have to make a post.\n\n(spoiler) in everythingg written here \n\nIt’s sooo goooddd. I liked how they don’t always succeed at first, I like how realistic it is.  \n\nHow Miji was an up and coming successful runner but tripped and got a fracture and suddenly lost all that potential. \n\nI liked her dialogue especially in episode 4 how she was scared of being nothing again if she goes out. That she knows logically that it’s wrong to stay inside, that something may be wrong with her she said, how she just can’t, how opening the door and stepping out even took her four hours.\n\nI liked how she stayed locked up in her room for three years because of depression and how her grandmother handled her. How unconditional her grandma’s love is for her and how validating everything she said was🥹.  That even if she becomes nothing, like if she stays as she is, her grandmother still loves her.\n\nI liked how Miji when she finally knew what she wanted to do with her life she chose to go to college and had to take the CSAT three times and yet was able to get up and try again. \n\nI felt like something in me healed in episode 11 when mi rae told her mother she quit work and how she was sorry for keeping on disappointing her mom and how her mom told her she wasn’t disappointed in her, also how sejin’s grandfather answered him when he was sorry for only coming back with less than what was expected even though he was put in the states to study. \n\nI liked the scene where hosu felt like an obligation and a burden but her mother and him finally talked. \n\nI liked the ending, how sang wol started studying reading despite it seeming useless she thought since she had dyslexia but still she did learn, hosu on sign language, and mirae doing what she wants to do. \n\nI liked how miji told her school mate that “we always move forward, never backwards” that even if we feel like we went backwards, we didn’t, we always learned something.\n\nI don’t know, it feels like I’m harsh for saying I enjoyed those scenes, it’s not that I’m happy to see them suffer, It’s just that, it’s more relatable. As someone who used to be an achiever and now failed a school year, becoming someone who felt those, feeling like a disappointment to my family, and how my worth seemed to feel like it’s tied to my achievement before, and how there was a time where I only went to class simply just to show up but never studied that well at home and just locked myself in my room crying for months because of a breakup, feeling like I’m accepted and loved despite of that phase and that I can still move forward, and still write my own story like they did, that “yesterday is over, tomorrow is yet to come, and today is yet unknown” \n\nI also liked how mirae was so affected by how everyone saw her, how the rumors affected her. I care what people think and it sucks. How sejin says what they say isn’t real but those strawberries are.\n\nI know the flow of my writing isn’t that well but I just wanted to let out how much I loved the show. I think everyone should watch it. Especially those who are living pressured by people’s expectations. ",

Doing the most horrific things, often pushing the mc to contemplate taking their own life. inflicting serious physical harm for the sake of their own pleasure, sometimes sexual assault toward the women characters,and not to mental the psychological daily torment these characters have to endure.\n\nIt dose make for good tv but watching it sometimes I have to pause bc it’s genuinely so disturbing, and nobody helps the mc and when they do reach out for help they are dismissed. \n\nSorry ik this is a poorly written post the point still stands. I just wanna know everyone else’s thoughts on the topic. I love Kdramas but these bully’s are genuinely so disturbing, sadistic, psychopaths. ",

Seul Ki is playing a doctor so she starts helping the lady right away. She was wearing normal sports clothes and nothing was wrong with it.\n\nThen two guys come there and start filming her chest while she is trying to save the woman.Instead of confronting those guys ***Bae Na Ra comes and puts a jacket on her and tells her to cover herself***.That really made me mad...It was not her fault at all.She was just doing her job. The problem was with those men who were behaving in a disgusting way.But the scene made it look like she did something wrong just because of her clothes...\n\nThis is such a patriarchal way of thinking.writer/director showed it like the girl was at fault instead of showing the boys being confronted.It puts the blame on the woman and her clothes which is so wrong.\n\nAs a 23M, I feel ashamed seeing things like this. We should stop blaming women or their clothes for what men do.It is not about what she wears,it is about how people think.***This scene gave a very wrong message and I really wish writers stop showing things like this.***",

    "content": "Its a question i really wanted to ask! So basically, according to me:-\n\nYes… I still support him..... and I always will. People forget that behind the fame, the cameras, and the headlines, he’s still a human being someone who has endured heartbreak, scrutiny, and endless judgment from people who never truly knew his story. After the divorce, the world was quick to criticize him, to twist every word, every expression, every silence into something ugly. But even through all that chaos, he chose dignity over drama. He stayed silent, calm, and focused and that silence said everything about his strength.\n\nInstead of responding to the hate, he let his work speak for him. *“Arthdal Chronicles”* revealed his versatility; *“Vincenzo”* reminded everyone of his power and precision as an actor, cold on the outside, yet burning with emotion underneath. And when he returned with *“Reborn Rich”*, it was proof that no matter what storms he faced in his personal life, his artistry remained unshaken. Each project felt like a quiet statement: *“I’m still here. I’m still doing what I love.”*\n\nThat’s why I can’t stop supporting him. Because it’s not just about admiring his looks or fame it’s about respecting his resilience. He didn’t break under pressure, he didn’t let bitterness define him. Instead, he turned pain into purpose, and that takes a rare kind of courage.\n\nSo yes, I’ll always stand by him. Because being a true fan isn’t about celebrating only the sunny days it’s about believing in someone even when the world turns its back. And through every role, every performance, every quiet moment of strength, he’s reminded me why I admired him in the first place. He fell, but he rose and he’s shining brighter than ever.\n\nso... i will support him no matter what happens, no matter the whole world goes against it, and no matter what happens, i will support him and i will definitely do it.

    "content": "I finished watching Happiness yesterday and I really enjoyed it. \n\nWhile I'm not an expert on KDramas, I've only watched a couple, I think it might be my favourite. \n\nOne of the things I really liked was how focused the story was. Looking at when it was made, its possible Covid played a part in that. After the first 2 or 3 episodes it's all in one central location, everyone is part of the main storyline, and (mostly) everyone interacts with everyone else at some point. \n\nIt felt character driven too, rather than plot driven. Obviously its a somewhat high concept plot overall, but the disease ends up playing a background role a lot of the time, and the human stories are at the center of the story. Again, this is possibly a direct result of being written and filmed in Covid times. \n\nI also really enjoyed the love story between the leads. I love a swoony slow mo moment in the rain as much as anyone, but it felt like a much more realistic love story here. I believed that they were in love all along and their brains, or her brain in particular, just hadn't caught up to their hearts yet. It added a lot of depth to their journey and struggles with the other characters. So while it wasn't the main focus of the storyline, it still played a big part, but in a smart way. \n\nAfter finishing and looking up some of the cast I was saddened to learn that Na Chul passed away a few years ago. I loved his character, I thought it was a very well written arc, and I was genuinely considering getting an avocado tshirt and catchers mask for Halloween this year. \n\nSoundtrack was a banger too. I've been listening to Pain by Isaac Wong all morning. \n\nAnyway, I guess I just wanted to share my appreciation for the show, and if anyone can reccomend anything with a similar vibe. Character driven, well written, there can be romance but I also just appreciate any kind of interpersonal relationships that make you care for the characters, regardless of what the setting is. I also really liked the tight focus the show had, and it kept my attention all the time. There were no side plots or characters that I didn't care about. So anything that's got a relatively small cast, or links a bigger cast and plots together really well. \n\nThat's probably a lot of very specific requirements there, but sure throw out your thoughts and we'll see what happens.

    "title": "Watched \"Mr Queen\" for the first time - honest review. SPOILERS",
    "content": "In my opinion, Mr Queen was both pleasantly surprising and progressive in some ways yet ultimately was disappointing and reflective of conservative Korean social values.\n\nWhat worked: the acting was phenomenal. There was definitely chemistry between the leads and there were some great comedy moments.  \n\nWhat didnt work: there was a point where I found it annoying that the chef was acting in such hyper masculine gestures when he was the Queen. We saw him in the modern day, he wasnt super masculine.  At times if felt unrealistic that the chef would not adapt to mannerisms of a royal Queen, and stop using modern lingo.\n\nThe villains were ridiculously annoying.  The child hood friend turned into a villain cus...he shared one kiss with the queen when she was crying?  His villain arch didnt feel believable.  At times, his motivations didnt make sense.\n\nThe Queen getting pregnant after the first time they were intimate was ridiculous.  She wasn't even fully sober and thought she was being intimate with her palace maid.   Rather than lacking consent, I believe the real Queen likely just changed what he saw.  But then later when the a fake body is brought into the palace, pretending to be the King, the Queen seems to have realised it wasn't him by feeling his...private area. This makes no sense.\n\nThe ENDING! I really disliked it.  The chef being sent back to the present day, just when he was falling in love with the King felt like the writers chose to please conservative viewers rather than explore the idea that the chef had truly formed a sexual attraction to the King and might be bisexual or even gay. There were other times in the series where the chef queen said that they should be intimate so others don't question the child's paternity - this didnt end up happening.  There were several times where the chef Queen almost became intimate/kissed the King but something happened like pregnancy sickness, or falling asleep, etc.  The show seemed to try hard to limit the affection the viewers saw between chef queen and King. \n\nIn the end, it was clear there was love between chef Queen and the King.  Him being sent back to the present was the opposite of romantic - the King fell in love with the chef queen's personality and quirks, and didnt fall in love with the real Queen.  Also it's hypocritical of the writers to choose this outcome when the chef Queen criticised the villain love interest (Kim Byeong-in) for only liking the \"shell\" of her.  The show is setting the King up to be guilty of the same thing. \n\nTLDR: there were good moments but ultimately the show played it safe and limited any same sex romance involving a happy ending.  At best, it was intentionally catering to a conservative audience. At worse, it was perpetuating anti-gay ideology.",

If you're making the same observation as me, do you have any answers?\nI think the formats are no longer respected. We're seeing more and more series with 8 or 10 episodes, often with the intention of wanting a second season. Perhaps the streaming companies are partly responsible. Often the initial idea is good, but after a few episodes, the storyline collapses...\nBut perhaps also the audience's expectations are no longer the same. Most of the successful Kdramas this year had little or no love triangle. Maybe we're tired of seeing protagonists waver between two suitors. We're a little fed up with heroes who act like 14-year-olds when it comes to love...\n\nWhat do you think?",

I changed my profile language and suddenly, i kid you not, i found 20+ drama's i never had access to? \n\n\n\nWhat i assume happened: \nNot every kdrama has dutch subtitles available so even though i don't use dutch subtitles they don't show the kdrama to me because they directly assume i want to watch in dutch, thus they make everything that isn't available in dutch unavailable for me. \n\n\nBy changing the language of your profile (viewing language specifically!) You get access to the drama's that don't have translations yet. \n\n\nThis might not work for the bigger languages as i assume most kdrama's have hindi, spanish, french, german and chinese subtitles etc. \nBut it might help for the smaller countries/languages like mine!

Despite her hectic schedule as a top neurosurgeon, she knows how to balance work and personal life so well. She’s in her 40s, single, and yet genuinely content, also has Great friends and social circle.\n\nI love how she takes time for herself, especially her weekly camping trips. Just being in nature, away from work, doing something that’s purely for her — it’s so peaceful and grounding. Watching her made me realize I want that kind of balance too, to just enjoy quiet moments once in a while.\n\nAnother character I deeply admire is Yeorum from Summer Strike. She’s incredibly strong, Wish I had the courage to live like her. It takes guts to say “enough” to a toxic work life and just walk away. Even when her new life in a small town turns difficult, she doesn’t lose hope. She tries her best to adapt, accept, and find joy in the little things. And meeting people like Dae-bum, Bom, and her grandmother along the way just made her journey feel even more meaningful.\n\nWhich K-drama character’s lifestyle made you feel like that — like, “That’s the kind of life I want”?",

I watched romance is a bonus book and certain moments with the ML made me all weak in the knees, and I’m currently halfway through Doom at your service and though there haven’t been tons yet, some moments Doom just makes me swoon🫣\n\nI enjoy any genre (as long as it has romance) and watch any setting etc.  and I don’t mind waiting for the swoon either, like if the couple doesn’t get along at first, it’s fine as long as the ML steps up his game at some point 😆\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "content": "So, I'm 4 years late to the party, but I just finished watching Beyond Evil, and it was just incredible. The story was good, but what made it so gripping was definitely the cast. Shin Ha-Kyun absolutely blew my mind, and his chemistry with Yeo Jin-Goo was out of this world. I also developed a huge crush on Kim Shin-Rok.\n\nI've read that some people find it too slow, and while I get where they're coming from in terms of plot, I think the main focus of the drama is the relationships between the characters, even more so than the thriller/mystery aspect. In that regard, it reminded me of My Mister. Although it's a completely different genre, they're both dramas with a fairly slow-paced plot, but each episode in chock-full of character development and turning points in relationships.\n\nAnyway, I went in expecting a police investigation kind of drama, and instead I got my heart broken and put together again like 10 times, by these two emotionally fucked-up guys who can't stop staring longingly at each other while saying stuff like \"Are you okay? Not asking because I like you or anything\" (I'm paraphrasing).",

    "title": "Thoughts on Wang Wook from \"Moon Lovers\"",
    "content": "I find it surprising when people over romanticize Wang Wook when he is actually one of the most selfishly disguised characters in the entire drama. He was objectively a bad character and not just “a sad second lead\". Let's get into it! \n\n\n1. His “gentleness” was a mask\n\nFrom the start, Wook cultivated the image of a kind, noble, and considerate man but only when it cost him nothing. When real courage or moral action was required, he consistently chose safety, convenience, and self preservation over doing what was right.\n\n2. He emotionally betrayed his sick wife\n\nWhile his wife was bedridden and dying, Wook emotionally pursued Hae Soo.\nHe leaned on her for comfort, attention, and validation, fully aware of his marital obligations. This is emotional infidelity, pure and simple yet people romanticize it as “heartfelt longing.”\n\n3. He only wanted Hae Soo for himself, not her happiness\n\nWook’s love was conditional and self centered. He desired her only because she made him feel fulfilled or admired. He didn’t act for her well being, safety, or joy but only for the reward she brought him.\n\n4. He abandoned her when she needed protection\n\nAt critical moments, when Hae Soo was in danger or under attack, Wook remained silent. He didn’t defend her, didn’t confront threats because doing so would risk his comfort, position, or reputation. Now please don't say \"he turned her back on her and wanted to become the king only to properly pursue and protect her in the future\"\nThat excuse doesn’t hold. Wook’s actions actively hurt Soo and others, including ordering murders and poisoning. Claiming he “planned it to protect her later” ignores the real, immediate harm he caused and is just fan retcon.\n\n5. He personally orchestrated Crown Prince Moo’s death\n\nWook ordered Chae Ryung to poison Moo’s bath water with mercury. This was not a political accident or an indirect consequence of inaction, it was a deliberate, calculated act of murder to remove a rival. This single act alone shatters any illusion of him as a “noble second lead\". \n\n6. He caused Wang Eun’s death\n\nHe knew Wang Eun was vulnerable and that supporting him could be dangerous. Yet Wook chose political safety over family loyalty, effectively allowing Eun to die.\nAgain, he didn’t have to act heroically but he actively chose not to protect a brother for his own gain.\n\n7. He wanted love AND power, but not the sacrifice\n\nWook’s “love” for Hae Soo was never unconditional. He wanted her affection without accepting the costs of protecting her, standing for her, or risking anything for her. When she was endangered or when pursuing love conflicted with his ambitions, he retreated.\n\n8. He played the tragic victim while being the architect of tragedy\n\nAfter Hae Soo’s suffering, Wook acted “wounded” as if fate had cruelly punished him. In reality, he created much of her sufferings, emotionally, politically, and literally (through Moo’s murder). This hypocrisy makes him arguably more detestable than an overt villain, because he cloaked cruelty in a “gentlemanly” mask.\n\n9. Power corrupted him, but his love was never pure\n\nEven after losing Hae Soo, Wook pursued the throne with bitterness and resentment.\nHis “love” was never about her. It was about possession, recognition, and ego. A truly good character would have protected what she loved or acted in her interest. Wook acted only in his.\n\n10. He wanted admiration, not accountability\n\nAt the end of the day, Wook loved the idea of being good  but refused the burdens of being good.He wanted to be praised, pitied, and romanticized  yet he engineered betrayal, murder, and suffering while keeping his hands “clean” in appearance.\n\n\n\nSo basically, \nWang Wook is not tragic. He is selfish, cowardly, manipulative, and morally compromised, dressed in the facade of a noble gentleman. Romanticizing him ignores the fact that he caused deaths, cheated emotionally, abandoned love when it demanded courage, and only acted for himself. He is not the victim of circumstance , he is the author of his own moral failures.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on him?",

    "content": "Hello All,I could really use your help finding a 1 season Joseon era Romantic Comedy/Drama. It involves a prince who flees his assassins \n&amp; is attacked by a princess of another kingdom who he's pre-arranged to marry. Trying to flee on a boat, both the prince &amp; would be princess/assassin fall into the water &amp; suffer amnesia. They're rescued by members of a town that borders all of the neighboring Joseon kingdoms. The eccentric township is nominally ruled by the town courier clan. There's also a brothel, restaurant, &amp; gambling clans w/ ruling heads. Oh, &amp; the prince has a super heightened sense of smell due to an allergic bee sting he received on his nose as a kid. Hopefully, someone can help me out. Thank you! ",

But it's just creepy to see JCW with the 10-year-old version of FL, knowing the characters will one day get together.\n- **Behind Your Touch:** Park Sung Yun (the aunt) and Kim Hee Won (police chief) play their 20-something-year-old selves. I couldn't find the best picture to show how funny it is, but in episode 1 or 2, there's a scene where she's running towards him and she's visibly not in her 20s.\n- **Romance in the House:** this is the most unbelievable one for me, but I could not for the life of me find a picture of the parents in their flashback scenes. They're both in their early 50s and definitely don't pass for 20s. They just put a baseball cap on Kim Jee Soo and called it good. 😂",

    "content": "I'm currently on ep 5 and WOW. I kind of put it off a bit then I watched Trigger and became Kim Young Kwang obsessed so wanted to try it out. Long story short - no spoilers because this all happens in the first episode - average 40-something suburban mom with significant financial issues (not the least of a husband with aggressive cancer) inadvertently comes into a stash of potentially highly lucrative d\\*\\*gs, if she can figure out how to distribute them - which would help her financial situation. Enter Kim Young Kwang, a dealer with an agenda of his own. The growing chemistry, not \"necessarily\" romantic just a bit adversarial/fiery, is god-tier in my opinion. The yin-yang of the evolving partnership. Obviously there's much more underlying backstory, nuance for all characters, but it's a rollicking ride. I do think that Young Kwang's ability to shift from \"can destroy you with my pinky finger\" to adorable golden retriever if he just smiles, adds 1000% nuance to this role. Lee Young Ae, with whom, - despite 100s of dramas thus far - I am unfamiliar, is FANTASTIC as the desperate mom who is trying to save her husband and her daughter. Anyway. Signal boost for this one. I'm watching on Kocowa.",

The drama is just the quintessence of all the stupid things of kdramas with misunderstanding, falling in one another arms etc... They really abused this mechanic, and there are no other things ! When it happens just a few times in the 16 episodes I can bear it, and sometimes even find it cute but here... I don't have words. It's like hometown cha cha cha but worse, at least there was a story around the romance, a bit of \"deepness\" in the character. \n\nI'm in the middle of the 6th episode, does it get better ? \n\nThanks !

I remember continuously laughing at the humor woven into the plot and the interesting way the plot was written. I rewatched it after 4 years this week, and the plot and especially the humor STILL HITS! (it's somehow even better). Shin Hye Sun's voiceover and the intentions behind her actions only for it to be misunderstood by everyone especially the king (no touch - iykyk) just makes it such an enjoyable watch. She was the most perfect casting for her role as the queen, with her mannerisms, attempts to impress the ladies around her and especially the way she lived through the role with the perfect body language and dialogue delivery. It's most definitely worth the rewatch (minus the ending ofc)",

    "content": "I'm going to vent here.\nWhy do fans think they can change the outcome of a drama thats already done? Where's the \"I like it bc is my taste\" or \"I dont like it bc its not my taste\"? Where's the acceptance that the drama is what it is, it's done and we can't change it? Not everyone is going to overlook what some overlooked to enjoy the drama (1st clue as to what they really think) If it is/was popular then it was entertaining for a lot of people and it has nothing to do with the quality of the drama (2nd clue as to what they really think) If it's underrated but was entertaining for you, it's the same thing it has nothing to do with the quality of the drama.  But there are some fans who have this obsessive need to FIX other people's reviews of the drama they like, they even tend to lie which makes no sense bc in theory some people will just go and watch the drama in question and still see what's lacking (3rd clue as to what they really think, and actually overlookkng of themselves, they kind of give themselves away too easily, they basically think the same as critics except they have a hard time admitting it). My point is their insistence won't make the drama's flaws disappear. Is important to differentiate hate from criticism there are quite a few people like me who are quite analytical so I can't just overlook (the favorite word🙄) the lie you told me abt the content of the drama. I feel scammed. Nothing you said happened. Are we talking abt the same drama? Why are you making things up? \"I think this is bc blah, blah, blah.\" YOU are not a writer this is not wattpad. if it's a comedy or whatever and had very little intention of giving closure to the plot and subplots that were introduced, then it's an entertaining comedic drama that doesn't take itself that seriously therefore it didn't give importance to the plot and subplots, why? the point was just to entertain. So stop lying/being contradictory saying it has a good plot bc if you had to overlook many things is bc the plot wasnt that good😒\n\nEdit: I'm not generalizing; it's just a few people. I wrote this post knowing that there will be some who disagree, others who probably won't understand what I'm talking abt and others who will. This is a public post, so that's obviously going to happen😁",

    "content": "Hi all. I’ve just finished Uncontrollably Fond and wanted to hear others thoughts. \n\nPlease skip this post if you haven’t watched it and don’t want the show spoiled for you. \n\nSo let me start by saying I’m a crier. I cried at My Mister, I sobbed at My Dearest, I was a mess after watching Mr Plankton. I like to be in my feels. I thought this show would give me that..it did not. \n\nFirst of all, why are most of the characters such despicable, heinous people?! I’m fine with a few morally grey characters, even nasty villains, but in this kdrama nearly every character is just a horrible person. \n\nIf I had a mother that &gt;!abandoned me purely because I gave up on being a prosecutor just because her ex was, I would never speak to her again. He put up with 5 years of emotional abuse and guilt tripping!&lt; I did not like her at all. \n\nEven the ML was pissing me off blowing hot and cold rather than just being honest with the FL. &gt;!He was really horrible at times to the FL just because he wanted to hide his illness from her rather than just being honest. In the end I lost interest in their relationship and didn’t really care about the ending. I wasn’t upset by the ending, wasn’t phased that he died, I just wanted the drama to finish!&lt;\n\nIt’s like the writers thought, let’s not focus on the story and the character development, let’s see how many tropes we can get in there. &gt;!There was second chance romance, enemies to lovers, amnesia, workplace romance, love triangle, rich ML-poor FL!&lt;\n\nAlso I’ve never seen Bae Suzy in a kdrama before but I found her to be OTT and quite shouty and whiney. Maybe that’s just how they wrote her character. She’s really pretty though. This is also my first Kim Woo Bin show and I think he’s a really good actor. \n\nIt was so frustrating in my opinion. ",

I especially loved how it contrasts the lives of two men under the same roof one reckless and carefree, the other trapped in an impossible situation. I am not sure if any previous k-drama was made at the back drop of Asian imf crisis. This seems refreshingly new.\n\nThe entire cast delivers fantastic performances, but Kim Min-ha truly stands out. She’s such a breath of fresh air, so natural and grounded. It’s refreshing to see someone who looks and feels like a real person on Korean TV. She seems so authentic not another model-looking actress in designer clothes pretending to be poor. You could totally relate to her. Absolutely loving her and the show so far.",

It’d be nice if we could keep things respectful and focus on how timing and fairness play into cases like this.\n\nKim Soo-hyun is reportedly set to appear in court in November, over a 500 million KRW lawsuit filed by VT Cosmetics. The brand ended his endorsement earlier this year, saying it became difficult to fulfil the contract after rumours about him and Kim Sae-Ron started circulating.\n\nThe thing is, that situation still hasn’t been resolved in court. There’s no verdict and nothing has been officially proven or confirmed. So it raises a question: **if there’s no outcome yet, did VT do the right thing by cutting ties and suing, or should they have waited until things were clearer?**\n\nIt feels like one of those situations where timing really matters.

    "title": "FL of \"My Dearest\" is pathetic",
    "content": "I am a real fan of sageuks dramas, but i really couldn't watch \"My Dearest\" and one of the biggest reasons have to be the female lead.\nNow that I will be talking about the female lead, I am tending to talk about the character of \"Gil Chae\" and not the actress \"Ahn Eun Jin\" because she is such a fabulous actor and an absolute sweetheart.\nGil Chae literally frustrated me the entire time! Here's why: \n\n1. Her actions in the early episodes are deeply problematic\n\nSeducing someone else's fiancé/boyfriend to make Yeon Joon jealous who is her friend's (Eun Ae) fiancé. Manipulative. Playing with an innocent guy’s feelings. Selfish. Even after the death of the poor innocent guy, she keeps trying to seduce Yeon Joon again and again when he clearly tells her to stop doing it because he's her friend's fiancé. Deliberately seducing others to put other girls down by calling them 'not as pretty as her'. Major “pick me” energy taken to the extreme. From a moral and emotional standpoint, she’s chaotic and reactive, not reflective or grounded.\nI personally love heroines with agency, dignity, and emotional spine Like Sung Duk Im (The Red Sleeve), Hae Soo (Moon Lovers),  Arang (Arang and the magistrate), Dong Joo (Tale of Nokdu), Soo Hyang (Scholar who walks the night), this behavior is instantly off putting.\nHer “strategy” is basically self centered emotional chaos. It lacks a sense of consequence or maturity in handling real relationships.\n\n2. Male lead falling for her is deeply illogical\n\nHow does a competent, principled man fall for someone who constantly manipulates, lies, and flirts with others while engaged?\nIn the context of historical romance, male leads are usually attracted to a mix of virtue + challenge + emotional resonance. But here? The attraction is basically scripted to happen, without earning it. There is no believable emotional bridge between them. I am someone who respond to earned devotion, this is a huge disconnect. You cannot suspend disbelief for a bond that is built on manipulation.\n\n3. She repeatedly ruins the men in her orbit\n\nYes. She seduces, cheats, breaks hearts, and jumps from one engagement to another. The moment when she was engaged to Won Moo but still decided to run away with Lee jang hyun and then at the end up turning her back on Jang hyun and going back to marry Won Moo-- so questionable! All because she isn't old enough to understand her feelings and the consequences of her decisions?? Next level immaturity. When she gets kidnapped to Qing and comes back to her husband who rejects her because she got raped, she says \"yes i will divorce you, not because you ask me to do that, but because I fell in love with Jang Hyun when I was back in Qing\". Gurl? Isn't he the man you ran off with right before the day of your wedding but then turned you back on him and abandoned him because of your 'reputation'. There’s zero narrative accountability for her behavior....which makes her unrelatable and frustrating, especially if you value heroes and heroines who navigate emotion responsibly. How can we even ignore the fact that by the time she was 'falling in love with Jang Hyun again' back in Qing, she was still a supposedly married woman whose husband hasn't turned his back on her yet. She is emotionally immature, and the story doesn’t address it. Instead, it treats it as “romance tension,” which was a huge mismatch for me.\n\n4. Emotional immaturity &amp; lack of growth\n\nA heroine who cannot manage her own feelings, but the plot still wants us to root for her love story. Classic frustration trap.\nFor comparison -- Duk Im, Hae Soo, Arang, Dong Joo and Soo Hyang, all made mistakes, yes, but their mistakes are earned, reflective, and teach them something, so the viewer trusts their emotional judgment. Here? It’s all surface level drama manipulation. No emotional growth, no moral compass, no lessons.\n\n5. Why it’s impossible to root for her\n\nI am a viewer who needs emotional tethering and earned connection. Her actions actively break the possibility of tethering, because she is not building an authentic relationship, she’s creating chaos to fuel plot. This explains why even if the male lead is supposed to be “soulmates” with her, I cannot buy it.\n\n\nSo basically,\nChaotic manipulator, not emotionally mature. No earned connection with the male lead. Repeatedly ruins men’s lives, no accountability. Story treats her immaturity as “romance tension,” not a flaw. Contrasts sharply with the kind of heroines I love (dignified, agency driven, soulful, and reflective)\nHonestly, I would even argue that the female lead is the single largest barrier to the drama being emotionally unsatisfying, even if the plot had other redeeming qualities. For someone like me, who needs emotional authenticity and depth, she’s basically the antithesis of what I look for in a sageuk heroine.",

But it is 16 episodes long; Empress Ki is 51 episodes. 51! And I watched it till the end without feeling bored for a single minute.\n\nEmpress Ki has superb world-building, very in-depth explorations of the characters in the drama. It has plot twists that you would have never guessed would happen. It subverts normal story lines you have seen in other kdramas so many times, it is hard to believe. \n\nBut I am never going to watch it again and I am glad that the last episode ended. This drama is not for the weak. So much cruelty, so many betrayals, so many heartbreaks. After watching halfway through, I thought I lost a little bit of my humanity. Ok, that might be a slight exaggeration, but this drama is really something. The best description of this drama I think would be cold-bolded.

I am curious to see what other countries get mentioned in shows and if your country in particular has been on the K-drama radar. \n\nI am from the Neterlands and my country has been mentioned a couple times:\n\n**Doctor John**\n\nIn this series, euthanasia is a big topic. The Netherlands was the first country in the world to make (active) euthanasia legal, so it makes sense to talk about it in the show. They also mentioned the case of [https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truus\\_Postma](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truus_Postma)), who was not the first doctor to perform euthanasia in the Netherlands, but her case became nationally and internationally known and it caused a lot of debate. I did not know about this case before, so it was interesting to learn about it. \n\nThey also mention the non-profit organisation Stichting Ambulancewens (similar to Make-A-Wish-foundation, but anyone with a terminal illness can have their wish fulfilled).  \n\n  \n**Royal Secret Inspector and Joy**\n\nThis is a fictional historical drama. In the story there is a Korean group of merchants trading with the VOC (an actual Dutch trades company that existed for over 400 years). In one shot, a letter in Dutch was shown to the camera. Fun fact, there were no mistakes in the letter, but it was way too modern to be believeable as a 16th/17th century letter. But it's the thought that counts, right?\n\n\n\n**Rookie historian Goo Hae Ryung**\n\nIn this fictional historical drama, a foreigner is caught and taken prisoner. An official tries to talk to him with the help of a Korean-Dutch dictionary. He turns out not to be Dutch, but their was a reason there was a Dutch dictionary in Joseon. In the 16th century a Dutch ship stranded on Jeju Island and Korea being an isolated country back then, refused to let the sailers return home or continue their journey. The captain of the ship, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick\\_Hamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Hamel), soon found out they weren't even the first Dutch people in Korea. A man sailor named [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan\\_Jansz\\_Weltevree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Jansz_Weltevree) was captured 27 years before them and he was their interpreter in the beginning. Naturally there had been enough time to exchange languages and to write a dictionary. \n\n  \nSo, what K-drama should I watch if I want to learn more about your country? ",

In particular, here for all the food porn (and the romance too ofc, but as a French person who loves to cook everything and anything, food is very high up in the list of my life-long loves).\n\nI was pretty surprised by the schnitzel episode. Nothing wrong with flour crumbs per se, but since that supposes the existence of flour, I was wondering what kept our fave 3-star chef from actually making bread.\n\nBread only requires flour, water, and in the absence of yeast, sourdough, which can be made with a starter of flour and water.\n\nThis is pretty niche, but does anyone know what historical fact would have kept her from baking bread? Is it that they didn't have the right type of wheat? Or they didn't have the right kind of oven / any kind of oven? (On the latter, they went so far as to invent a pressure cooker - an oven seems trivial in comparison, but I'd be interested to learn whether they didn't exist in Joseon for whatever reason.)\n\nOf course, as much as I'd have loved to see the male lead's very photogenic lips tear into some crunchy bread crust, I do enjoy the show as it is! This one was just nagging at me; would love to read your thoughts.\n\nEDIT: Reading up across historical data on the topic, my personal best guest is, it boils down to a matter of efficiency. Getting an oven hot enough to bake bread would use up a very large amount of fuel. The only reason this was viable in the West is because wheat was the main cereal, and so ovens were mutualised for bread production for an entire community. However, in East Asia rice was much more common than wheat, and rice is best cooked over a flame, which wastes less heat and fuel. And so any wheat harvested then would have been cooked in a similar way: dumplings steamed over an open flame, rather than anything baked. \n\nSo in short, making bread in East Asia at the time would probably have been *way* too wasteful.\n\nIf anyone has information to the contrary, please shout!",

I feel the way show carried itself from the beginning it left only a little part for the romance which was not sufficient I would say but still not bad, but not good.\n\nAnd the way the show structured around the food and being showcased and capturing the reactions of those who taste the food, to show that the food is out of the world the way makers used the editing was truly commendable. And the show delivers what's it purpose was, when you see the food being showcased you feel that you are hungry sometimes you may even drool yourself. The way the show explains about the history of its food and ingredients used in it was commendable, it shows that they did not dumb down the show and also made the viewers to  engage with show which very rare now a days. \n\nThe humour of the show works very well as well. The only drawback I would say was it's dialogue delivery it feels too caricaturish and sometimes unbearable, you will be like why the hell are they talking like this.\n\nAlso the set designers deserve a big applause as the set pieces do not feel like they have been built they all feel natural which is a big positive.\n\nOverall a good show around the food with a good humour and decent romance although the ending is predictable still I enjoyed it. I would say GO FOR IT. \n\n",

    "content": "I’ve been watching Kdramas for 15 years now. The first one I watched was when I was 14 which was Boys over Flowers. There’s so many things I’ve noticed that have changed and evolved over the years and I thought it would be such an interesting and fun discussion. \n\n1. Finding/watching dramas used to be such a pain in the a** because it was difficult to find subs or places to watch, and now it’s extremely easy thanks to the hallyu wave of the early-mid 2010s \n\n2. There’s a lot less “offensive” material; portrayals of people with disabilities (both mental and physical) have improved and I would say the way foreigners are shown has improved even though there is MUCH to be desired for both. \n\n3. mainstreaming into streaming platforms. I gasped when I saw Love Alarm; it was the first ever Netflix original kdrama which now, 6 years later Netflix is dominating over prime and Disney + \n\n4. General progressiveness and ditching a lot of the misogynistic/dangerous portrayals of what “relationship goals” are \n\n5. SEASONS! I never thought that we would ever get multiple season continuations of kdramas. I think this started around 2016-2017. \n\n6. I’ll be honest, and maybe we can talk about it; the 20 and 16 episode format seems to be phasing out now. Don’t know how I feel. I’ve seen some that had a nice tight and neat plot that was perfect for 8. 10 or 12 episode iterations.. but bon appetit your majesty definitely needed 16. It seems that 12 episodes are the standard across most if not all broadcasting companies with some outliers in streaming services. \n\n",

My overall rating on it is 5.5/10. I felt like a couple of things felt kind of weird. Ending was so... whatever and it didn't make any sense and it felt so rushed. They just didn't make a thorough lead up to the antagonists ending.\n\n\nI really liked these kdramas:\n\nThe Glory(11/10 in my book)\n\nMr. Queen\n\nWelcome To Waikiki(I give it a 7.5/10.. I dropped the second Waikiki kdrama)\n\nHeavenly Ever After(although sad, I give it an 8/10) \n\nWhen Life Gives You Tangerines(8.5/10, sad but it was a good watch)\n\nReply 1988(9/10, comforting kdrama and would watch again)\n\nVincenzo(8.5/10)\n\nKing The Land(8/10, very nice chemistry between leads and also good watch)\n\nBloodhounds(8/10)\n\n\n\nKdramas I DONT LIKE:\n\nWeightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo (hard to keep attention on this)\n\nWelcome To SamDal-Ri(loose ends on certain scenes and it turned out kind of bad and confusing)\n\n\n\nAnyways, I would like to hear your recommendations! I am considering a couple like \"Officer Black Belt\" with Kim Woo Bin and maybe 25 21(?) If you have some good watch kdramas like the ones I listed above, please let me know!

Its love triangle wasn’t just there for tension, it actually added emotional depth to the story. It beautifully captured teenage love, infatuation, confusion, and even the quiet regrets that come with growing up.\n\nWhat I love about Reply 1988 is that the triangle didn’t feel forced — it reflected real feelings that change with time, and how love can mean different things at different stages of life. It made the story feel more human and bittersweet rather than dramatic for the sake of it.\n\nWhat are some other K-dramas where you felt the love triangle actually made sense and added something meaningful to the story?\n",

    "content": "Okay, it doesn't have to be a TEN literally - I tend to be very generous with 10s on MyDramaList, even though the only absolutely perfect drama I've ever seen was Healer. 😉 So let me rephrase:\n\n**What kdrama did you go into not expecting to love it so much that you'd end up rating it as high as your most beloved dramas?**\n\nFor me, it was **Bring It On, Ghost**. I only watched it because it's spooky season and I wanted to see Taecyeon in something different from his role in Vincenzo. I thought it would just be a cute little ghost show, but it was more than that for me.\n\nI loved the cute love story (complete with kdrama tropes like the umbrella, fall and catch, watching someone sleep, and falling asleep next to someone who's sick). I loved the spoooooky ghosts - like seriously some of them were really frightening. 😂 I loved the dynamic of the two club officers - they were over-the-top in the *best* ways. I laughed so hard at them. And I really loved seeing actors I'd only seen a few times before (because I'm still a kdrama baby - this was only my 50th kdrama) - Taecyeon (Vincenzo), Kim So Hyun (Love Alarm, Goblin), Kang Ki Young (What's Wrong with Secretary Kim), Lee Da Wit (Squid Game), and Kim Sang Ho (The Haunted Palace). I also loved Lee Jung Eun's barely-there cameos - especially since the last thing I watched her in was Strangers from Hell. 😂\n\nIt wasn't perfect by any means - I hated the FL's mother so GD much (and she's not even the worst kdrama mama by a mile). And the last episode seemed a bit off because it was like 2 minutes of defeating the bad guy and the rest was how they all lived after that. It felt weird, but I didn't *hate* it - it was just a different pace from the rest of the show.",

    "content": "It’s my ALL-TIME favorite show! But I’ve rewatched it so many times ’cause I’m obsessed—and I desperately wanna get that “first watch” rush back. But I can’t find a single reaction to it on any platform, ugh. I get it, it’s a political/historical drama, so the entry barrier’s prob pretty high. But those goosebump-inducing moments, those insane characters… the fight scenes… just thinking about how there’s zero reactions to this masterpiece feels like such a crime🥺",

    "content": "IT'S SOOOOO GOOD\nThe chemistry is endless, I LOVE THEM.\nSuzy and Kim Woobin had me glued to the screen the whole time. \nI waited a long time for it and they didn't disappoint.\nIt was only 13 episodes and I didn't feel like it was slow or difficult to watch. In fact, I need more episodes! Kdramas are getting shorter and shorter 😔🤬\nThe kdrama made me laugh and act like Park Hyungsik in Strong Woman Do Bong-soon for the most part, it also has its 💔🤧 side.\nIt made me cry out of happiness and sadness.\nI know actors doing comedy tend to get belittled, but not anymore. Seriously, every episode went by and I was amazed at how well Kim Woobin played the funny scenes, and obviously the heartbreaking scenes were perfect too. He's a great actor. I need him to win some awards.\nI went through the episodes so fast that I had to stop for a few days because I didn't want to finish the kdrama and feel the emptiness it leaves behind, I really waited a long time since Uncontrollably Fond.\nIt often happens that some kdramas focus on 99,999 supporting characters and leave us with almost no material about the main couple, but not this one.\nThe supporting characters were very good, they had an interesting plot and didn't overwhelm the entire kdrama. The main couple really shined 🥹✨\nI loved the plot. I didn't know about the connection they showed between Korea and Arab countries, so they made me research that.\nThe same goes for the religion, it introduced me to some characters and the history.\nThe ppl who don't like it because it touches their religion... I'm not going to go into that because even though I know damn right what I can say to all those people, there's no point in arguing with them because they're religious fanatics! That's why they have that opinion. The kdrama was very respectful.\nTo sum it up, 7777777/10 no notes",

But as I wrote (the post) and used AI images, I think I gradually came to believe they were real,\" the person wrote. All content on both accounts has since been deleted.\n\n&gt; On Monday, the person claimed in an anonymous online blog post to have had a conversation with Lee, saying the 36-year-old actor made unwanted sexual advances and even requested explicit photos. The post, titled \"Exposing the real Lee Yi-kyung,\" included what the author claimed were screen captures of the conversation supposedly held via messaging applications.\n\n&gt; Lee's agency, Sangyoung ENT, released a statement around 5:43 p.m. the same day, vowing to take legal action against what it said were malicious rumors. Multiple internet users also suggested that the images were fake, pointing to details like the conversation appearing to have taken place on both Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy devices.\n\n&gt; The author deleted the original post later in the day and wrote on the blog that they were not seeking money, as some had suggested. However, the individual reiterated the claim that the messages were real.\n\n&gt; But early Wednesday, the person admitted that the whole thing had been a prank. It is unclear to what extent the blogger's claims about their identity were true -- such as being German. All the posts were written in Korean.\n\n\nSource: https://m.koreaherald.com/article/10598835\n\n",

Honestly, I started watching it mainly because of Yoon Eun Hye which I find really cute, and I think she’s a great actress. I also liked her pairing with Kang Ji Hwan; they matched each other’s energy so well and made every scene enjoyable to watch.\n\nWhat I loved most was how the drama balanced emotion and humor. It had plenty of fun and heartwarming moments that made me laugh, but it also had those sincere and touching scenes that stayed with me. The main male lead’s thoughtful and supportive personality really stood out, especially in the way he stayed strong for the woman he loved despite the challenges around them.\n\nThe cinematography was also beautiful, and the scenes filmed in Jeju Island were stunning. My only small issue was that the ending felt a bit dragged out, but overall, it didn’t take away from how much I enjoyed it.\n\n*Lie to Me* is the kind of romantic comedy that’s sappy, cheesy, but genuinely heartfelt. It’s light, funny, and emotional in all the right ways. Definitely a feel-good drama worth watching.",

    "title": "K-Drama review: Daily Dose of Sunshine",
    "content": "This is a drama that I’ve wanted to watch since around March-April, but after seeing the description and subject matter. It’s one I’ve needed to build myself up to watch. That being said, 2 days ago, I just said, “Fine, I’ll finally watch it”. While I do sort of regret not watching it sooner, I also don’t(if you understand.)\n\nThis follows a nurse, Jung Da Eun (Park Bo Young), as she navigates the field of neuropsychiatry, facing many challenges along the way. It’s a rather brief description, and the show delves deep into mental health.\n\nThis is a very heavy show if you’re sensitive to these topics. I wouldn’t recommend. The first 6 episodes are rough but not as dark as the second half gets. It deals with a plethora of issues/disorders, and I believe it handles them delicately, whilst also showing the realism behind them. I liked how characters could relate to others through situations they have been through; it gave the side characters charm and depth. It also made me care about them. \n\nThe romance didn’t pull me into this drama, nor did it keep me watching. It was a nice break from all the gloomy subject matter. But I thought the main romance was just ok. The relationship between Min Deul Re and Hwang Yeo Hwan was much more enticing. I’m not here for the romantic relationships anyway.\n\nI did like that the best friend sort of just gave up his romantic pursuit of the lead. They didn’t drag it out. There wasn’t even a big scene where he confesses and gets rejected. He just accepts that it’ll never be his role in her life. I wasn’t too big a fan of the guy she ended up with. But given the circumstances. It’s fine.\n\nPark Bo Young won awards for this performance, and it’s well deserved. No matter the quality of the show/movie, the thing that stays constant is that PBY always delivers a brilliant performance, bringing a level of skill that comes with experience and hard work. It’s always exciting to see what she does.\n\nOverall, I’m giving this show a 9/10. It would be a 10, this is just a show I don’t see myself ever rewatching. It makes you feel down despite trying to lift you as well. If you don’t feel this drama, you’ll never be able to truly understand it. I see myself rewatching in 10-15 years and having a different perspective.",

    "content": "Please read this-\n\n• You can only cast your votes for the genre and label stated in the title and the highest voted drama shall be displayed in the corresponding box the next day.\n\n• Some dramas are multi genre so repetition is allowed as opinions are subjective. A drama may be nominated again for a different category even if it has won earlier.\n\n• The vote grid is designed to capture the community's genuine preferences, but repeated nominations and strategic upvoting introduce bias. This creates an uneven playing field, making it unfair for other participants and their choices. Hence the highest upvoted comment shall be considered in such scenarios.\n\n• It is not possible for me to accommodate a multitude of genres as it would make the grid too big. Once this series is done, I will post another series based on the genres suggested by you all.\n\n• **Please REFRAIN from downvoting. This isn't really a competition. It's just a fun grid. If you dont agree with an opinion, dont upvote it. Down voting opinions will lead to people not giving their true opinion which isn't what this grid activity is about.**\n\nThe winner for **MAKJANG** drama that was **OVERRATED** is **QUEEN OF TEARS** with **18** votes. \n\n1st runner up is **THE PENTHOUSE** with **10** votes. \n\nLink to the previous grid- https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/s/jevQkDRCTC\n\nThese are some of the parameters that can be considered for a show to be underrated. However, these are suggestive in nature and not all parameters need to qualify.\n\n**Overrated- Considered to be better than it really is**\n\n• High Popularity Despite Not Having High Quality. The drama has some weak writing or maybe some weak acting or weak production (doesn't need to have all 3 reasons) but it still gained widespread attention. It remains popular even though it deserves less recognition. Dramas that can be nominated are those that either are beloved in both, South Korea as well internationally/online or those that were unsuccessful in South Korea yet popular internationally/online or popular in South Korea yet unsuccessful internationally/online.\n\n• Good Promotion or Marketing. Good advertising or buzz from the network or platform it was streamed on. Many viewers are aware of the drama.\n\n• Overshadowed smaller releases. Released alongside less hyped or less star-studded shows that deserved more popularity.\n\n• It has a star studded cast or popular writer/ director's name attached to it which helped in it's success.\n\n• Dramas that have been nominated for/won awards can also be nominated if YOU found them to be overrated.\n\n• High ratings or viewership stats. It might have been successful with TV ratings in its home country or streaming numbers.\n\n**• Whether a drama is overrated or not is a subjective opinion. It doesn't mean that the drama is bad. It just means that the drama is not as good as it's hype.**\n\n**Please note-**\n\n**This is the third and final grid (for now). If I get enough suggestions, I will make a 4th one. If you have any suggestions for other genres that I might have missed, please write them in the comments. Thank you.**",

    "content": "Isn’t the term \"second lead syndrome\" getting a bit overused? \n\nIt seems like people throw it around whenever they don’t like the ML and want the FL to end up with SML. They’ll say things like, “Oh, the second male lead is such a poor guy; he was always there for her.” \n\nIt feels like they’re just trying to drum up sympathy for the SML without considering what the female lead actually wants. They want her to break up with the ML and choose the SML, who they adore so they doesn’t really care about her feelings or who she loves the most. Most of the time people support SML by their looks not character ( example: nice guy Kdrama, where people were shipping with a stalker and creepy SML for FL)\n\nHonestly, I’m starting to dislike this term because of people using it simply.\n\nAll these second leads have one thing in common: they’re trying to win over someone else's girl. They can’t take no for an answer and are just waiting for a chance to swoop in when there’s a rift between the male lead and the female lead, ready to show that they’re there for her during tough times. That’s the classic second male lead trope. Sure, there are some decent second male leads who, after realizing they have no chance or getting rejected, will step back.\n\nBut most of them? They just won’t give up. Even after being turned down, they’ll insist to the female lead that they’ll keep pursuing her ams won’t respect her boundaries or worda.Those kinds of characters can be pretty shameless.\n\nI’ve seen so many people trying to create sympathy for second male leads by using this syndrome and putting down the male lead characters.\n\nWhat do you think about all this?

    "content": "Hi!  \nI **really** like historical dramas, and I feel like I’ve binge-watched every Korean one on Netflix.  \nRight now I’m watching a chinese drama, and I’m looking for another good historical series to watch afterwards.\n\nI usually prefer dramas that are long, have political or court intrigue, and aren’t too focused on romance. I don’t mind a love story being part of it - I just don’t want the whole show to revolve around it. By that I mean, I’d rather see more story and action than endless romantic scenes.\n\nI also don’t like when things get too fantasy-heavy. A little unreal is fine, but not when it turns into full-on magic or supernatural stuff. It's also important for me that the drama has good production quality and solid acting. I’m fine with older series too!\n\nMy all-time favorite is Empress Ki, and I’ve been trying to find something similar but that feels almost impossible.\n\nBelow I’ve listed all the dramas, movies, and shows I’ve already watched (both historical and modern), with my ratings included.  \nIf you have any well-made, political, or long historical dramas to recommend, please send them my way.

I’m not even sure why, it just didn’t click for me.\n\nI also don’t feel the urge to rewatch it, which says a lot. But I do recognize that this is based on personal taste.

It’s heartbreakingly beautiful. The way it portrays grief, hope, and the little bittersweet moments of life just hits different. Every scene felt like it was carefully designed to sink into your heart.\nAnd IU… oh my god, IU’s acting. She doesn’t just act; she lives the pain and hope of her character. Every glance, every pause, every little tear felt so real that I couldn’t hold back my own. There were moments I literally cried uncontrollably. Meanwhile, my brother sat there, stone-faced, didn’t shed a single tear 😭. Like, how? How is that even human?\nIf you want a series that’s sad, beautiful, and completely gut-wrenching, this is it. The way it balances life’s fragility with these fleeting moments of beauty… it’s unforgettable.\n\nDeath of The ML is really the saddest of all . Rip gwan sik. I cried the whole show and try delaying watching the episodes but my brother he is just different he sad it's just a show but what it really is something else\n\nHonestly, I feel like I need to just sit in silence for a while after finishing it. Has anyone else gone through this and just lost it?\n\nP.S :- How did IU did that crying scenes ?? I felt that like it wasnt acting its just she cried so naturally. In My mister too she nailed the crying scenes . Is it onle me finding that she nailed crying scenes ?",

    "content": "Went into this not expecting much, very pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable and a breezy watch it was. Solid 8/10 for me. I liked that this show doesn't attempt to be more than it is – it's a straightforward, healing drama about four flawed people who are discovering what love is, perhaps for the first time in their mature lives.\n\nChocolate is the main theme, and it's woven into the storylines nicely. The FL is a chocolatier who can't look people in the eye due to severe anxiety and ML is the boss of that chocolate shop who can't touch people due to germophobia. She's actually a genius chocolatier but works there \"anonymously\" as a normal employee and thus unfolds their love story.\n\nThere's isn't any needless angst and the story moves quickly at 8 episodes, it was perfect for a binge-watch. Granted, the dialogue is mostly in Japanese but there's plenty of scenes that remind you of the quintessential Korean romantic comedy. The advantages of a Japan-Korea collab is well-utilised, making for plenty of funny moments. Such as having the FL swear under her breath in Korean about the ML as he doesn't understand her, while he eventually comes around to using Korean to express his feelings to her at the end.\n\nFound out it's written by the writer of Splash Splash Love, and was like ahh no wonder it's good. OST is really nice too. I would say it's one of the better dramas on offer recently! ",

But I can't help noticing that the physical affection between the couples starts to decline after their declarations of love. At most, they hug and the MLs pat the FL's back (??!). What happened to the kissing and cuddling? \n\nSo I'm asking what other shows manage to keep the couples physically attracted to each other even after they've gotten together? For reference, I love shows where the leads start off not liking each other, or initially have non-romantic ulterior motives for getting together. I just need the couple to continue to display their affection! ",

The tactile, storybook style immediately signals whimsy with a twist. As one blogger enthused, it *“so gorgeously and perfectly integrates with the story”and I absolutely agree. Even small details whisper backstory: look closely and you’ll spot fluttering paper butterflies among the branches. That’s no accident – Sang-tae is haunted by a butterfly from his childhood trauma In other words, the opening doesn’t just look pretty; it hints at the pain beneath. Moon-Young’s queenly gown, the blood-red drips on the thorns (a nod to Sleeping Beauty’s forest) – every piece echoes her bruised past or Sang-tae’s nightmares. This is her macabre fairytale world turned real.\n\nSYMBOLIC STORYBOOK SCENES &amp; EASTER EGGS\n\nA bit later, the camera reveals a white tower with a caged doll – pure Rapunzel territory. Moon-Young herself has been a kind of imprisoned princess, locked away by her abusive mother and cursed past. Seeing Rapunzel in the credits made me gasp: it’s as if the show is silently reminding us that Moon-Young’s life was a lonely tower. PopcornX blogger even points out that each shot is a classic fairytale reference – thorns for Sleeping Beauty, a crumbling castle for Beauty &amp; the Beast, and even green witch hats and ruby slippers for Oz. Critics compare the intro to “a whole spooky children’s show”, and it’s true: it really feels like every frame is a clue. The production even alternates the color palette by episode (warm sepia on Saturdays, stark black-and-white on Sundays with one vivid red pop), suggesting a switch between fantasy and stark reality. All this foreshadows how our characters’ fairy-tale illusions will later collide with real-life darkness.\n\nLater in the intro, a single bright red shoe perched on dusty books immediately made me think of Dorothy’s slippers. That shot isn’t random color-play – it’s a direct nod to The Wizard of Oz and the idea of finding your way home. For Moon-Young, the “red shoes” might symbolize her desire to escape her cruel “cursed castle” childhood and find her true path (and maybe hint that she’s not in Kansas anymore). Fans online even note the contrast in that scene: a monochrome study with one pop of color – a clever visual hook. In fact, viewers rave about how the opening’s music matches these images: one says “the opening song… it’s beautiful and so well paired to the show”. When I listen to the music swell under that red shoe scene, I feel both whimsy and warning – exactly the sweet-then-spooky mix the show thrives on.\n\nTHE “SKETCHBOOK” THEME SONG – LYRICS &amp; ATMOSPHERE\n\nThe intro’s dreaminess is sealed by Janet Suhh’s song “Sketchbook”. Right off the bat, the lyrics open with “There was once upon a time / And all people have stories of their own…”. It’s a fairy-tale line that sounds comforting but also reminds us everyone’s life is a story, not a neat Disney tale. Then come the striking lines, “It’s not your fairy tale, no”. This feels like a bold declaration against happy-ever-after; Moon-Young basically writes twisted fairy tales, so the song winks, “Hey, life isn’t that sugarcoated.” Later the lyrics soothe, “Don’t be afraid… All these are part of you”, which I read as the drama’s core message: embrace your scars and fears. The gentle, lullaby melody mixed with this candid lyricism gave me chills. It’s like the show is literally singing to Ko Moon-Young and Gang-Tae: “You’ve both been through hell, but that doesn’t make you broken.” A fangirl from DramawithKimchi nailed it: even she “had to pull out her phone a few times” just to identify this OST – it’s that striking. When Janet Suhh sings “all these are part of you,” I feel their pain and hope at once. Visuals and Music in Harmony – Foreshadowing &amp; Healing Putting it all together, the opening’s art and music perfectly foreshadow the drama’s journey. Those handcrafted dioramas (thorns, towers, slippers) quietly map out Moon-Young’s and Gang-Tae’s inner worlds: trauma, isolation, false facades. The lullaby vocals and honest lyrics then blanket those images with empathy. It’s telling that the song reassures, “Don’t be afraid” – a promise that characters won’t face their demons alone. By the time the opening ends, I’m already invested: Gang-Tae’s steady presence in a storybook land hints he’ll guide her out of darkness, and Moon-Young reaching toward light suggests she’ll learn kindness. As one reviewer put it, this intro sequence could almost stand alone as a short film. For a media-savvy fan like me, those subtle cues are gold: the red shoe, the butterfly, the shadowy castle – they all clicked with character backstories I knew. And hearing the song’s gentle reminder (“It’s not your fairy tale, no”) makes it feel deeply personal. In the end, this opening doesn’t just greet us; it whispers the show’s promise that even broken fairy tales can lead to healing.\n\nI took a bit help from Ai to fix the Ai and put it in a sentence and paraphrase it.",

    "content": "(Okay I am asking this out of curiosity so please be nice to me 😭😭😭)\n\nOkay I guess everyone knows what happened in that event and to those who don’t know, W Korea held like a breast cancer awareness event but it turns out they didn’t donate that much for the cause and some things that were done in the event were inappropriate like not wearing pink, questionable song choices and ppl drinking everywhere so the event got into very valid criticism.\n\nBut I’ve been noticing something, why are the idols the ones getting the heat more than the actors?? Like if you search about it on tiktok or on other social media platforms the first things shown are BTS, Aespa, etc and we all know that there are many celebrities who attended that event and that includes actors. I’ve been noticing a lot that the criticism went more on the idols than the actors which makes me wonder, if they say that all who attended the event were guilty, why is it only the idols getting the lashings and not the actors? Like if you want to call out everyone, that includes the actors too right? Idk it seems a bit unfair to me\n\nLike I get it I guess all celebrities needed that criticisms but why are the idols the only one getting the lashings but not the actors?\n\nIs it because k actors are much more treated well in the industry than the idols or the idols have much more popularity and because many idols came they are more subject to exposure?\n\n",

Still, this one stood out as something different compared to the usual legal stories I’ve seen. I actually finished it quite fast, partly because it had that distinct SBS vibe. What sets it apart is that the main leads are not portrayed as the typical “perfect for the sake of justice” characters. Ju Ji Hoon as Yoon Hee Jae is arrogant, but not in an irritating way, his character is strong because of his actual skills, not his connections. On the other hand, Kim Hye Soo as Jung Geum Ja was simply brilliant casting. She’s on a whole different level in terms of acting, and she carried her role so powerfully. The drama also delves into themes of wealth and privilege, showing how the rich are often the ones being defended despite their questionable morals. It presented the idea of justice in a very different way, which I found refreshing. The only thing I didn’t quite like was the title *Hyena* and how they tried to tie it into the story, it felt a bit awkward to me. Still, a second season would definitely be welcome.",

The story is good made me cry for each episodes. Here's what I saw, let's start with the inconsistent part unless they are also time travellers (I think it's the drummer one) HE LITERALLY HAVE A MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE SHIRT, PRECISELY THE BLACK PARADE. BLACK PARADE NOT BE RELEASED UNTIL 2006 THE SERIES IS SET IN 1995. Still that's not much of an issue, here's another one Cheong Ah's father, Idk if the tutor is a stepmom or whatever their relationship seems to be professional, while Cheong Ah's dad is also professional as well, but at the same time the tutor's children act like they own all the  things the chairman. ONE BIG THING, WHY WAS CHEONG AH'S MOM TAKEN AWAY? WE NEVER SAW HER IN ANY OTHER EPISODES UNLIKE Mr. Johnathan (Mr. Viva).\n\nDon't get me started with the ending, it feels so sad that Gyeol never made up with his dad, it would be nice if everything stayed the same in the original timeline with little tweaks. cuz I think the rewriting the whole timeline really made things unlikeable. Everything was served rushed and we have to all just take it in like THE STORY BUILD UP WAS GREAT. Plus Choi Se-Kyung played a huge role in the 1995 role (we know it's her daughter) but still, nothing happened in her mother's part it's so underdeveloped unlike Gyeol's.\n\nI can go on and on about this but everything from the start to episode 14 is great, 15-16 Idk, just meh to me. You can agree to disagree. I love the show but not the finale. The finale could have been well written but it wasn't.",

It felt very fresh to me at the time because I was mostly exposed to rom-coms.

The story spans about 15 years across 24 episodes, and it actually works. It doesn’t feel dragging. Both the protagonist and antagonist are smart and skilled in their roles, which makes the story even more engaging. As the drama progresses, it keeps getting better, which is rare.\n\nAnother strong point is the characters. Each one is distinct and well-developed, so it was easy for me to connect with them individually. The romance isn’t heavily focused on, but I think that was the right choice since the plot leans more towards revenge.\n\nI’ve always held this drama in high regard.

I saw Beyond the Bar a while ago but forgot about it but after Law and the City, i decided to give it a go and I LOVED IT! \nAnd you know what's weird? I don't even know why. I think it's the legal part? And I liked the teasing of romance between the main characters. I am not a fan of age gap but i think because i loved the concept of the show i would have let it slide. I loved thw second couple as well. The friendships were beautiful, workplace co-operation was fantastic. I would give this drama a 9/10. This is the first Kdrama I've watched in a while that i think I'm actually going to rewatch. I'm hearing rumors of a season 2? I wish; but if it doesn't happen, that's fine too. \nWhat did you think about Beyond The Bar?",

One of the main characters was a young woman with short, light brown hair who usually wore gray outfits and was romantically involved with the neighbor young man. Her whole arc was advancing in her career. \n\nI think they had a scene where it was night time and they met up between the houses. There was like a bench. I know there was lots of family drama and maybe cheating scandals too between the parents. \n\nI binged the whole thing when I was like 15 and got tired of waiting for the episodes to come out.

The show itself makes zero sense and the ending was weird. Nobody sought a real explanation for what was going on: they just make stuff up as they go and that becomes reality. They suggest what's going to happen, but there's no particular reason for it to be that way. Anyway, if you like Gong Yoo it's fun for his performance alone. I'm curious about what others think.",

I really enjoyed watching all the different foods being made. It had this calm, comforting vibe (at least during the good parts iykyk). But what got me the most were the emotions behind it. The last couple of episodes actually made me cry a few times. There were scenes that felt so selfless and romantic in a quiet way, not forced or dramatic. But then again, I’m hopeless romantic so I love that sappy stuff and love stories. \n\nAnd the ending… it was beautiful. Soft, meaningful, and it stayed with me. I’m really glad it was a good ending and they reunited 🥰.  I would been so sad if they didn’t 🥹 lol. \n\nWith all the mystery, trash TV, drama, and horror shows on Netflix I usually watch, this one felt refreshing and different. Also, the cooking inspired me to make some of the dishes myself. \n\nIt might not be everyone’s favorite, but it was special to me. Hope some of you enjoyed and appreciated it too 😊. \n\n****************\n******\n\n\nEDIT: It’s good to hear that this is actually a POPULAR opinion now. Just to CLARIFY: I only thought it wasn’t liked based on the posts on this subreddit and others. ",

So this is probably the first show I've seen a lot of them in and I don't know many of them. \n\nAnyways I'm glad there was a some closure at the end of season 2 basically trying to give you a happy ending for season 1 but the last episode of season 2 also had well for me a little bit of a shocking sad ending. Feel like a show with a lot of fights this is definitely a show for you. The show definitely had a good mix of action and fights and a well-balanced story being told in both seasons. 10/10 for me on both seasons. ",

    "content": "I loved Alchemy of Souls as a whole, but I have to say — the chemistry between Jang Uk and Mu-deok in Season 1 hit differently. Don’t get me wrong, I also enjoyed Season 2 and thought Go Yoon-jung did an amazing job as the real Naksu. I even liked that her chemistry with Jang Uk felt more physically expressive this time — after all, she’s the real Naksu. But still, there was something more emotionally magnetic about Season 1.\n\nIn Season 1, Jang Uk and Mu-deok had this deep emotional connection and mutual understanding that made every small moment between them feel special. I still remember when Mu-deok said, “Everyone in my life tried to kill me. You’re the only one who tried to save me.” And when Jang Uk later said, “Everyone ignored my desperation, but you understood and helped me.” Those lines mirrored each other beautifully — showing how they both found something in each other no one else gave them: understanding, trust, and purpose.\n\nMu-deok constantly challenged Jang Uk — pushing him beyond his limits, even putting him in danger sometimes, but she was also the reason he grew stronger. There were so many moments in Season 1 that captured their growth and connection perfectly.\n\nSeason 2, on the other hand, while visually stunning and full of great acting, felt a bit more generic in terms of romance. The chemistry between the actors was still great, but the writing made it feel more superficial. Instead of emotional or symbolic moments like in S1, we got the classic “misunderstanding” trope and Jang Uk looking confused whenever Bu-yeon said something similar to Mu-deok. I really wish they explored their bond and Naksu’s inner conflict more deeply. And honestly, I missed seeing badass Naksu in action too.\n\n Also Naksu is a really bold, badass character in general, even while she didn't have any powers in mudeoks body(s1) she still was such a strong character! Which is also whats missing in s2.\n\nBoth actresses absolutely nailed their roles — this isn’t about comparing them. It’s just that Season 1 had a kind of intimacy through trust and pain that Season 2 couldn’t quite replicate, even with great chemistry.",

Before that, I would like to say that this post might be **LONG** (so don't lose your patience). So, here we go:\n\nMany K-dramas have come and gone.

But there was one who made us experience everything and made us big fans of Korean dramas. Hands down to the ultimate **GOAT** of K-dramas: **Goblin** (2016)\n\nReleased in 2016, '**Goblin: The lonely and Great God**' is a drama which changed the trajectory of success of Korean dramas and gave a new lease of life, a kind of comeback. Before that, success rate of Korean dramas had dried up for last 1-2 years. There is a rule of success for every drama that the makers of '**Goblin**' perfectly used - *use every genre with a taste of change*. It's true that most of the k-dramas had used themes which had become repeatable (for example, '**The Heirs**' unsuccessfully tried to remake the success of **'Boys Over Flowers**'). In '**Goblin**', you will find every genre and every theme- fantasy, tragedy, comedy - with perfection and elegance. Every scene was like watching a dream- the concept of *immortality, love and tragedy* destined with fate were displayed perfectly along with comedic elements. Despite the issues of age-gaps and not so perfect CGI, there is absolutely nothing you can't complain about, mostly because of hard-hitting plot with equally heart-breaking twists and a script filled with tension-releasing elements. Truly an excellent job done by the makers.\n\nThe most interesting part of this drama's success is it's cast performance and boy O' boy, this is the most perfect performances I have watched since '**I Hear Your Voice**'. The leads - **Gong Yoo** (a true GOAT superstar), **Lee Dong-Wook**, **Kim Go-Eun** and **Yoo In-na** \\- were perfect in their performances and also the chemistry they shared in the scenes together was awesome. **Gong Yoo**, after gaining international success with '**Train to Busan**', capped off the year with an all-timer performance as the titular **Goblin AKA Kim Shin**. His character had everything that suited **Gong Yoo**'s personality, and on a serious note, nobody could have performed this character the way he did. **Kim Go-Eun**, as **Ji-Eun Tak**, was perfect in her portrayal of a bubbly girl and her chemistry with Gong Yoo was just perfect. The sad and heartbreaking scenes they shared left me heartbroken for weeks, in fact whenever I think on every rewatch that I will escape the fate of heartbroken; I lose for good. **Lee Dong-Wook** was, however, the real **x-factor** of this drama as the **Grim Reaper/Wang Yeo**. Not just because of his stoic, cold performance, but the synergy between both **him** and **Gong Yoo** was just something else- something more than a couple (IYKYK). Both used situational comedy, as a way to showcase their rivalry turned into friendship, with utmost ease. Because of his performance, **Grim Reaper** turned out to be more than just a 'Second Male lead' trope. **Yoo In-na** was also perfect as **Sunny**. Her scenes with **Dong-Wook**, although funny at times, later turned to be so traumatic and heartbreaking that I had to stop and relax my mind - too raw with perfection. The supporting cast, led by **Yook Sun-Jae**, excellently performed the comedic scenes, which became the tension releasing points of this drama.\n\nThe OST - each and every song were absolute bangers. '**Round and Round**', '**I miss you**', the iconic '**Stay with me**' - there is everything you can ask of. The background music was fantastic, so were the costumes and locations-especially the Quebec scenes, **Grim Reaper**'s tea house and **Goblin**'s house.\n\nOverall, it's a perfect **10/10** for me. The series starts off slowly in it's first two episodes but picks up the pace from the third episode and after that it doesn't look back. My favourite episodes were the two most heartbreaking episodes - **13 and 16**.\n\nP.S : My next 3 reviews will be of **'Strong Woman Bong Soon**' , '**Heale**r' and '**Vincenzo**'.",

    "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed this drama after bingeing it at one go. The first 6-7 episodes were absolutely perfect. The friendship dynamic between the FLs was great to see. Liked almost all the support cast. Even the step mother was warm, kind and fun for a change rather than the typical evil step-mom character. Might get a bit angsty through episode 9-11 although there were some great moments there as well. As for the ending I liked it. It was a happy ending and although I feared it might go the \"you and everything else\" route it didn't. Although would have preferred some more scenes or an extra episode of reconciliation between the friends and the fun dynamic that was present in the first half. Didn't quite get why kim dami's character was hated by a lot of audiences I really liked her. Felt for both the female leads. Overall had a nice time with the drama. I would say if you haven't watched it, go with an open mind without the outside noise and hate , judge for yourself; you might end up liking it. I feel the MDL rating which is 7.4 doesn't really justify this kdrama. Should at least be in the 8's (in my opinion)!",

    "content": "I still can’t understand the logic behind how the writer portrayed that friendship. The female lead harbored feelings for her best friend’s boyfriend  and even after the second lead broke up with him, she stayed friends with him for seven years. Why would anyone want to be with a man who once dated their best friend( mind you, he picked her bsf even though he had the choice to pick the fl.) The fact that she still pursued a man who had been with her best friend after everything that friend had sacrificed for her makes the female lead come off as selfish, not romantic or cute.\n\nThe second female lead, on the other hand, was the heart of the story. She gave everything , her last bit of money, her time, her safety, to protect  her bsf. She covered the FL’s shifts, watched her siblings, and literally risked her life by stabbing a man to defend her. And when she realized her best friend was in love with her boyfriend, she didn’t lash out, she let him go. That’s not weakness, that’s selflessness. \n\nYet the writing rewarded her pain with making her seem like the selfish/jealous one. It felt like the writers could not stand to let her shine. They took everything that made her special, including her Miss Korea dream, her dignity, and her love, and gave it to the female lead just to make her seem more complete. Yes, she won in the end, but it did not feel like a real victory. Miss Korea was her dream from the very beginning, something she wanted for long before anyone else cared. The show treated it like a consolation prize, as if success on stage could erase all the pain she carried. She was the one who held the emotional weight of the story, yet the writers refused to let her have peace or proper recognition.\n\nThe story framed the 2nd fl as the complicated one, but that complexity was what made her human, she wasn't just one dimensional. She was messy, emotional, protective, and fiercely loyal , way more than the fl could ever be.\n\nIt’s frustrating because the second female lead embodied the real heart of A Hundred Million Memories. She was the one who understood love, friendship, and sacrifice , yet the writer treated her like a stepping stone for the FL’s growth. If anything, she deserved the title role. \n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the male lead. The man had the emotional depth of a puddle. He dated one girl, then spent seven years hovering around her best friend. That’s not love, that’s cowardice dressed up as destiny. This is a critique on the writer not an the actors, they all did phenomanol job.",

From what I remember, both the main male and female leads were human, and they ended up in this strange realm or world that they could only enter by falling asleep. I think it involved a campus or school setting where they were there to study. While in this realm, they met other people who became their friends, and then they actually end up comatose in real life, and if someone d!ed there, they’d d!e in real life as well. At some point, it’s revealed that the female lead’s father had created this realm, though I can’t remember how exactly the characters ended up in comas.

    "content": "I loved how his whole arc with the turtle subtly showed his redemption — he was manipulated by Jin Mu, lost his friendship with Jang Uk, and became this lonely, conflicted character. Then Naksu (as Bu-yeon) made him save that little turtle, and suddenly, it felt like he found a reason to hope again.\n\nThe Turtle gave him a flicker of hope — that he could still change, take responsibility, and find his way back to the person he used to be. The turtle became this quiet symbol of redemption, and through it, he slowly healed his friendship with Jang Uk.\n\n His interactions with the turtle were so cute!! He even went against jinmu and made allies with janguk because jinmu took his turtle away😂.\n\n",

    "content": "I started watching Coffee Prince while I am waiting for certain dramas to come out (and I do love Gong Yoo). However, I am on episode 4 and I need to get this off my chest. Why is the female childhood friend essentially playing with 3 men's emotions? I usually do not judge, and I often feel like kdrama fans are overly critical to female characters, but how are these men okay with this situation? I know you have a past together but come on, how is nobody seeing that she is the type that leaves when opportunity arises? How is Gong Yoo's character so down bad? Please tell me someone confronts her about this tendency. Not saying she is a horrible person, but the way the narrative is framed so far is that she is taking them for granted, like extremely.\n\n  \nEdit: Now that I have watched a few more episodes, I would like to say that they are all culpable now. My word, it's the PG version of the movie Savages, I swear.",

I thought this show was more than the usual “love triangle” trope. Unfortunately, the story was minimized to that area, and it ultimately lost its charm.\n\nWhat I loved about this show in the first place is the way it teaches girls to be ambitious, that they are more than their circumstances. It teaches us to stand up not just for ourselves but also for others. Most importantly, it teaches us to fight for our dreams, no matter what.\n\nBut in the second half, the story was reduced to two women pitted against each other over a man.\n\nTruly devastating.\n\nThe ending is still honestly moving but the path it took toward the finish line is rather messy and questionable.\n\nThe writing dimmed the light of this show.\n\nStill, it’s a memory you’d like to remember, at least for the first half only.",

Of course it has tons of issues.

Navigating relationships wheb each party is dealing with their own baggage and blind spots in their knowledge and character can be really rough. \n\nThe \"friends\" still annoyed me. \n\n2nd ml was so hot, it was giving Gong Yoo in coffee prince a bit. \n\nAlso the amount of times I felt bad for the 4 leads, talking to the person who likes them about the person they like.\n\nSide note it was so interesting to see the bright colours for all the cast, lots of white vs in more recent years it's lots of black.\n\n",

A drama may be nominated again for a different category even if it has won earlier.\n\n• The vote grid is designed to capture the community's genuine preferences, but repeated nominations and strategic upvoting introduce bias. This creates an uneven playing field, making it unfair for other participants and their choices. Hence the highest upvoted comment shall be considered in such scenarios.\n\n• It is not possible for me to accommodate a multitude of genres as it would make the grid too big. Once this series is done, I will post another series based on the genres suggested by you all.\n\n• **Please REFRAIN from downvoting. This isn't really a competition. It's just a fun grid. If you dont agree with an opinion, dont upvote it. Down voting opinions will lead to people not giving their true opinion which isn't what this grid activity is about.**\n\nThe winner for **LEGAL** drama that was **UNDERRATED** is **LAW SCHOOL** with **16** votes. \n\n1st runner up is **DIVORCE ATTORNEY SHIN** with **14** votes. \n\n2nd runner up is **ONE DOLLAR LAWYER** with **12** votes.\n\nLink to the previous grid- https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/s/XCQ4HRIzvU\n\nThese are some of the parameters that can be considered for a show to be underrated. However, these are suggestive in nature and not all parameters need to qualify.\n\n**Overrated- Considered to be better than it really is**\n\n• High Popularity Despite Not Having High Quality. The drama has some weak writing or maybe some weak acting or weak production (doesn't need to have all 3 reasons) but it still gained widespread attention. It remains popular even though it deserves less recognition. Dramas that can be nominated are those that either are beloved in both, South Korea as well internationally/online or those that were unsuccessful in South Korea yet popular internationally/online or popular in South Korea yet unsuccessful internationally/online.\n\n• Good Promotion or Marketing. Good advertising or buzz from the network or platform it was streamed on. Many viewers are aware of the drama.\n\n• Overshadowed smaller releases. Released alongside less hyped or less star-studded shows that deserved more popularity.\n\n• It has a star studded cast or popular writer/ director's name attached to it which helped in it's success.\n\n• Dramas that have been nominated for/won awards can also be nominated if YOU found them to be overrated.\n\n• High ratings or viewership stats. It might have been successful with TV ratings in its home country or streaming numbers.\n\n**• Whether a drama is overrated or not is a subjective opinion. It doesn't mean that the drama is bad. It just means that the drama is not as good as it's hype.**\n\n**Please note-**\n\n**This is the third and final grid (for now). If I get enough suggestions, I will make a 4th one. If you have any suggestions for other genres that I might have missed, please write them in the comments. Thank you.**",

The chemistry was clearly there, and I can’t deny that some scenes were visually beautiful and painfully relatable for people who’ve entertained walking red flags. BUT the farther it went, the more it felt like the show got scared to commit to growth or a meaningful message.\n\nWhat really killed it for me was the ending. Knowing the webtoon had a more empowering route, the drama's choice to play it safe just felt like a disservice. Viewers who knew the source material were extra frustrated. Imagine rooting for Nabi’s character development only for her to circle back like nothing was learned. Webtoon &gt; Drama.\n\nOverall, I’d say it had strong potential and great side characters (most people even preferred Bitna and Kyu-hyun’s storyline), but the execution fell flat. It’s one of those shows you watch for vibes, not for satisfaction.",

But today, if you are the type of viewer who really invest a lot of emotions to the plot, structure of the story, character, conflicts, and all, and not just for romance or just to pass a time. Then it's's not worth it of your time. It's a messed up story. (But if you don't mind them, then watch it).\n\nI liked how they messed up the plot in the mid of the series before because I still don't know how they'll wrap all those holes. But seeing it today... I feel lost. \n\nIt feels like they put the uncooked popcorn on a hot pan, and after they pop up, they ignore it and just order a fast food. It's ironic how they use \"Unfinished story\" as a title for the last episode, when they didn't even give enough closure for the main characters. \n\nI'm quite pissed right now because I can literally predict what would happen in the last episode, it become cheap episode for me. \n\nNo effort at all. \n\nThis just proves for the discussion of how many episodes of drama is considered good and bad. Having 12 episodes doesn't mean it have good quality of story, same with 8, 14, 16, or even 20+. \n\nIt will all fall in how excellent the production are to execute the story for that number of episodes.\n\nIn this case, they didn't maximize the potential of this story to be another masterpiece. \n\nIt's sad, frustrating, there's a happy moments too of course, but how they finished it just a disappointment to me. I don't care if it's a &gt;!happy ending!&lt; They messed up this story big time. \n\nThis is just my take though, you can agree and disagree. You can still watch it, and see it for yourself.

Lots of you watched this before watching Nine Puzzles but for me it was actually the opposite. I love all the cast. Amazing acting honestly bravo . Yes there is a lot of exaggeration but not too much . The representation was great. I felt truly seen in that series . Although I’m not diagnosed with ASD , I do have misophonia , ocd,a strong need for routines,predictability,focused interests and other things too. I really felt understood and heard . There should be so many more shows like this . Glad this is getting a season 2  because I’ll be watching for sure . The chemistry is amazing too . \n\nGood casting\n\nGreat storylines \n\nGreat music ( the best background music goes to the Glory then Alchemy souls and then EAW)\n\n",

    "content": "I swear, every time Lee Mi-sook shows up on screen, she just *owns* it — no matter the role.\n\nIn ***Queen of Tears***, she was **Mo Seul-hee**, the woman who clawed her way into the chaebol family’s inner circle — greedy, manipulative, and power-hungry. A mother willing to abandon her own child for money and influence. She played that cold ambition with such elegance that you couldn’t help but be both horrified *and* impressed.\n\nThen in ***Tempest***, she returns as **Lim Ok-seon**, the sharp and calculating chairwoman of a major conglomerate — again commanding every scene with that same quiet authority and menace. It’s like she was *born* to play powerful villains who hide daggers behind polite smiles.\n\nBut what really shows her range is ***Perfect Marriage Revenge***. Here, she flips the script completely — playing **Lee Jung-hye**, a gentle and caring mother figure. She’s soft-spoken, considerate of her children, and even shows kindness toward her stepson. It’s such a refreshing side of her — warm, graceful, and full of quiet strength.",

    "title": "Bothered about some points in Alchemy of souls",
    "content": "Just finished Alchemy of Souls today, and I feel like some things needed to be addressed further \n\n1) Naksu killing Mu Deok. Naksu is considered at one point as this pitiful character who was used and discarded by the Danju, and I believe at some point one of the minor characters even states that Naksu only killed soul shifters or mages, and never harmed ordinary citizens, but she clearly didn't hesitate to have someone die so she could live. It's a bit odd, and feels a bit distant from the character that we see after.\n\n2) How did Naksu get into Mu Deok's body? Master Lee I believe says at some point that Naksu is trapped in that body. What does that mean? Naksu initiated Alchemy of souls with another woman, but ended up shifting with Mu Deok. But Mu Deok wasn't too close to that area at the time. Did Jin Seol Ran/ Jin Bu Yeon purposefully trap Naksu inside? But if so, then why? Mu Deok had already reached Daeho fortress, and with her skills it wouldn't have been too difficult to get back to Jinyowon. Why involve Naksu and complicate things so much more?\n\n3) This might be because I didn't watch carefully enough, but I didn't understand the intensity of the hatred Jang Uk had for the crown prince in the second season. I understand that the crown prince was a grey character for the most part, but I still don't recall him doing anything so wrong to specifically harm Jang Uk or Mu Deok, or was it due to his association to Jinmu?\n\n4) The idea of two souls existing in one body and Naksu's revival. Is it because Jin Seol Ran had always planned to leave? Or because Jin Bu Yeon was never supposed to exist? Or because Jin Bu Yeon's divine powers were so incredible that she could maintain her soul in her body even while Naksu took the wheel? Also, if a body is deceased, isn't the soul automatically supposed to leave? What did they mean by, the body is petrified but kept alive by the power of Naksu's soul??? I feel like Naksu's revival was in large part creative liberty\n\n\n5) This is purely for rant purposes, but why was master Heo's granddaughter so annoying in season two? It's like she borrowed her personality from her maid.   ",

I watched this seeing recommendations on this sub and I'm so so glad I gave it a chance. Post kdrama gloom is hitting me so hard right now😭😭\n\nI just loved everything about this drama, the characters, the OST, the pacing of the story, the cinematography. Not a single boring episode imo and kept me hooked till the end.\nIt was hilarious to watch Yoon Young and Baek Hee Sub's bickering 🤣🤣. I won't give any spoilers about the plot so whoever hasn't watched this yet, please please please do watch it asap.\n\nThis one is similar to 'Twinkling watermelon' (which I had also loved) but definitely more intense and made me cry soooo much. &gt;! Especially her dad's story made me a crying mess. Just thinking about it makes my heart hurt😭😭!&lt;\n\nSo anybody else who loved this drama a lot? Please recommend other similar, underrated, heart-touching dramas for me to watch to get over this 😭😭😭",

    "content": "I tagged this as spoiler, so I'm not going to bother with spoiler text in here. If you haven't watched the series yet, don't keep reading!!\n\nAll 12 episodes of **Confidence Queen** are out now (it's on Prime in the States). I finished it last night, and wow, I *loved* it! 😍 I might be biased because Park Min Young is my favorite, but even if another actress had been cast, I would have loved it too. It was just fun, frothy, and hilarious. Yes, there was past trauma and even a childhood connection, but I didn't hate that. The flashbacks to her captivity were super creepy!! I think the only thing that would have made me love it more would have been if I'd waited to watch it until all episodes had dropped. Turns out I am not a fan of watching in real-time. I want to binge!! Also, I really shipped Yi Rang and Gu Ho - at least for a hookup. Maybe next season?? 🤞\n\nHere are the things I personally loved about it:\n\n- The guest stars!!!! 🤩 Right there in episode 1, you get Lee Bong Ryun and Song Ji Hyo. When Lee Yi Kyung showed up later on, I absolutely *died*. And then my other favorite, Kim Sun Young?? Amazing! They had Rowoon, Ha Joon, and others I probably don't recognize yet, but you guys would.\n- The disguises! James was probably my favorite disguise-wise - his were pretty hilarious. The whole Joseon-era story they acted out in one episode had great costumes. Both Park Hee Soon and Joo Jong Hyuk look really good with facial hair.\n- Taking down the bad guys! I loooove it when the good guys are two steps ahead of the bad guys - the finale had the best use of this, imo. I know the trio are con artists and they take money from their marks, so they're not like *good* good guys, but they only target bad people.\n- When PMY turned to the camera in the end credits and said, \"Confidence Queen will be back.\" Hell yeah!! Can't wait.\n\nWhat did you guys think about it?",

    "content": "***A Time Called You*** that drama that tells a heartbreaking yet beautiful story about love, loss, and fate. It starts with **Han Jun Hee**, a woman who is unable to move on after losing her boyfriend, **Yeon Jun**, in a tragic accident. One day, she suddenly finds herself mysteriously transported back in time to the year **1998**, where she wakes up in the body of a high school girl named **Kwon Min Ju**. There, she meets **Nam Si Heon**, a boy who looks exactly like her late boyfriend, and his best friend **Jung In Gyu**, who secretly loves Min Ju.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Jun Hee realizes that the events in the past are somehow connected to her present. She tries to figure out why she has gone back in time and how she can save the people she cares about from the tragedies that keep repeating. But the more she learns, the more painful the truth becomes. The drama mixes **romance, mystery, and time travel**, showing how love can exist beyond time, even when fate seems to pull people apart.\n\nIt’s a very emotional story full of **twists, memories, and heartbreak** that makes you think about how powerful love can be, and how sometimes, even when people are separated by time or death, their hearts can still find each other again.\n\nLiterally my favorite till now..\n\nWHAT DID YOU LIKE THE MOST ABOUT THIS DRAMA AND THER ACTING ??",

    "title": "Why Lee Suho Was the Real True Beauty / Right Choice (and Why Seojun Was Never the Right Choice)",
    "content": "Let’s conclude the True Beauty debate on who really deserved the girl. For me, it was Lee Suho from beginning to end. I know some people disagree, but I’m going to explain why Seojun was never the right choice and why he was always meant to be the second lead. So, stick with me cause this is a long one, but I need to get my point across. I’ve been rewatching a lot of K-dramas lately because the new ones have been kind of disappointing, and while rewatching True Beauty, I realized how strongly I still feel about this.\n\nThe first thing that completely turned me toward Suho was the reason Seojun started pursuing Jugyeong in the first place. He only went after her because he wanted to stop her from falling in love with Suho. That was his whole motivation. So if she had actually fallen for him while he didn’t have real feelings yet, she would’ve been the one to get hurt, all because of a grudge he had with Suho. To me, that was selfish. The fact that he ended up falling for her later felt like his punishment, or karma, for trying to play with someone’s feelings. He caught feelings himself, and yeah, it made him more human, but it didn’t make him the right one for her.\n\nAnd I get why people love Seojun. He was loyal, caring, funny, and his friendship with Jugyeong was cute, but being a good person doesn’t automatically make you the right match. People just love the bad boy type so much that it blinded them to what True Beauty was actually about. They missed the whole point.\n\nSuho, on the other hand, didn’t need to chase her or play games. He liked her before everyone else did, before the makeup and the glow-up, when she was still hiding behind insecurity. He saw her exactly as she was and cared for her in a quiet but genuine way. That’s what made his love real. It wasn’t loud or dramatic, but it was honest. That’s the kind of love that stays.\n\nA lot of Seojun fans use the argument that Suho left her when he went abroad and say that’s why he didn’t deserve her. But you have to look at it from Suho’s perspective. They were teenagers. His dad was sick, he was dealing with guilt and trauma from his friend’s death, and he wasn’t in a good place emotionally. They were still together long-distance for a while, but after a few years of his dad not getting better, he felt bad for holding her back. He didn’t want to make her wait for him endlessly while he couldn’t even be there for her. So he let her go.\n\nTo me, that wasn’t abandonment, that was sacrifice. He was thinking about her happiness, not his own. He left because he loved her enough to let her move forward with her life. By the time he came back, she had finished high school, graduated college, and was already years into her career. That’s a long time. More than five years had passed. He made the hard, mature decision to let her go when he couldn’t give her what she deserved.\n\nPeople say Seojun “stayed,” but presence doesn’t always mean understanding. Suho understood Jugyeong better than anyone else. He saw her insecurities, her pain, her real self, and still loved her through all of it. So yes, Seojun loved her passionately, but Suho loved her right.\n\nAt the end of the day, True Beauty wasn’t about choosing the louder love, it was about choosing the love that saw you completely and unconditionally. That’s why, no matter how many times I rewatch it, it’s always going to be Suho for me.",

Coming from an idol background, she suited the role of Gong Shim perfectly. Namgoong Min, as always, delivered well. He’s such a versatile actor who can bring life to different roles. The playful banter between the leads in the beginning was so cute and fun to watch.\n\nHowever, as the story went on, it shifted into a more serious tone, which felt quite different from how it started. The pacing became a bit dragging, and the drama seemed to lose the charm of its original setup. Eventually, I found myself less interested, and I honestly felt a bit regretful about how the story turned out. Still, the cast did well, and the early episodes were definitely enjoyable.",

Her acting felt real like when she was betrayed , the feeling of revenge felt real . And would like to appreciate Na In woo , he is an amazing actor in my opinion .

His acting was insane. I first saw him in “At a Distance, Spring Is Green” and really liked his character there, but this was on a completely different level. Im in shock at how amazing his acting is. \n\nSo, question: Should I watch season 2? Or should I wait until they announce a season 3…. 😭😭😭😭 \n",

    "content": "so w korea has recently held the 'love your w 2025' event which is supposed to be a breast cancer awareness campaign event.  w korea and the celebrity attendees (a mix of actors and kpop idols) are being criticized. \n\nw korea is being criticized because the event barely mentioned breast cancer. the pink ribbons, a global symbol for breast cancer awareness was not present. also people are questioning the fact that this event has been hosted for twenty years, and only 1.1 billion korean has been raised. that's roughly $774,000 in usd. that means the event raises less than $40,000 each year. people are saying the amount is suspicious and some are speculating potential money laundering because of small amount that's being fundraised per year.\n\njay park is being criticized for performing one of his songs that sexualizes woman's bodies. one lyric mentions woman's breasts, people are saying that is tone deaf and inappropriate to perform at an event about breast cancer awareness.\n\ncelebrity attendees are being criticized for not wearing a pink to show support for breast cancer awarenes. they are also being criticized for not mentioning what the event is fundraising for. i believe three idols mentioned breast cancer awareness.  attendees for the event are also being criticized for partying at the event. there were videos posted online of various attendees drinking, dancing, and singing. people are criticizing them, saying it was inappropriate for them to treat a fundraising event as an after party.\n\nhere is a rough list of actors that were at the event:\n\nwon ji an, lee dong hwi, lee min ho, lee soo hyuk, lee young ae, lee yoo mi, lee joon hyuk, lee jun ho, lee chae min, im soo jung, im ji yeon, choo young woo, krystal, go soo, go hyun jung, gong myung, kim min ha, kim se jeong, kim young kwang, kim young dae, kim ji seok, noh sang hyun, noh jeong eui, moon so ri, park gyu young, park eun bin, byeon woo seok, jeon yeo been, jung ryeo won\n\nwhat do you think about w korea and the celebrity. attendees getting criticized? i personally think most of the criticism should go towards w korea since they're the ones hosting the event. they did not host the event like it was a fundraising event. but i do think it is tone deaf and inappropriate for the celebrity attendees to treat a fundraising event like an after party. like the bare minimum should be wearing pink ribbons.

Like saying goodbye to people who understood me more than most real ones do.\nI kept wishing for a Season 2, but maybe part of its magic is that it ended when it needed to. Not everything broken needs a sequel — some things just… end beautifully.\nI don’t know, man. It healed something in me I didn’t know was bleeding.\nAnd now I just miss them all.",

    "content": "From the trailer and poster. This screamed that it was gonna be right up my alley. This is one of those dramas that does have a plot, but it’s much more character-driven. This is my first drama with Chun Woo Lee, realised I had seen her in Unlocked, and that was good. I think Song Joon Ki is good as well in this. Sometimes his character did fall a little flat, but it wasn’t destroying the show.\n\nI loved the flower shop. Cozy and a really nice hub for all the characters. The big flaw is that I don’t think I saw more than 2 people buy flowers from\nThis shop, how is it still running?\n\nThe main flaw with this drama is that I didn’t feel that “Spark” between the leads. Both great actors, and I felt it with their younger counterparts. I just think that the casting was a little off on that front. The cinematography is really beautiful when it wants to be. Other times it’s a little bland. The side couple was entertaining, and I actually prefer their arc to the main leads a little. \n\nThe intro to this show is so comforting, too. I hope it isn’t AI because I love the art and the colours. Didn’t skip it once.\n\nEpisodes 2 and 10 were the standout episodes for me. The backstory in 2 was done really well, and I found myself invested. The cinematography was at its best here. 10 just felt like I was watching a random episode of The Truman Show, and I liked that. Not a whole lot happened.\n\nOverall, this is a nice show. Nothing spectacular. FL is great, ML is fine, side characters are charming. 7.5-8/10 for me. If you’ve watched a lot of melodramas recently. Do not bother. I know what it’s like to be tired of a genre (hospital dramas). Go watch something else, and when it’s a rainy couple of days and you have nothing to do. Put this on.\n",

The music, the songs, the choreography, the cinematography, the effects, and the story, which was really poignant. I didn't guess they were going to go that way with the story, but it made perfect sense: considering that you are watching a fantasy. It's unlike any other kdrama I've seen, not that I've seen that many.\n\nIt's only six episodes, which is unusually short for a kdrama but just the perfect size for this story. It's not an all-singing, all-dancing musical; most of the songs are 'expressing my feelings' and are soft.\n\nI'm not sure who came up with the English title The Sound of Magic. The original Korean title is the Korean equivalent of abracadabra, which is said throughout the film. Maybe to emphasize there's music?\n\nAnyway, this is definitely on my rewatch list. And there is no need to read any \"ending explained\" articles or videos. The ending was perfect. And if you rewatch, the lyrics for the Magician are spot-on.\n\nI still can't get over how perfect this was.

    "content": "I apologise for the confusion caused yesterday! It's not a good idea to make the post when you wake up from a nap 😅\n\nPlease read this-\n\n• You can only cast your votes for the genre and label stated in the title and the highest voted drama shall be displayed in the corresponding box the next day.\n\n• Some dramas are multi genre so repetition is allowed as opinions are subjective. A drama may be nominated again for a different category even if it has won earlier.\n\n• The vote grid is designed to capture the community's genuine preferences, but repeated nominations and strategic upvoting introduce bias. This creates an uneven playing field, making it unfair for other participants and their choices. Hence the highest upvoted comment shall be considered in such scenarios.\n\n• It is not possible for me to accommodate a multitude of genres as it would make the grid too big. Once this series is done, I will post another series based on the genres suggested by you all.\n\n• **Please REFRAIN from downvoting. This isn't really a competition. It's just a fun grid. If you dont agree with an opinion, dont upvote it. Down voting opinions will lead to people not giving their true opinion which isn't what this grid activity is about.**\n\nThe winner for **MELODRAMA/ TRAGIC** drama that was **UNDERRATED** is **THE SMILE HAS LEFT YOUR EYES** with **9** votes. \n\n1st runner up is **HI BYE, MAMA!** with **6** votes. \n\n2nd runner up is **NAVILLERA** with **5** votes.\n\nLink to the previous grid- https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/s/6KcHQEdveX\n\nThese are some of the parameters that can be considered for a show to be underrated. However, these are suggestive in nature and not all parameters need to qualify.\n\n• Low Popularity Despite High Quality The drama has strong writing, acting, and production but didn't gain widespread attention. It remains under the radar even though it deserves more recognition.\n\n• Minimal Promotion or Marketing Without much advertising or buzz from the network or platform, the drama went unnoticed. Many viewers simply never heard about it.\n\n• Overshadowed by Bigger Releases Released alongside more hyped or star-studded shows, it got overlooked. Timing often affects visibility regardless of quality.\n\n• Niche or Unconventional Storytelling The plot may be artistic, slow-paced, or offbeat, which limits its appeal to mainstream audiences. It connects deeply with a small audience instead.\n\n• Strong Word-of-Mouth but Small Audience Those who watch it highly recommend it, but the viewer base remains limited. It slowly builds a loyal following over time.\n\n• Low ratings or viewership stats It might have struggled with TV ratings or streaming numbers, especially in its home country. These metrics can mislead audiences into thinking it's not worth watching\n\n**Please note-**\n\n**This is the third and final grid (for now). If I get enough suggestions, I will make a 4th one. If you have any suggestions for other genres that I might have missed, please write them in the comments. Thank you.** ",

And that says a lot, because I *always* finish dramas once I start. I usually soldier through, even if they suck—mostly because I enjoy listening to and trying to learn Korean.\n\nWith most popular dramas, I get hooked within the first few episodes. But with these two, I was literally forcing myself to keep watching... and I still couldn’t do it. I just don’t find them engaging for some reason. Is it the FL, SHK? The only other drama I’ve seen her in is *Full House*, and I only watched that because I love Rain. That one was weird too, but I stuck it out for him.\n\nIt’s so strange because people LOVE these dramas—especially *Empire of the Sun*. It’s so popular that other dramas reference that scarf scene all the time. I hate leaving dramas unfinished in my watchlist, but I just can’t get myself to go back to these.\n\nAm I the only one?\n\nEdit: I only even started encounter to see P.O.

How wrong was i, I'm only on episode 4 and can see this is going to be a 10/10 i absolutely love it. The FL really reminds me of the FL in \"my love from a star\" which i one of my favourite dramas. How i know I'm going to love this as well is i haven't been on here for a while i didn't feel the need to express how much i loving a show or ask for shows just like that. I have watched the king's affection and our unwritten seoul and about 3 others! As much as I liked them none of them gave me that feeling i used to get watching kdramas, that was until this. It gives me everything i love in a drama! Love, laughter, intrigue, a little bit of historical history and most of all, a drama which its not just about the FL and ML i love all the characters! I really wish I'd watched this sooner.\nHere's the rest of what i've watched so far (what i can remember anyway) looking at my taste what do you recommend next, apart from (abyss) i only watched 10 minutes but I really got into it and will probably watch that after!

He's also her *father*! Likelihood he believes her is low, but not none, and with the level of suspending belief we have to do in this show I think it'd be fair to assume we could have gotten a scene where she confides in him after he comes home from getting groceries (after her reading the page again fails) and finds her upset where she confides in him about it. \n\nAt that point it would be reasonable for him to believe it, and I wanted to get to see at least a small bit of that conversation! Or of her introducing *THE TYRANT KING* to her Dad and having him totally geek out over him and start bombarding him with questions!\n\nWithout having this part it feels like her Dad was made a historian just for plot magic and her to have a reasonable reason to have so much knowledge of the Joeson era. \n\nHer Dad gets no love and is used for like 2 scenes in the whole show and I wanted at least 1 more where I got to see SOME character in him of the characterization we were told and not shown and it makes me sad damnit!\n\nEdit: Didn't realize I didn't put the full name in the title so I adjusted the first sentence to have it.

Like, the concept of a supernatural being trying to understand human emotions and getting involved in people’s lives—it’s pretty similar. Even the dynamic between the genie and the female lead feels like how Lucifer and Chloe balanced each other out, one being all-powerful but emotionally clueless, and the other being human but strong in her own way. The mix of fantasy, romance, and mystery also kinda matches Lucifer’s tone. Of course, it still has that typical K-drama charm with more emotion and depth, but I can’t help noticing the resemblance. What about you guys? Do you see the same connection or is it just me overthinking?\n",

Fashion brands pay the event organisers to have stars wear their clothes — that’s how these events generate funds and attention. It’s the same thing that happens during fashion weeks and red carpets everywhere. The gala served its purpose: it brought together big names, high fashion, and money for a cause.\n\nAs far as I know, this is how celebrity charity galas work worldwide. I’m not able to see what went so horribly wrong. This post isn’t an attack to the criticism so if there is an actual point where something was done with bad taste, I want to know about it! ",

    "content": "Please read this-\n\n• You can only cast your votes for the genre and label stated in the title and the highest voted drama shall be displayed in the corresponding box the next day.\n\n• Some dramas are multi genre so repetition is allowed as opinions are subjective. A drama may be nominated again for a different category even if it has won earlier.\n\n• The vote grid is designed to capture the community's genuine preferences, but repeated nominations and strategic upvoting introduce bias. This creates an uneven playing field, making it unfair for other participants and their choices. Hence the highest upvoted comment shall be considered in such scenarios.\n\n• It is not possible for me to accommodate a multitude of genres as it would make the grid too big. Once this series is done, I will post another series based on the genres suggested by you all.\n\n• **Please REFRAIN from downvoting. This isn't really a competition. It's just a fun grid. If you dont agree with an opinion, dont upvote it. Down voting opinions will lead to people not giving their true opinion which isn't what this grid activity is about.**\n\nThe winner for **COMEDY** drama that was **UNDERRATED** is **SEOUL BUSTERS** with **32** votes. \n\n1st runner up is **GAUS ELECTRONICS** with **27** votes. \n\n2nd runner up is **THE SOUND OF YOUR HEART** with **19** votes.\n\nLink to the previous grid- https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/s/UHvpWioX9R\n\nThese are some of the parameters that can be considered for a show to be underrated. However, these are suggestive in nature and not all parameters need to qualify.\n\n• Low Popularity Despite High Quality The drama has strong writing, acting, and production but didn't gain widespread attention. It remains under the radar even though it deserves more recognition.\n\n• Minimal Promotion or Marketing Without much advertising or buzz from the network or platform, the drama went unnoticed. Many viewers simply never heard about it.\n\n• Overshadowed by Bigger Releases Released alongside more hyped or star-studded shows, it got overlooked. Timing often affects visibility regardless of quality.\n\n• Niche or Unconventional Storytelling The plot may be artistic, slow-paced, or offbeat, which limits its appeal to mainstream audiences. It connects deeply with a small audience instead.\n\n• Strong Word-of-Mouth but Small Audience Those who watch it highly recommend it, but the viewer base remains limited. It slowly builds a loyal following over time.\n\n• Low ratings or viewership stats It might have struggled with TV ratings or streaming numbers, especially in its home country. These metrics can mislead audiences into thinking it's not worth watching\n\n**Please note-**\n\n**This is the third and final grid (for now). If I get enough suggestions, I will make a 4th one. If you have any suggestions for other genres that I might have missed, please write them in the comments. Thank you.**\n",

The idea is creative and gives a fresh take on love and identity. The show beautifully shows how love is more about connection and understanding than looks. Seo Hyun-jin does a great job showing emotions through her changing identity, and the chemistry between the leads feels natural. However, some parts feel slow and a few side stories don’t add much to the main plot. Still, it’s a comforting drama with a warm message that real beauty lies within. It may not be perfect, but it leaves you thinking about what truly makes someone special.",

Something like **legal high, while you were sleeping, reborn rich, Vincenzo, law school, suspicious partner** etc. I call them “quirky legal dramas” lol. \n\nI’ve also already watched **I hear your voice, lawless lawyer, law cafe, witch at court, may it please the court, military prosecutor Doberman, extraordinary attorney woo, the girl who sees scents and one dollar lawyer**\n\nI’m in a bad mood and want something to lift my mood, so if you can’t think of any other legal dramas it doesn’t have to be strictly legal. But something with the same kind of vibe as these shows would be great, as long as it’s funny. And please no historical things. I’ve also already watched **love to hate you and welcome to Waikiki** and I’m not open to **beyond the bar**. Thanks in advance! ",

I'm currently a college student studying writing (story-writing, composition, etc.) I'm practicing analyzing and writing reviews for tv shows so my first for this Reddit page will be: *Beyond the Bar*.\n\nI'm open to any constructive criticism you may have, whether it's for my writing style, content, or even opinion--I'm posting this here to get feedback ♥\n\n\\------  \n*Beyond the Bar* started off with an original and strong premise revolving around two lawyers' growth as they overcome several legal obstacles through wit and determination. It defied the rom-com trend with a fresh perspective on mentorship, academia, and friendship in a courtroom drama. Halfway through the show, however, the focus shifts and trades its strongest features for a lackluster romance between two side characters. The main characters' journeys, dynamics, and courtroom battles that once built this show are reduced to forced and cliche subplots. While romance at many times can strengthen the plot--here, it feels tacked on and completely disconnected from the overarching drama's development. If the writers had balanced screentime, woven the side romance to the larger plot, and kept the focus on the legal battles, *Beyond the Bar* would've held strong as an original and entertaining K-drama, fit for a coveted spot on the S-tier.\n\nEDIT: I just realized I should've written the part about romance more clearly! I'm criticizing the romance between the two side characters because they got more screentime. Their romance didn't contribute to the main plot or legal premise either.",

Like if they just made a few different decisions around characters or the plot, it would have drastically improved it?\n\nBecause of recency bias, Destined With You feels like a half fleshed out story with not a strong defined chemistry between the leads and average to mediocre acting. I didn’t find the modern romance part to be anything out of the ordinary and if anything was subpar to other similar dramas. To me, their past lives and intertwined fates along with the spell book was the interesting part and stood out but sadly not explored enough. \n\nAlso it really felt like I was watching two different kdramas when watching their modern lives vs past lives. The actors even did a better job acting with a lot more emotional depth and conviction in their past lives than they did the entire drama. Idk maybe they fit historical period dramas better like Rowoon in The King’s Affection. Who knows but it just feels wasted. ",

(**박기세** 역 배우 캐스팅은 별로였지만) **박기세**의 잘못이라는 게 **너무나 명백했잖아요.** 해고 지시는 박기세의 스태프에게서 온 것이고, 소백호는 그저 당시 인사과(HR) 담당자였을 뿐이니 상사가 시키는 대로 할 수밖에 없었고요. 게다가 그녀가 박기세에게 받은 고통을 회상하는 장면이 여러 번 나오는데도, 박기세가 전화하면 아무 일 없었다는 듯이 나타나는 걸 보면, 박기세에게 **전혀 화를 낸 적이 없는 것 같아요.**",

The plot lost me around ep 8 and I ff the rest just for these two, they’re sooo cute together!! Their chemistry was everything in this drama, it felt soo real. They might replace hometown chacha couple for me lol, and I absolutely loved chief hong and dr.Yoon.\n\n\nAnyway can someone recommend more dramas of Lee JeHoon where he’s lovey-dovey? I have signal and taxi driver on my list but I don’t think it’s the same genre😅",
