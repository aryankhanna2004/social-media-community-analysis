Is his sales in the toilet like what happened with Li Jiawei? In 5 years, he's only done 2 mini albums. I just came across Wang Heye's red colored album and it's like 15 songs plus some footage of his huge concerts. I loved Cao's 2 minis a crap ton and even all the covers he's done.",

I wouldn't say I'm too well versed in the world of Cpop and id love to be, if anyone can give a sort of brief history of this amazing genre and also good recs. I usually listen to the mainstream ones like Faye Wong, who i absolutely love, little bit of teresea teng, jackie cheung, Andy lau, anita mui, though I'd love to listen to her more. Is jay chou any good, I've heard a lot of conflicting opinions about him. Kelly chen is someone else who I like, but I've only listened to like 2 songs of her. I feel like I've sort of touched upon the breadth of Cpop, but there's so much depth, and falling down this rabbit hole is annoying because i cannot keep track of all the artists, especially the not so well known ones. So if anyone has good knowledge about this genre is like your input.\nThanks in advance!!:)",

This robot-like background track also plays in between Yu's choruses as well. \n\nI'm sorry if I sound confusing, but I really missed this one song of his.

And will continued to be listened to, at least by me. \n\nKhalil Fong has gotten me through so many moments of my life. He has reminded me about the preciousness of the smallest moments and connected me with my Chinese culture in the gentlest ways. He reminded me at we can be introspective about our mixing of cultures in a kind and artistic way. He improved my understanding of the Chinese language with his lyrics. He created a bridge from the US to China through his mixing of styles and languages in his music. \n\nI hear him in other artists music now too- Laufey and Mitski in particular comes to mind. He mixed soul and jazz and pop with love, much like they do. \n\nI will miss him dearly but it gives me comfort that he is still here in his music. He was gone way too soon. \n\nWe will carry him in our hearts and our playlists.\n\nDeepest condolences,\nA fan. ",

It's a female artist in a red dress in a flower field. The only English words I think i heard in the song were \"you're my angel\" if that helps at all. I don't know the name of the song or artist. Unfortunately I had it recorded on a vhs tape along with many other older mvs (including H.o.t. Videos) that is long gone. I would really appreciate the help so I can hear this song again.",

Off first listen, overall, (despite not quite knowing what exactly he's saying) I think he's a solid artist. \n\nWhat do yall think of skai isyourgod though? Do yall like his music?

The issue is, I don’t remember the melody, only a few details from the performance.\n\nIt had an edgy sound and concept (undead theme I think, but I could be wrong). I think the stage was decorated with branches and cobwebs. There were around 5-6 girls. And most significantly, one girl would bend backwards in a c shape at a pivotal part of the song. I drew a picture of it to illustrate the idea better.\n\nAny suggestions or help is appreciated. I’m new to the genre of c-pop but I seriously cannot get the memory of that song out of my head! Also sorry if my short description is unhelpful, I am desperate.\n\nThank you!",

    "title": "A discussion on the \"lack of innovation and change\" in Chinese music",
    "content": "This is an issue among ALL music fans, but I want to focus on Chinese music.\n\nEvery complaint I see always begins with \"I grew up listening to\", and I think this is where the problems comes from. Often it's not because there's a lack of innovation and change in Chinese music, but the person refuses to innovate or change their music taste. So when you've been listening to the same music for 20 years, it's going to sound the same. For me, the music I listened to 5 years ago, is not the same music I listen to today. I'm not asking everyone to become a bunch of hipsters and stop listening to mainstream music, because I also enjoy mainstream music as well.\n\nCpop benefits from various things. It is not monopolized by a single industry, or caters to a foreign market. This allows cpop to be much more fluid in it's definition, and range from folks songs to EDM. Obviously the two main subgroups are mandopop and cantopop, but these genres are define by language. Not all mandopop is by Han people, and not all cantopop is from Hong Kong. If you're able to make it over the mainstream hill, the possibilities of Chinese music is endless.\n\nChina has 23 provinces, and 56 ethnic groups, making the country really diverse. There are dozens of subgroups within ethnicities. There's hundreds of languages, and even more dialects. A few years ago, Uyghur music from Xinjiang was popular due to Rap of China. As of late, Yi music has been popular due to Douyin. Here's a way to spice up your playlist.\n\n* If you listen to one ethnic group a day, that's enough content for almost 2 months\n* If you listen to one ethnic group a week, that's enough content for over 1 year\n* If you listen to one ethnic group a month, that's enough content for almost 5 years\n\nHere are some recommendations. They incorporate folk culture, and some include afrobeat and electronics.\n\n* Wa: [阿拉松 - 尼成NICHENG](https://youtu.be/b_N3l2ymCTw?si=7l9aQ361YF8gLpm7)\n* Miao: [天生傲鼓 - 阿朵Aduo](https://youtu.be/HwlP4lfgZN4?si=u5i9K25RkZpfs5xd)\n* Yi: [阿诗玛 - 莫色Moseee](https://youtu.be/xPNpXRqsBFI?si=gJODmBFXxJbMuzVl)\n* Mongolian: [醒 (完整版) - Mikann耙耙柑](https://youtu.be/gjAdWrCbQaA?si=qeBj5NulbrXJFk87)\n* Naxi: [阿卡巴拉 - 凌西](https://youtu.be/T86NbYi1Lr8?si=JJnzxTONzjw0OaEp)\n\nObviously we can extend this conversation into how do we define Chinese, the modern history of mainland China, the influence of social media, and more. However, I feel like as individuals we still need to take a level of responsibility. We can't complain about a lack of innovation, while refusing to listen to anything different.",

The only word I can remember is \"iPhone 6\" and I think the song was about how the man thinks his girlfriend has too expensive taste (this is just a shot in the dark). The name of the duo had the character 大 or 小 in their name (I can't remember which one anymore but it was one of those two) and their name was short (only two or three characters). The song might be from 2014-2016.\n\nThanks in advance.  \n",

Unfortunately I don’t have the year in which she took part in the competition. If my memory is to be trusted, she made it at least to the top 3 (perhaps maybe second place).  \nShe was quite young and had an incredible voice!\n\nThe song I am trying to find and that I first heard of in 2016, I remember the music video to be very artistic and the singer was dressed in those avant-garde fashion clothes (à la Comme Des Garçons kind of clothes).  \nThe visuals of the music video were quite colorful, with flowers and all.  \n\nThe music itself is pop, on the more upbeat side of pop, NOT ballad or anything. \n\nI think her management/agency at the time was trying to market her as the “next” Faye Wong. \n\nThank you everyone!",

The only clear thing I remember is that is was a hit around 90's and 00's. It was a slow paced love song. It includes the word fan le repeated like: fan le fan le. I even asked gpt to help find the song without any results. Hope you can hit me up with suggestions. Thank you",

(this is so hard…\n\nI've checked YouTube, Bilibili, and even found a few of his japanese, korean, french, and thai fan blogs but many early recordings seem lost and the links just weren’t working. \n\nI’m not an IT expert, had a lot of trouble with broken links and damaged original files. I know old files r hard to restore but if anyone would give me any ideas on how to restore original files on dead sites that would be very much appreciated!!! and if any old fans of DT would kindly share any (ANY) resource of his, will be very very very grateful TVTTT \n\nany help will be greatly appreciated !!!

As far as I know, the album was released in Taiwan but was available on digital platforms for a while. However, since they are Chinese platforms, I can't access them, and I'm not sure if it's still available. \n\nIf anyone knows anything or even knows any of the songs, it would be a great help. It's not an album that was well-known or did well, so I know it's hard to find.  \nI found the album on xlebbs, but it's behind a paywall, and I don't have a payment method since I'm not Chinese.\n\n  \nThank you so much!",

I get that her artistic style, at least on Singer, isn't super mainstream, but that doesn't justify the amount of vitriolic hate she's getting, especially when she's been ranking pretty high on the show.

    "content": "As the title says. I think it would be cool to ask the sub what songs they would add to a hypothetical summer road trip playlist. Limiting people to 2 entries MAX. What songs are you adding? \n\nMine are: \n\n[Super Star by S.H.E](https://youtu.be/gr5fNKK2FaA?si=tC4bBVXnXvpdUrFB) - every road trip needs a few good karaoke songs, it was hard to choose but this is mine\n\n[恐怖的房子 by Supermarket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9rZgNf_yaw) - the rhythmic beat, sustained guitar and tasteful electronic elements, it just feels like it'd be such a vibe when driving down long highways as the sun sets\n\n\nSide note...if this gets good engagement maybe this can be a silly, reoccuring discussion with different playlist themes.

    "title": "A new but excellent music app for IOS, Demus",
    "content": "I found this new music app (for IOS) recommended by somebody on Instagram called Demus (the app icon is a duck? goose? wearing headphones)  \n[https://demus.app/](https://demus.app/) &lt; Website here  \nNo ads interrupt your music, there are only banner ads and you can watch a video ad to unlock Premium for 24 hours.  \n  \nBut the free version is amazing. You can import your playlists from YouTube Music, Spotify and Musi, which in my experience (I imported from YouTube music) was perfect. From what I understand it compiles music from a bunch of different platforms (perfect for those weird artists where some songs are only on certain platforms, or if you want live versions too). \n\nUnlike Spotify's free plan, you have as many skips as you like and the ability to pick which songs to play instead of randomly shuffling through a playlist. And compared to YouTube Music's free plan, the free version of Demus supports background play.\n\nThe lyric function is also better. Unlike other apps which may only grab lyrics from a select few platforms like say, Musixmatch, if Demus cannot find lyrics, it automatically opens a tab in the app with search results related to the song's lyrics with the hopes you can find it there. The website claims that it does a recap like most popular music sites (I cannot confirm the efficacy of this function yet)\n\nNo account needed, but this also means you can't follow artists. Instead, artists saved in your playlists are added to the artist tab in the app. I don't think you can like songs either, but the website says you can bookmark them which serves the same purpose. Another con is that it takes a while to load sometimes (maybe not perfectly optimized just yet).\n\nI'm not being paid to promote or anything I just think it's a cool app, and the minimal invasiveness of the ads is a great concept. I won't be giving up my YouTube Music for this. I just want to share this app with more people. Maybe some of you will like it.",

I tried instead to get it on my Android since I don't really care what happens to it, since I have no personal stuff on it. But there's no Android version on the site, do I tried to download the apk instead through baidu and it doesn't work! I keep getting the message \"请前往Google Play下载应用/Please go to Google Play to download the app\" It's not available on Google Play what do you mean!! I tried to get both QQ Music or Kugou and it didn't work, I even used a VPN and still can't get it.. what do I do??\n\nEdit: more information to add. When I went to the Kugou site using a VPN on android, it sent me to a site saying \"Download via third-party browser\" and \"Download via app store\" it sent me an apk file to download. Would it be safe?",

    "content": "Honestly, I’m really curious to hear other people’s thoughts on why Bilibili’s music community’s might be so toxic and critical (it’s no longer just constructive criticism, but rather pure hatred), that being with its comments section, bullet comments, or even videos themselves that often get the most views. Is it an age / maturity issue, or do people on the platform, especially within the music community, just lack any sort of human decency for others (singers). (Don’t get me started on the number of bilibili short videos where people will literally get hit by a car and the comments will be cheering on their deaths (some 4chan level stuff)).\n\nIt’s kind of ridiculous how people can be so black and white with their music opinions, either saying just 好听 or 难听 to a song / performer, and now the new variations (唱得像史，不豪庭, etc.) that just are so off-putting (真的好阴阳怪气）. People also love to praise one artist while putting down another (踩一捧一）, which only just sparks even more arguments among people in the comments (and stuff like this is literally under EVERY video). \n\nIs there a reason why the Chinese music audience loves to put down its artists to the point where no one’s willing to explore new genres of music that might actually finally spark some industry wide innovation (not just ‘unique’ artists being forced to stay underground)? As an American (ABC), I’ve seen my fair share of toxicity in the western music community, but people typically don’t just spew outright harassment / hatred toward an artist unless they’ve like killed someone or something (Chinese singers look like angels compared to some artists here in the US). \n\nI really hate having to rant, but this has really just been bothering me so much recently cause I really do like using Bilibili for its Chinese content (as a Chinese American trying to connect culturally with China more), but the lack of positivity and supportiveness on the platform (its literally everywhere to the point where any music related video has controversy) makes it really difficult to like Chinese society and its internet.\n\nWeibo and Xiaohongshu are whole other stories too lmao…",

Seeing how the market is nowadays compared to the era of jeff chang faye wong andy lau and jay chou zchen christine fan and after to today I cannot help but feel that as time goes by there seems to be lesser and lesser big names and even the big ones feels like not much and most are about the song than the artist which that too feels little. In the past I can think of so many big artist and even those small ones seems to be to some extent exposed enough just maybe quite forgettable but nowadays it feels that the market is still mainly dominated by the past big names and even for them their work has deteriorated as a whole and even when I said songs are the key thing now it still feels like there are not many songs that I can think of that are big like what song are actually big besides those less than 5 top songs.",

However, the app allows itself to be added to HomeKit, and the only way I can play a song via Airplay is if I choose directly from the HomeKit app, but it is limited to just that one song. The moment I clicked onto the Qq app for my own playlist, all the sound that was streamed via Airplay just stopped working. The weird thing is, Airplay works just fine when I use the Qq app and stream from my laptop. I'm pretty much very confused and frustrated with this. Does anyone have similar problem on their phone and/or if you have any suggestions to fix this? TIA!",

The fact that all she did was try something that wasn’t yet another ballade, but was instead met with a firestorm of rage is crazy (some people were even threatening to report her to the government to have them step in and deal with her). Was really hoping the conservatism in the Chinese music industry would finally start fading, but I guess I was wrong…",

I'm not super big into cpop, so I don't know all the places to find unknown artists like I do for other genre's, but thank you in advance.\n\nTheir artist name is \"乐瑶\", here's a link to their [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6PIjAxOSA2dRAvnsq4SDSr?si=31W-TSOfTVGjjrtj_-oc-Q), as well as their topic on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSM7iQl-EnKAcHb3qyJNQPw), but that's literally all I could find about them. I know it's vague, but I'm just extremely curious.\n\nThere's also a ton (like 40+ just from the suggested) of other spotify profiles that've posted crazy amounts of albums all in 2025, which seem to follow the same kind of format.\n\nThx in advance for any info!",

Two of her albums had physical releases.\n\nI have been digging all over the internet and have yet to find anyone selling them. Nothing over on Discogs. I did find the listing to both albums on YesAsia, but they are unfortunately either out of stock or out of print.\n\nIt’s a hell of a long shot, but I was wondering if any of you knew where I could look? I love physical media and would really like to have these two albums in my collection!!\n\nCan’t link the pages in this post, here’s the info:\n\nArtist: Meng Jia (孟佳) Albums: Jia (Debut EP) and JIALAND\n\nThank you all!!",

    "content": "Hello all,\n\nI was the Redditor that posted the JiaJia post couple weeks ago.\n\nShe just released a new album called-- 你给我的 and its lead single (of the same name) seems to be doing quite well on Spotify and KKBOX and Asia radio airwaves (considering she's a really underrated singer with over a decade long career)\n\nI strongly urge yall to check it out. Sonically it is a very cohesive album and her tone is so beautiful. I felt that her previous album-- 我想要的 (2019) (very underrated)，was quite interesting sonically as it explored a lot of different sounds and had some deep cuts, but sonically not as cohesive as this new one\n\nIts quite a easy listen and I enjoyed the 70/80s inspired production and sound of every track. Over the years, Jia Jia has moved away from those big rangy songs (which I miss) and her style of singing has also changed (maybe age has to play a role cuz there isnt as much vocal power anymore). Her vocals tend to blend with the production now rather than stand out from the production.\n\nI believe-- to be a good singer, you dont have to be the rangiest/most technically honed singer, but simply sing from the heart and I think Jiajia does that the best! In her own words, 她确实是“很爱唱歌”\n\nEither way, I really enjoy listening to her new album and it has been on repeat over the past few days haha\n\nRecommended songs (in no order):\n\n1. 再见那个谁-- has this very dreamy and floaty vibe to it as she comes to term with moving forward from a relationship\n2. 月不落-- penned and composed by JiaJia herself! RnB vibes with beautiful harmonies and layered vocals\n3. 分了吧-- very catchy and badass sounding (reminiscent of 看透)\n4. 放飞-- very groovy 80s disco self empowerment vibes. like wind down my (non existent) car windows and vibe kinda feel--&gt; freedom and liberation\n5. 我爱的歌 and 你给我的-- both have very poignant nostalgia feel to it with a tinge of sadness to it and reminiscent of a lost love\n6. MY ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE-- [你呢 (feat. 麋先生 聖皓)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=glBehCK2944&amp;list=OLAK5uy_l3t5yXvgZ7lSPFE8E4hz62eILEFQqkbSs). I listen to it for 24 hours a day. Theres something so alluring about that untuned piano and guitar and her voice. 麋先生 from Mixerband also adds depth to the song and their voices blend so well. SUCH A SAD SONG TBH idk what it is about the song but everything is perfect, so vulnerable yet brings a weird sense of comfort as well\n\nThanks for hearing me out!! I love Jiajia",

    "content": "對不起周董. I was not familiar with your game until now. \n\nAs a 90's kid, for the longest time, I held the opinion that Jay Chou was overrated. Everyone around me was obsessed with him. His most popular songs were all mostly about love and sounded like generic pop music. His singing was okay. He wasn't as good-looking as all the girls would lead me to believe. I really didn't understand why everyone was so in love with him.\n\n20 years later now in my 30s, I'm diving deeper into his music and holy shit he is an immense depth of talent. I feel so silly for writing him off as just a teenage heartthrob. Classically-trained pianist. Introducing traditional Chinese instruments in his music. Popularizing rap in mandopop. His talent and love for music goes so far beyond his most popular love ballads. \n\nSure, I can't understand a single word in 告白氣球, and the song would absolutely sound worse if he sung every word clearly. But then you have other songs like 爸 我回來了 which is an absolute masterpiece. Even as someone who was never beaten as a child, the visceral imagery chilled me to my bones. \n\nI used to feel that his music and persona was over-commercialized, and that his movie 不能說的秘密 was self-indulgent and overly self-gratulating. While that may still be true, the core of Jay Chou is his undeniable passion for music and contributions in popularizing other music styles in the Chinese music scene. It was unfair for me to write him off as a generic love-ballad artist. ",

Later on they're on a bridge with two girls, and three boys dancing. Their is a lot of choreographed dancing, in both a room with a bookcase as a background, and a blue room. At one point they look at a pool table with calculations on it, and they also get test results (I think). Later on, any help finding the song would be much appreciated. ",

    "content": "I have recently come across an artist called Zou Peipei on Tiktok with her song named [Drowning (沉溺)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obCmHh0aTFk). This got me interested in Chinese r&amp;b. Before that, I have listened to Chinese r&amp;b songs such as [Lover (情人)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxDMW9UHSHc) but I didn't know it was r&amp;b. \n\nChinese r&amp;b has got to be one of the most sensual and magical genres of music out there. Zou Peipei's discography is just magical too. Somehow every of her songs slaps. \n\nHer r&amp;b songs:\n\n* Dream (梦臆) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM1A2H8AsJ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM1A2H8AsJ4)\n* Fantasy (内心幻想) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-u-KunpFMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-u-KunpFMQ)\n* 惦念你 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPgq\\_sx8\\_P4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPgq_sx8_P4)\n* 我的男孩 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEzxNa1fjsk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEzxNa1fjsk)\n\nOther than r&amp;b, her other genres are magical, especially city pop:\n\n* Overload (邢益豪) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxH89QFcwY8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxH89QFcwY8)\n* Purple Butterfly (紫蝴蝶) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X839wbkf4dM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X839wbkf4dM)\n* 月光下曖昧 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWS5aVzEI2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWS5aVzEI2s)\n\nThis is one of the best things that has happened in C-pop really.

She also has no tour and not much promo?\n\nWas wondering what is her music trajectory now cuz she keeps on singing the same few songs in music festivals and smaller concerts.. I think she has potential for something bigger but it seems like her career has plummeted sadly.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Jiajia, would love to hear ",

Just wanted to share that Janice Vidal (衛蘭) has dropped her brand new song “The Best Version of Me”, and it’s absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe lyrics are so therapeutic and meaningful, especially if you’re going through a tough time or on a journey of growth. It’s all about embracing who you are, healing, and becoming a stronger version of yourself—one step at a time. The melody is soft yet powerful, and her voice as always… pure magic.\n\nIt’s out now on all major music platforms—Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube etc.\nI’ve been looping it non-stop. Highly recommend giving it a listen if you need something comforting and soul-soothing.\n\nLet’s support Janice and her artistry!\nAlso, I just started a small fan community based in Singapore—if anyone here loves Janice too, come chat with me!",

    "content": "Just discovered ‘No Reason’ by Ryan B &amp; Effie—where has Chinese music been all my life??\n\nI’m always on the lookout for new music, and today I randomly stumbled upon this song. It sounds soooo good to my ears, I’ve had it on loop since morning. Now I feel like I need to dive deeper into the Chinese music scene...\n\nThe only Chinese music I’ve heard before is OSTs, but I haven’t really explored beyond that. Maybe I’ve come across some songs without realizing, but honestly? You can say I’m completely new to all this.\n\nI loved the vibe of 'No Reason' by Ryan B and Effie. The smooth chill energy with soft beats and those dreamy vocals. Such an earcandy. Obsessed!!! I would love to know more songs like those.\n\nIn general, I’m drawn to slow, jazzy music or acoustic kinda music. I really enjoy emotional ballads, and chill songs with soft beats. I’m not really into high-energy pop, but I do enjoy soft pop when it’s done well.\n\nAlso, I’m not a huge rap enthusiast, but I love it when it’s blended smoothly into vocal songs. I have a very specific taste in rap. I love that soft, rhythmic, flowy rap that blends effortlessly into a song rather than feeling like pure “rap.” The kind that almost sounds melodic instead of aggressive. No Reason had that same vibe, and I’d love to find more songs like that!\n\nIf you have underrated gems that deserve more love, please drop them too. I love finding hidden treasures.\n\nSo where should I start? Drop your best Chinese music recommendations &lt;3",

    "content": "After many months of listening to cpop, I finally discovered Kelly Chen, and she's amazing! First, there's the fact that she sings in Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, and English. Then there's the range of songs she sings, from soft ballads (including the best ever rendition of \"A Lover's Concerto\") to some signature dance-pop hits.\n\n5. 大 (Cantonese) -- I can't tell you what this song is about, but damn, it's spicy! Somewhere on the Internet, I saw someone contrast Cantonese with Mandarin by describing the former as spicier, and this song is a good example. It starts off with heavy drum beats, and then the Cantonese words in the bridge just jump out at you.\n\n4. [Typewriter](https://youtu.be/eL2-P-LqVko?si=HNyvCxpQ0LTM7er8)/打字机 (Mandarin) -- This is a fun song with some voice acting in it. Kelly sings as an overworked office secretary just dreaming of the weekend. Wait for the part when she talks about how she's lost an important paper on her desk and then says, \"huh\" -- super cute!\n\n3. [Yeah Yeah Yeah](https://youtu.be/PpmeaaYqhYc?si=m4PocIKZiRS13XI5) (Cantonese) -- This song has a pretty cool 60s pop/rock vibe. She does this totally adorable squeal about 2/3 of the way into the song!\n\n1b. [Big Day/大日子](https://youtu.be/fb-pFRwI1i4?si=AeyG6F_hLVRfYzjo) (Cantonese), [A Good Place](https://youtu.be/lSh_jxjdwAg?si=YXPc9WvieKYH6OBR)/好地方 (Mandarin) -- This is kind of like her anthem, with the opening chant of \"Kelly, want to move my body/Want to shake it shake it, baby.\" It's got very much an 1980s pop sound to it with a smooth melody.\n\n1a. [Paisley Galaxy/花花宇宙](https://youtu.be/WK9qq2k2_SM?si=PbadQmmxw0joV81e) (Cantonese), [Amazing](https://youtu.be/IffKdVMJe08?si=UjKm5LSBf-Pu49bn)/不得了 (Mandarin) -- Okay, if I have to choose, I guess this is the true #1. It too would have fit perfectly in the 1980s with its steady drumbeat and heavy synth rhythm, and it's got an uplifting message about the importance of living well. It's also known as the claw machine song.",

I love the grainy style of the MV (also the mountains where this MV was filmed, stunning). This also explains why he was singing in such a cold landscape when performing 就是哪吒 with Zhang Jiaming 张珈铭, he was probably filming this at the same time. This song somehow feels like one of Joker Xue's love songs, like 认真的雪 or something. The messy hair really suits him actually.\n\nLyricist: Wen Chuchu 温楚楚  \nComposer: Sean Tang 唐汉霄  \nPerformed by: Sean Tang 唐汉霄\n\n\\[MV\\]: [https://youtu.be/iW4UviKAfyE?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/iW4UviKAfyE?feature=shared)",

The demo was given to Hua Chenyu with the hopes that more Chinese listeners would hear the song. Hua Chenyu selected Aska Yang 杨宗纬 to collaborate on this song, as he believed his vocals were suitable for this song. Dai Yuedong 代岳东 wrote the Chinese lyrics. Thus, the Chinese version, King and Beggar《国王与乞丐》was created.  \nLyricist: Dai Yuedong 代岳东  \nComposer: Mike Chan, Faizal Tahir  \nPerformed by: Hua Chenyu 华晨宇, Aska Yang 杨宗纬  \n\\[MV\\]: [https://youtu.be/XiyEwRlyKl4?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/XiyEwRlyKl4?feature=shared)",

    "content": "MV Link: https://youtu.be/8SNI9YNR7pQ?feature=shared\n\nArtist YouTube Link: https://youtube.com/@sodagreenofficial\n\nWith the re-release of the album 冬 未了 (*Winter Endless*), the Taiwanese indie band 苏打绿 Sodagreen has concluded the remake project of all ten of its previously released albums, which began in 2022 and involved re-recording all songs individually. (Due to a trademark dispute with their former producer, the members lost the rights to the original music, so they decided to produce it again. asianpopweekly offers more details on the situation here (albeit outdated): https://www.reddit.com/r/cpop/s/NcXALFZldh) Recently, Sodagreen also released a documentary, [The Endless Journey](https://youtu.be/iAD6eURdLOQ?feature=shared), on their YouTube channel, which details the members’ experiences over the past ten years since the original release of *Winter Endless*.\n\nAnyway, enough about the band’s history (I’m bad at explaining but wanted to give an overview). Part of the *Winter Endless* album—my personal favorite album from the band— 下雨的夜晚 (“Rainy Night”) is a melancholy yet uplifting ballad, the most popular song in the album and one of Sodagreen’s most popular songs overall. If you haven’t already, go listen to the album on YT or a streaming platform! Its music is symphonic-themed; along with the rest of the Vivaldi Project albums, it is truly a work of art, and there is so much more to it than just its biggest hit. Learning about Sodagreen’s music and lyrics is like diving into an unending rabbit hole.\n\nWith all that said, I hope you enjoy! This is my first time posting here, but I really enjoy Sodagreen and their music and I wanted to share.",
