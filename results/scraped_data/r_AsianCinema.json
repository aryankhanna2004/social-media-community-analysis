    "content": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yn4LaSIOPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yn4LaSIOPE)\n\nWhen someone talks about the Japanese movie industry in the 00s, inevitably the discussion goes towards anime, which, in the specific decade, accounted for 60% of the local film production. With films like Miyazaki’s “Spirited Away” and the rest of Studio Ghibli’s productions, along with masterpieces from Satoshi Kon, Mamoru Oshii, Katsuhiro Otomo and other great filmmakers, there is no wonder why the 00s were considered “Japanese Cinema’s Second Golden Age”, particularly for the penetration of local films in cinemas around the world.\n\nHowever, anime were not the only story Japanese cinema had to tell in this decade. Yojiro Takita also won an Oscar, Shinji Aoyama and Naomi Kawase won at Cannes, Hirokazu Koreeda continued his successful festival run, Yoji Yamada made an exceptional trilogy of samurai films, Shunji Iwai directed one of the most critically acclaimed film of the decade, Kinji Fukasaku released his last film and Takeshi Kitano his most successful. Furthermore, cult (exploitation) and horror favorites Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Takashi Miike and Sion Sono established themselves as masters of the categories, while a number of independent directors also arose.\n\nCheck the full list in the video and let us know which titles you would add to the list",

The video featured a villain and a Hero both wearing suits and the Hero chasing the villain to a rooftop. What I remember standing out to me was that the villain/bad guy kissed the Hero on the mouth twice (In a really taunting not to be taken seriously way) which I didn't expect for an action movie. I've been trying to find the movie ever since I saw the video but I can't for the life of me find anything. I remember the title containing \"-angels\" or something but I might be mistaken. Please help me because I've been trying to find the movie and video for a while.",

Recently, we started a YouTube channel for all the short films we've curated over the years because we really want these films to find an audience outside of their home countries and Asia. Initially they were only available in certain countries behind a paywall (not expensive, but still rather limiting).\n\nIt's called **CinemaSHORTasia** ([view YT channel here](http://youtube.com/@CinemaSHORTAsia)), and right now it's still a small channel, but we believe there is an audience out there that would be interested in and wanting to support the growing Asian filmmaking scene.\n\nDo check the channel out, and of course, subscribe!

I believe the film was Japanese and took place in an apartment building/Hotel that was filled with demons/ghouls/spirits. It was haunted or had something to do with hell?\n\nThere was also a doorman/desk clerk which was the protagonist's uncle or grandpa. I also remember it being quite surreal and experimental. It had a similar style to House(1977) in its effects. Because of the poor quality of these effects, i have reason to believe it was made sometime from the 80s -early 2000s. It's the strangeness of the film that makes me so desperate to find it.\n\nI've already tried giving ChatGPT this info and have not had success in finding the film.\n\nHas anyone seen this film or know the title?",

    "content": "I’ve already tried the “what’s this movie” Reddit page and someone suggested that the Asian Cinema Reddit could help me, so here I am.\nThis is just copy and pasted from my other Reddit post, but this is the description:\n\nI don’t know if it is a fever dream or something because my sister doesn’t remember watching the movie with me as kids, but I’d still like to try and find it. I know this may seem like some strange furry movie, but I remember it being wholesome: So there is this cat-man (with glasses? And a suit) and he is grumpy and maybe even morally grey at the beginning and he meets this rabbit-girl (enthusiastic, short red hair? Photographer) and for some reason they have to go on an adventure on an island (I think) to do something. I think that there was a significant pet that had something to do with the plot, but I’m not sure. Anyway, the cat-man softens up and in the end they fall in love and get married and maybe even keep the pet. I feel like the cat-man had an evil boss (a crocodile? But I’m not sure) who wanted to do something with the pet but I’m not sure. I know this sounds like a strange ahh furry fever dream movie (please believe me), but I’d like to find it to maybe even rewatch it. I watched it several times in Chinese early 2010s, but I’m not sure whether or not it’s the original language. The style was somewhat like anime, if I remember correctly. I really need help, I’ve already tried Google and AI tools but that can’t find a specific title. Google Gemini gave me “Mr. Cat and Ms. Rabbit” as a possible similar title but I don’t know 🥲. \n\nAnother thing is that I was like seven or something when I watched this movie, so I may have remembered something incorrectly. If some of this seems familiar, please leave a suggestion.\n\nAnyway, thanks in advance to anyone who reads this and may have an idea which movie I’m talking about or also vaguely remembers this, and in the meantime, I shall search the rest of the internet.\n\n",

I’m searching for information about the cinematography in some of Toshiaki Toyoda’s movies. \n\nIn particular, I’m trying to find articles, magazines, and videos that talk about N. Kasamatsu and J. Fujisawa cinematography in these three films:\n\n* **P\\*\\*\\*ostar** (1998) - Cinematographer: *Norimichi Kasamatsu*\n* **Blue Spring** (2001) - Cinematographer: *Norimichi Kasamatsu*\n* **Nine Souls** (2003) - Cinematographer: *Jun’ichi Fujisawa*\n\nWhat I really love about these movies is the emotional depth they succeed to reach with framing, camera movements and atmosphere choices (lighting, set design, film stock, film development, lenses), as well as with actors and scripts of course. I’m sure that, as a cinematographer, it must be a privilege to contribute to the visual storytelling of films that delve into such pure and profound feelings. For these reasons, I would like to have more info about these movies, in order to understand what tools they decided to use and especially why. The only thing I’ve been able to find is the making of *Nine Souls*.\n\nI also sent an email to Japanese Society of Cinematographers hoping they will reply, so maybe I can find something in their magazine. I’m not even sure whether any articles or discussions exist on the internet because I wasn’t able to find anything.  \nCould anyone help me in this research? Do someone has some advice on how to proceed? :)",

Now in his 70s, the Japanese filmmaker still insists on coming up with the occasional live-action, with “I Can’t Stop Biting You”, based on his own animated series, “Vlad Love”, being the latest one. \n\nCheck the full review in the link",

    "content": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBerUT2Xe4U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBerUT2Xe4U)  \n  \nIndonesia’s horror renaissance blooms from decades of strict censorship that suppressed supernatural intensity and social commentary. Post-1998 reforms ignited gradual change, but the true revolution arrived via an audience insurgence. Box office records shattered as “Satan’s Slaves” (2017) and “Impetigore” (2019) drew millions, proving horror’s commercial power. \n\nStreaming platforms amplified this hunger—Netflix acquisitions like “The Queen of Witchcraft” sparked global fan theories, while TikTok challenges recreated “Sorop”’s digital ghost. Social media discussions now drive narratives, with Gen Z demanding bolder critiques of corruption, extremism, and environmental decay. This synergy—directors weaponizing folklore against modern rot and crowds craving cultural catharsis—fuels Southeast Asia’s most electrifying horror wave. \n\nCheck the full list in the video and let is know which films you would add to the list",

After her release from prison seeks the reward promised to her - her modest goal is simply to purchase an apartment. The film features a guy in a wheelchair - and an attractive woman with who she works. ln the end, after a shootout on a dark road, she gets her bag of money from a rich woman (related to the guy in the wheelchair?) - and in the last scene is seen eating a piece of fish she buys from a vendor on a wharf by the ocean.

In Asian cinema, where family, community, and generational ties run deep, the portrayal of childhood has been both tender and transformative. From the neorealist streets of postwar Japan to the rural villages of Bhutan and the urban sprawl of modern China, these films capture the wonder, pain, and awakening of youth. Spanning over seven decades and more than a dozen countries, this collection traces how Asian filmmakers have reimagined what it means to grow up — on screen and in spirit.\n\nCheck the full 40 titles in the link and let us know which titles you would add to the list",

The synergy between generations of action stars brings a balance between intense fight choreography and grounded drama.  \n  \nThe emotional core is driven by the moral decay of the police officers—initially portrayed as righteous but ultimately corrupted by the pursuit of justice.

Add to that a sense of peculiar humor, extreme techniques used to depict horrific moments with stark realism, broken taboos, and a total disregard for political correctness, and you have the foundation of this list.Naturally, narrowing the countless shocking scenes in Japanese cinema down to just 15 is no easy task. However, with a focus on diversity, here are some of the most unforgettable and jarring examples. Some of the scenes described were difficult to find so I opted for something similar instead, from the same movie.\n\nCheck the full list in the video in the comments and let us know what other scenes you would add to the list",

Yeah! Cute guys can contribute to Chinese dramas. Nonetheless, Costume Period Dramas could get boring quickly without Action.

Before moving on to directing for television, he gained experience working as an editor and assistant director.

Her topic is quite harsh, since it involves a case of a relationship between a school student and a teacher that ended in a double suicide and a social outcry that completely ruined the lives of both families. Yuko’s focus is in presenting the truth in the most genuine way possible, but the channel producers prefer to have a tamer program, which will present the whole case as a student-versus-faculty deal. Despite the unspoken threat of no air-time at all, Yuko is set to present the whole truth, which involves interviewing the families of both deceased’s, which are initially reluctant, though, to speak in front of the camera.\n\nApart from a director, Yuko also teaches in her father’s, Tetsuya, cram school (in a comment highlighting that one cannot live just on shooting documentaries). One of the students there, Mei, seems to have a health issue, and Yuko soon finds herself helping the girl in all aspects, as she reminds her much of herself, particularly since they both grew up without a mother. The two of them come quite close, but soon Yuko finds herself face to face with a scandal that is about to break much closer home, threatening both her life and her career. As the twists about what is actually happening come crashing, Yuko has to face a number of dilemmas revolving her various capacities, and her issue of simply caring too much.\n\nCheck the full review in the link and let us know your thoughts on the movie",

It’s about two brothers or maybe they were best friends who had a crush on the same girl growing up. It’s a coming of age movie. There’s a time skip I think from adolescence into mid-adulthood. The friends/brothers reconnect. One actually went away and became a doctor, married with said crush (I think) and has kids. The other is not as successful just a regular guy.\n\nKey scenes:\n\n1.\t⁠Girl is washing her clothes at the waterfall/river with her feet and the two boys are looking over her. She looks up and smiles at them.\n2.\t⁠As adults, they meet during the Festival of Lights or some festival involving lights and just reminisce on their lives and the choices that led them to that point.\n\nI appreciate all your help. I watched this maybe 2000 - 2008. I definitely before 2008 for sure. Maybe up to 2006? I don’t know. I am really fond of this movie.

As far as I can remember, they shot a lot of material for the film and had plans to release snippets/clips/scenes/sequences to the internet and let internet users arrange full length movies out of those fragments in an interactive way which would then complement the aesthetics and motives of Mambo.\n\nTo my knowledge, no actual movie of this kind was ever conducted, but I was wondering if perhaps some of the material was ever released to the public (and thus to the potential arrangers of new films). \n\nDid maybe anyone ever stumble upon one of these scenes or snippets, or was it really just an idea that was floating around but never actually realized to any degree?",

Our version relocates the story to Hong Kong and places it against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement in Asia, keeping the same claustrophobic intensity while adding cultural depth.\n\nSome early reviews:\n\n“A crushing work of psychological confrontation; with the same sledgehammer intensity one associates with Glengarry Glen Ross or The Dresser.” – Film Threat\n\n“TAPE is a gripping and intelligent work that transcends its minimalist setup. Driven by sharp writing, resonant themes, and compelling performances, it pushes its audience to confront uncomfortable truths, and nearly earns the title of a modern masterpiece.” – Asian Movie Pulse\n\n“A profound re-examination of how we confront uncomfortable truths about misdeeds and the people who commit them… a powerful catalyst for moving past simplistic judgments and engaging with messy, uncomfortable realities.” – Resonate\n\n\nIt’s rare to see minimalist indie films reinterpreted across cultures like this and I'd love to hear your view on whether remakes like this breathe new life into stories or should certain indies stand as one-offs?\n\n(Full disclosure: I directed and produced the film, and am happy to answer questions about the adaptation process or indie distribution if that’s useful.)",

And while her later movies also entail this style, “Sakuran” remains the one where this approach finds its apogee.\n\nCheck the full review in the link and let us know your thoughts on the film and Ninagawa's style",

Known collectively as the “Yakuza Papers” or “Battles Without Honor and Humanity” series, these five films chart the rise and fall of post-war gangsters in Hiroshima with unflinching realism. Fukasaku’s jittery handheld camerawork, fragmented editing, and focus on betrayal over loyalty gave birth to the jitsuroku eiga (true record films), setting a new standard for gritty, politically charged storytelling. Together, they remain a cornerstone of Japanese cinema and a touchstone for crime narratives worldwide.\n\nCheck the full list in the link and let us know your thoughts on the films",

The first titles that come to mind are “City of Life and Death” and “Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre.” The latest entry in this category is “Dead to Rights,” a Chinese production that has already achieved huge commercial success, surpassing 308 million dollars at the box office by August 14.\n\nThe story is inspired by true events, with its central setting based on the Huadong Photo Studio, historically located near today’s Guyilang area in Nanjing. In early 1938, an apprentice named Luo Jin discovered negatives containing images of atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers while developing film sent by officers. Risking his life, he developed the images and compiled them into an album. Years later, facing hardship, Luo joined a communications training team under Wang Jingwei’s collaborationist government and hid the album inside a restroom at Pilu Temple. In 1941, the album was discovered and secretly preserved by Wu Liankai, who was training there at the time.\n\nAfter Japan’s surrender in 1945, Wu, who had by then changed his name to Wu Xuan, learned that the Nanjing Provisional Senate was gathering evidence for the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal. He submitted the album, which became crucial in the conviction of Hisao Tani, one of the main perpetrators of the massacre. Today, the album is preserved at the Second Historical Archives of China. \n\nCheck the full review in the link and let us know your thoughts on the film\n\n",

If she is found to be unfaithful, the order is simple—she must be killed. When Sun-woo discovers her with a lover, though, he makes a fateful choice. Instead of carrying out his duty, he lets them go, and in doing so sets into motion a violent chain of betrayals, rivalries, and revenge that ultimately turns his entire world against him.\n\nCheck the full video review in the link and let us know your thoughts on the film",

A director, screenwriter, and cinematographer, Chung is equally known under his pseudonym Nagao Nakashima when working behind the camera, with his credits including films such as “The Great Buddha+”, at least until “The Falls“, where he credited himself as DP.\n\nHis career spans an impressive range of works including commercials, music videos, documentaries, and narrative features, and he has twice won the prestigious Golden Horse Award for Best Director. His films, marked by a combination of realism, psychological tension, and profound reflections on family and society, have positioned him as a unique voice in Taiwanese cinema.\n\nCheck the full article in the link and let us know your thoughts on Chung Mong-hong",

And then there’s *Exhuma*, a psychological horror from Jang Jae-hyun that’s leading the Asian Film Awards nominations.\n\nDo you think this signals a new wave or renaissance for Korean film? Or is it just a strong year for a few big names?

Considering the three other of the four classic novels of China have been made multiple times on films during the Shaw Brother's peak in 1960-1980?\n\nSure Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a much grander epic story but considering they managed to remake Journey to the West multiple times, I can't see why they couldn't make an effective condensed script of Three Kingdoms which their multiple Dream of the Red Chamber and Water Margin adaptations managed to do!",

Yet, rarely is mention made of another remarkable filmmaker who delivered what may be the greatest gangster film in Taiwan: Hsu Hsiao-ming.  \n  \nHis \"Dust of Angels\" remains an underrated gem, overlooked by many and seen only by a limited audience.  \nThe story is about two teenagers, A-Guo and A-Douzi, who use drugs and hang around with gangster all day. During the 1990s, Taiwanese economy had reached its highest point, and the society changed faster than any periods in history. The economic boom gave gangsters opportunities to gain their power in business and politics. Teenagers like the main characters were easily absorbed and became part of it. After getting involved in a homicide event in their home town, A-Guo and A-Douzi are forced to flee to Taipei to find shelter. As they try to survive in the concrete jungle, they do everything they can to make a statement, proving they’re tougher than anyone. However, little do they know that their blunt behaviors make them the target of mafia. The situation becomes more and more complex, beyond their control. They start to realize the truly dark side of being in a gang, but they are unable to get out…  \n  \nCheck the full review in the link and let us know if you have seen this underrrated gem\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm trying to remember the name of an old Asian movie I watched around 1990 on VHS. It might have been Chinese, Korean, or dubbed.\n\nHere’s what I remember:\n\n* There were about 5–6 heroes and 1 female character.\n* The group ends up in a jungle, and there are lots of fights.\n* One of the heroes (likely Sammo Hung or someone like him — heavy build and comic fighter) hides by replacing a statue’s head with his own.\n* He stands still with two bricks in his hands. When the villain walks by, thinking it's a real statue, the hero suddenly hits him with the bricks.\n* I remember it being very funny and over-the-top with slapstick martial arts.\n* I thought the movie was called **“Good Boys”**, but I haven’t been able to find it anywhere, so the title might be different or localized.\n\nDoes anyone recognize this movie?",

    "content": "\n\nStars Im Siwan as Suh Yun-bok and Ha Jung-Woo as Sohn Kee-chung  (Photos are screenshots)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 1936 Summer Olympic Games held in Germany, most Americans recall the Track and Field specialist Jesse Owens, an outstanding Black athlete. He won four Gold Medals in Track and Field in front of Hitler. Some say that Hitler protested and refused to greet Jesse Owens and others say that he did not. Nonetheless, Koreans know about another controversy at these same Summer Olympic Games held in Germany in 1936. This controversy involved Korean Marathon Gold Metal Winner Sohn Kee-chung, who ran under the Japanese name Son Kitei. Although a Korean, Sohn Kee-chung’s country of origin was recognized as Japan, because Korea was occupied by Japan at that time. (Japan lost occupation over Korea during World War II in August 1945, ending 35 years of rule over Korea).\r\n\r\nA True Story\n\r\nThe Korean movie ‘Road to Boston’ is about Marathon runner Sohn Kee-chung and his fight to get a Korean representative into the Marathon race in the next Summer Olympic Games held after War II. The road to that goal had to go through Boston, Massachusetts, USA. This is a true story. The movie is an emotional story with great storytelling. It relates the political fight necessary to accomplish this goal. The movie has great acting and a great music score. The backstory is very moving, as it highlights one of the Marathon runners coached by Sohn Kee-chung for the Boston Marathon in 1947, Suh Yun-bok. \r\n\r\nQuote: “What is the most important quality a marathon runner needs to have?”, Sohn Kee-chung Nam. “Endurance”, said a Marathoner. “The most important quality a Marathoner needs is talent.” , said Sohn Kee-chung Nam.\r\n\r\nTo get to the 1948 Summer Olympics to be held in London, Korea had to establish a record of wins in International competition. The Olympic win in 1936 for Japan and would not count. Korea had no record since its wins in the 1936 Olympics which were all accredited to Japan. In order to compete in the 1948 Summer Olympic Games, Korean needed an International win of some sort. The Road to Boston is about this struggle. \r\n\r\nSummer Olympic Gold Medalist Marathon runner Sohn Kee-chung in the 1936 Olympics in Germany represented Japan. Therefore, Olympic Athletes ran under the Japanese flag. \r\n\r\n\r\n\n",

It inspired a massive franchise, along with countless imitations around the world, not just original properties, but even a remake in Indonesia a decade after the original. Now, director Hadrah Daeng Ratu follows up that remake with a wholly impressive sequel, “The Book of Sijjin and Illiyyin,” currently screening at the Fantasia International Film Festival. \n\nThe story follows Yuli (Yunita Siregar), once a sincere and kind woman, whose life has been shattered, losing her home, abandoned by her parents, falsely accused of infidelity, and treated like a maid for decades by Ambar’s (Djenar Maesa Ayu) family. Overwhelmed by bitterness and humiliation, Yuli turns to a shaman for help, seeking vengeance through black magic.\n\nThe targets of her wrath include Laras (Dinda Kanyadewi), Ambar’s domineering and ill-tempered daughter; Rudi (Tarra Budiman), Laras’ indifferent husband; Dean (Sultan Hamonangan), their mischievous young son; and Tika (Kawai Labiba), who is devout and kind but powerless to intervene. The ritual demanded by the shaman, however, is as disturbing as it is deadly. Yuli must insert the names of her intended victims into a freshly deceased corpse, completing the task within a week—or suffer devastating consequences.\n\nCheck the full review in the link and let us know your thoughts on Indonesian horror in general",

    "content": "The Color of Paradise is a quiet, poetic film that speaks through silence and nature rather than words. Watching it in low quality gave it a nostalgic, old-soul vibe that made the experience feel even more intimate and emotional like rediscovering a faded memory.\n\nThe film’s strength lies in its sound design. Since the main character, Mohammad, is blind, the world is presented to us through his senses the wind, birds, water all louder, fuller, and more alive. There isn’t much dialogue, and that calm atmosphere made the film feel more genuine and spiritual.\n\nAlthough I didn’t deeply connect with the father’s emotional arc, the symbolism throughout the story was powerful. The final river scene felt raw and real, not staged, and left a lasting impression. The beauty of the film lies in its simplicity it lets you feel rather than think, and that’s what makes it unforgettable.\n",

In Love and Deep Waters is a story of how a ship’s Butler keeps his clients satisfied. He has a very subservient attitude. It never dawns on him that he should be any other way. That is until the young son of a rich person’s maid tells him to take a good look at his actions. This movie offers an eclectic bag of drama emotions as its characters’ backstories are isolated. Some may like this story, which is a Murder Mystery Suspense RomCom.\r\n\r\nFrom celebrated Japanese writer Yuji Sakamoto.\r\n\r\nWinner of the International Film Music Critics Award (IFMCA)\r\n",

    "content": "My Experience with the Korean Series \"Trigger\":\n\n\"Trigger\" is not just a drama, but an intellectual and philosophical experiment that poses an existential question:\nIs justice absolute or relative? Is man inherently good or merely constrained by his lack of power?\n\nMoon Baek's character played the role of a philosopher rather than a criminal. He distributed weapons to people not for the sake of killing, but to test them:\n\nDo we refrain from killing because we believe in goodness? Or simply because we lack the means?\n\nThe result was painful… Most people, once they possessed weapons, chose to kill.\n\nAnd herein lies the point: weapons didn't change them; they revealed their true nature.\n\nAs for Detective Do, he is a model of human contradiction.\n\nDespite having sworn not to carry a weapon, he returned and killed with his own hand, justifying it by saying that they were \"evil.\"\n\nBut who decides who is evil?\n\nThus, he himself became judge and executioner, and his justice was merely a reflection of his personal opinion… a relative, fickle justice.\n\nThe ending was one of the most powerful moments of the series.\n\nDo pulls the trigger, chaos erupts, and then runs to hug a small child amid the devastation.\n\nThe symbolism of this scene deeply touched me:\n\nNo matter how \"noble\" your intentions, when you choose violence, you cannot control its consequences.",

From the cyberpunk chaos of “Tetsuo: The Iron Man” to the quiet brutality of “Killing”, Tsukamoto’s 16 feature films have defined a genre of their own—merging body horror, psychological drama, and experimental cinema.\n\nIn the video in the link, the team at Asian Movie Pulse ranks all of Tsukamoto’s feature-length films, excluding his shorts, student films, and omnibus segments—but including “Haze” (extended version). Whether you’re a hardcore Tsukamoto fan or just beginning to explore Japanese cult cinema, this ranked list will guide you through the highlights—and occasional misfires—of a truly singular filmography.\n\nFeaturing insights and votes from Sean Barry, Rouven Linnarz, Andrew Thayne, and Panos Kotzathanasis.\n\n📽️ Which Tsukamoto film is your favorite?

By this token, “The King” offers little in the form of surprises, but does serve up an interesting look at the allure of the so-called 1%, and just how destructive hedonistic avarice can be.\n\nSweeping the box office upon release, and subsequently award nominations and victories in the months that followed, this political thriller is unlikely to disappoint, even with its rather overdrawn climax. \n\nPredominantly, the story revolves around the point-of-view character Park Tae-soo (Jo In-sung). In his youth, Tae-soo was a rebel of sorts, an adolescent who ditched studying for fist-fights, and lived his life admiring his petty crook father. However, the disobedient son soon has a change of heart when witnessing his criminal dad kneel before a prosecutor, concluding that it is those who have the brains who hold the true power in life. Thus, he hits the books, and seeks to find his way into a world he is anything but acquainted with.\n\nDespite this, Park manages to enter (and then graduate from) the prestigious Seoul National University, consequently achieving both his goal of becoming a prosecutor, and also the type of man he perceives to have power and status. Yet, just as briskly as he breaks into the field, Tae-soo ascertains that this lifestyle is not all that glamorous, and often revolves around mundane admin work, with little thanks afforded. Fortunes can quickly change though, and after insisting on probing into a sexual assault case involving an affluent man’s son, the young upstart is introduced to Yang Dong-cheol (Bae Sung-woo), a man who soon helps integrate Park into the 1% of prosecutors. These men, led by Han Kang-sik (Jung Woo-sung), seemingly hold all the sway in Korea, with connections spanning from the mafia to the electorate, and have an expansive archive of unlawful deeds ready to be exposed once “ripened.” They are hardly ethical, but with the rookie desperate to cut his teeth with the elite, finds himself drawn to the shady clique, and in due time, a fully-fledged cog in the alpha-male machine.\n\nCheck the full review in the link and let us know your thoughts on the movie",

Upon her return, she finds her daughter suffocated to death, having tried to hide in the washing machine. A year passes, but Yoshie is still guilt- and grief-ridden, until she brings home a beautiful life-size doll from an antiques market and treats it as if it were her daughter. Dismissing it as Doll Therapy, her nurse husband Tadahiro lets her have her way, until Yoshie gets pregnant again and gives birth to their second daughter, after which the doll gets put away in storage. However, when their daughter Mai turns five, she finds the doll and takes her out to play with it, which is when strange incidents start to occur in the house and around the family.  \n  \nCheck the full review in the link and let us know your thoughts on the film",

Yoo Ha, known for “Once Upon a Time in High School”, “A Dirty Carnival”, and “A Frozen Flower”, directs the project, while idols-turned-actors Kang Ji-young and Lee Gi-kwang take on the lead roles. The project also marks the return of Uhm Tae-woong, who has been inactive for nine years since his last appearance in Kim Ki-duk’s 2017 title “Excavator”.\n\nKang Sun-woo, a once-promising taekwondo athlete, saw her future derailed after she failed to give a loss during a high school championship match. Now, she leads a life of poverty and exhaustion, burdened further by the responsibility of covering her bedridden mother’s hospital bills. One day, however, her life takes a dramatic turn when people notice her uncanny resemblance to Han Ji-yeon, heiress of a major conglomerate. Ji-yeon is also the primary suspect in a fatal drunk driving hit-and-run incident. Soon, Sun-woo is approached by Director Yoon, a family employee, who offers her a large sum of money to act as Ji-yeon’s double. The request comes under the instruction of the family’s patriarch, who is about to step down as company chairman.\n\nMeanwhile, her brother Ho-joong has his own agenda and grows increasingly resentful of his sister. At the same time, Director Yoon’s role proves to be more complex than initially assumed. As more characters come into play, it becomes clear that nothing is as it seems, and Sun-woo finds herself entangled in a perilous web of deception. Fortunately, she is a formidable fighter.\n\nCheck the full review in the link and let us know your thoughts on the movie and Uhm Tae-woong's return",

Ai is an introverted, ordinary girl burdened with family troubles. One day, Yu, a transfer student recently returned from overseas, joins her school. Struggling to adjust to Japan’s rigid group mentality, he openly questions the necessity of belonging, whether to a group or even to a family. Ai becomes intrigued by him, but his emotional distance initially causes tension between them.\n\nSoon, a bizarre incident disrupts school life: a student suddenly crouches on all fours in the schoolyard and refuses to move. Despite attempts by teachers and classmates to stop him, others begin to mimic his pose. The school embraces this growing “human pyramid” phenomenon, encouraging participation as something positive. Students continue joining, wearing eerily serene expressions. Ai and Yu appear unaffected at first, but they gradually find themselves at odds with everyone around them, including the faculty. What begins as an isolated event soon escalates into a mass phenomenon that engulfs the entire community.  \n  \nCheck the full review in the link in the comments and let us know your thoughts on the film",

    "content": "\n\n\nHere is a quick Chinese movie downtime moment that will only take an hour and one half of your time, but will stick to you with afterthoughts for several days after viewing. This is the Fantasy Romance movie 0.1% World. Personally, I could loop this movie over and over to discover all that is there to take in. 1% World is the story about a girl and boy living on different continents in different time zones. Inexplicably, they become linked to each other’s brains. They can hear each other, talk to each other and at times even move the body parts of the other. Because they live in different time zones and on different continents, it becomes a challenge to live and fashion life under these circumstances. One is up when the other should be sleeping. How do you not make noise? \r\n\r\n\r\nNeither one wants to know the identity of the other at first. They just need to placate the problem by learning how to live with each other and not get in each other’s way, until they figure out how to fix this problem. Ultimately, what does this shared experience do for them? What happens if one gets emotionally attached to the other? This is such an intimate arrangement. This Chinese movie blew my mind. It invoked such deep thought surrounding their dilemma and how they chose to resolve certain issues. \r\n\r\nHow the Male and Female Leads deal with their problem? Discovery/ Compliance/ Discord\r\n\r\n\r\nActor’s Corner\r\n\r\nThe stars of the Chinese film are Zhou Yi Ran from the Chinese drama ‘When You Be Me’ (2022) and Patrick Shih from the Chinese Time Travel drama ‘Someday or One Day’ (2019). I recommend both works by both actors in addition to their collaboration in the movie  %1 World. Both actors give dynamic deliveries in 1% World. Taiwanese actor Patrick Shih speaks fluent German in this movie 0.1% World. Zhou Yi Ran is also a great young Chinese actress. Her acting abilities and range of acting are fully on display in ‘When You Be Me’.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie is free and with English subtitles on YouTube ",

    "content": "\n\n\nThe Korean movie ‘The Match’ (2025) is a wonderful and intelligent movie about a real historical event, a Championship Match between a teacher vs student in a game of Go. The game of Go is Chinese in origin, but is revered throughout Asia since the ancient Dynasties. However, the movie is about what it took to take a child prodigy Go player to the next level for competition. \r\n\r\nIn the movie, veteran acting royalty Lee Byung Hun plays Cho Hun Hyeon. In real life, Cho Hun Hyeon is considered to be the greatest Go player of all time in South Korea. He is the GOAT of GO. Yoo Ah-in plays the young protégé of Cho Hun Hyeon and gifted prodigy of Go, the real person Lee Chang Ho. Lee Byung Hun give his usual stellar performance and he was nominated for a Baeksang in 2025 in the Best Actor category. Yoo Ah-in could have been nominated too, for my taste. He has been so scandal ridden of late. I suppose that the Committee saw different options.\r\nIn the game of Go, both Cho Hun Hyeon and Lee Chang Ho have reached the level of 9 Dan, the highest ranking achieved in South Korea.\r\nFor me, The Match was well worth the time to view.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/g-dKXOlsf98?si=9mUGYQ4RRhiE8lyJ\n\n\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cho_Hun-hyun\n\n\r\n",

It’s a psychological thriller or drama with horror elements.\n\nHere’s what I remember about the plot: •\t\nThe main character is a female doctor (I think a psychiatrist or psychologist) working at a mental hospital. •\tShe believes in rehabilitation and is especially convinced that one male patient can be cured. He was previously committed for doing horrific things to children — he would shave their heads, dress them in diapers (pampers), and keep them in a freezer or locked room. •\tAfter being released (thanks to her evaluation), he visits the doctor again and says thank you for saving him. But later, another younger male patient with some kind of psychic or supernatural ability tells her that he’s doing it again. •\tThe psychic patient says he knew because he saw bite marks on the man’s arm. •\tThe doctor calls the police, and they find children again in his basement, dressed in diapers. He had started the crimes again. •\tA side plot involves the doctor’s obese mother, who watches TV all day. The doctor had a brother who died, and at the end we realize that this same man had done those things to her brother. The doctor had tried to cure him because she wanted to believe people can change, but he was a monster all along.\n\nIt’s a super disturbing, emotional film, but I can’t remember the title or find anything like it on Korean/Japanese movie lists.\n\nDoes anyone know what film this is?\n\nPLEASE, i’ve been searching for this film for so long not even chatgpt can help me :((",

It tells heartfelt stories about friendship, family, and chasing dreams — all set in everyday Chinese life.\n\nThe main characters? **Two goofy, lovable fictional bears and a grumpy, lonely, broke middle-aged lumberjack.** It’s got the perfect mix: kids love the fun and silliness, adults see the struggle and hope. Somehow, everyone finds something to connect with.\n\nThe series is called ***Boonie Bears*** — it's been going strong for over a decade.",

    "content": "I’m looking for an Asian short film (probably Korean or Japanese) that I saw on TV, aired on the I.Sat channel sometime between 2000 and 2010 in latin america. I clearly remember it was about a little girl who accidentally gets locked inside a car, and no one can open it. Eventually, a man with crutches appears, removes a long metal pin from his leg (the kind used for healing bone fractures), and uses it to unlock the car. The mother is grateful and keeps the pin. Later, at home, the girl is watching TV when she sees a trail of ants crawling into an electrical socket. Out of curiosity, she inserts the same pin into the outlet, gets electrocuted, and dies. It was a dramatic, realistic short film with a very strong impact. I only saw it once and haven’t been able to find it since. If anyone recognizes this or knows the title, I’d really appreciate the help.",

When I went to read the comments to find the name of it, the clip had been taken down. I came onto reddit after google failed to help.\n\nWhat the clip was of was three people running off a cliff. It was Wuxia (maybe), a comedy, and each one of these three people followed this sign pointing out a shortcut. Each one, separately, ran off the cliff while following the sign. One was in a hurry trying to get somewhere, another was being chased, I can't remember why the third was in a hurry. But the last image was of the three of them halfway down this cliff hanging by tree roots while a bunch of people in armor and fancy clothes looked down at them. \n\nAccording to the only comment I remember it was the first time these three meet and they became friends. \n\nCan anyone help me find the name of it?",

People begin **mutating**, developing grotesque spiral-shaped deformities, or acting under a mysterious spiral-induced madness. Even the environment turns unnatural, with spiral clouds, whirlpools, and twisted buildings.\n\nAs the spiral curse spreads, logic and reality break down. Kirie and her friend **Shuichi** try to escape, but the town is already being swallowed by the inescapable power of the spiral.\n\n  \nLosely based on the Manga.

I thought the characters were fun, the action was good, and the jokes were on point. I thought it was a really fun and funny buddy cop flick . But I thought the ending got really dark with the final reveal(s). It was really unexpected, and completely out of place, in such a silly, lighthearted movie. \n\nBut really that was my only real qualm with the film, other than it’s absolutely ridiculous 2 hour 20 minute runtime. I thought the good far outweighed the bad though. I’m looking forward to watching the sequel. \n\n",

    "content": "At first, I wouldn't watch this movie for a year because it sounded so morbid and twisted. But after seeing people talk about it lately, I decided to watch it and I'm so glad I did!\n\nIt's very unusual in multiple ways and I can't even quite explain exactly what made me love it, but it somehow left a unique feeling that keeps me thinking back to it days after watching.\n\nFirst, it surprised me with how funny it was. I was laughing so much all through the first half. I'm new to Taiwanese cinema, so I don't know if this is the norm, but I was completely dumbfounded at how funny it was. So I'd love to find more movies with this sort of humor.\n\nThen, the second half focused more on the emotional storyline and I liked that side it as well. I don't enjoy movies with characters that don't have much depth or emotional growth, so I think this is in large part the reason I liked this movie.\n\nBasically what I'm looking for is: something slightly whimsical, funny (but doesn't have to be a comedy), character depth and growth, well written story (the kind that stays with you) and it would be nice if there are LGBTQ characters, but it's okay if there aren't.\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint (in part due to my brain refusing to work from lack of sleep), but I'm guessing (hoping) that other people who watched the movie and liked it would know what I'm talking about and the kind of vibes I'm looking for.\n\nP.S: I'd prefer it if it was a Taiwanese, Hong Kong or Chinese movie, since I'm learning Mandarin (through immersion), but if a movie from another country comes to mind, please share!",

    "content": "In the '90s, a local theater used to run double features of action films from Hong Kong every Thursday. They did this for years, and I saw a bunch of movies and they sort of blur together. There are two in particular that I'd like to rewatch, but I can't remember the name of either of them.\n\nI don't have much to go on for either film, but here goes:\n\nFirst Movie\n\nAll I remember is the final scene. It ended with two cops talking about possibly working together. They were parting ways. One cop was from Hong Kong, and the other from China, and one says something along the lines of \"in 1997 we'll be working together anyway,\" referring to the pending return of Hong Kong to China. I think the movie up to that point had been a team up between the two of them. Jackie Chan was not in this movie, and it was not a comedy.\n\nSecond Movie\n\nThe main thing I remember is that the protagonist, who I think was a cop, wore a white tank top (\"wife beater\"), blue vest, brown blazer, and blue jeans through most of the film.\n\nAt one point, the bad guy drugged him and duct taped a gun to his hand, then turned him loose in public, hoping in his dazed state he'd shoot up the place and get in trouble. He spends some time staggering around a public marketplace with the gun taped to his hand, possibly even shooting, but manages not to kill any innocent people.\n\nEDIT: Since so many people are suggesting Hard Boiled, and/or The Killer-- it's neither of those. And again, neither features Jackie Chan, nor is either a comedy.",

Could anyone recommend movies where the cinematography makes nature feel like its own character?\n\nI'm particularly interested in films that showcase:\n\n1. Unique geological formations (like the karst mountains in *Shadow*)\n2. Seasonal transformations (cherry blossoms, autumn foliage, etc.)\n3. Creative use of weather elements (monsoon rains, fog, snowfall)\n\nSome favorites that come to mind are *The Assassin* (2015) for its ethereal forest scenes and *Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring* for its reflective water shots. Any hidden gems or contemporary films continuing this tradition of stunning natural cinematography?",

Everything may not be on point but it’s the best I remember. \n\nThe opening scene starts as the main male lead is cleaning his hands after cutting it by river. As he’s washing his hands he sees flower petals flowing from upstream. He follows the petals and he finds a girl who is putting the petals into the river. \n\nShe takes him back to her house for ointment where he meets her dad. She and her dad have a flower farm. \n\nHe goes back to his town where he tells them about what happened. His family is into model/fashion and he suggest using the farm. They eventually go do a shoot there where they pretty much destroy the plants and leave garbage everywhere. \n\nEventually he married her although her family is against it. He moves to the countryside with her and there he plans to write a book but with no luck no one wants to publish it. \n\nSomewhere along the line the wife goes visit the in-laws and someone sees how pretty she is and has her become a model. As she does this she grows further away from her husband. Eventually pretending like she isn’t the girl he is looking for when he shows up to a fashion show and jumps onto stage to grab her. \n\nThe ending scene is him by the river and seeing the petals again. He follows the petals and runs into the girl. He ask her what her name is and she gives her old name before she became a model. They reunite. \n\nTIA",

Soon, after his death, I decided that I would start seeing his work from the beginning to know why he was so beloved.\n\nI’ve had zero interaction with his works, and honestly haven’t been curious until recently, watching *Absurd Encounter with Fear (1967)* was the first time of seeing the absurdity in which other talk about his work, absurd in a way, just have to suspend all disbelief and let things happen without questioning.

It really made me want to return to see his full length films,\n\nIt is based on Kuniko Mukōda’s novel of the same name.\n\nGoing back and starting to see earlier works, has helped me see what themes these directors are tackling, for Kore-Eda, he is very focused on the human aspect. *In When Cinema Reflects the Time: Hou Hsou Hsien and Edward Yang (1993),* it focuses on two Titans of Taiwanese cinema, both influenced by different aspects of the country, and on another layer of history, Taiwan being colonized by the Japanese and Kore-eda own father being born in Taiwan.\n\nI need to further explore the influences between Hsien and Yang towards Kore-Eda own work, considering Edward Yang has been very high on my list. I should research this more throughout the year.\n\n***August Without Him*** *— Sypnopsis*\n\nOne of his Documentaries, released in 1994, followed his friendship with [AIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS)\n\n# My year in film - January - March 2025\n\nMy outlook on this year film direction, is coming together, im thinking about filmography and being able to see progression of directors,  \nMy outlook on this year film direction, is coming together, im thinking about filmography and being able to see progression of directors,  \nso far this year\n\n# David Lynch (8 films)\n\n*Absurd Ecounter with Fear (1967)*\n\nI’ve never seen a David Lynch, I knew few references, I always enjoyed the video showing his anger and annoyance at not being able to keep shooting until he calls cut, how everything had become so constraint by tight shooting schedules, how he “*can’t go dreamy anymore.

The work to make that baby as realisctic as they could, incredible unsettling but babies are alien at times.\n\nI think *The Grandmother (1970),* is one of the most disturbing short I’ve seen so far, the depicition of child abuse, was a lot to take in.\n\nNext Up, is *The Elephant Man (1980)*.\n\n***Filmography***  \n***Six Men Getting Sick (1967)***  \n***Sailing with Bushnell Keeler (1967)***  \n***Ficticious Anacin Commercial (1967)***  \n***Absurd Encounter with Fear (1967)***  \n***The Alphabet (1969)***  \n***The Grandmother (1970)***  \n***The Amputee (1974)***  \n***Eraserhead (1977)***\n\n# Hirokazu Kore-Eda (3 films)\n\nAsura (2025)\n\nLast year, I watched *Monster (2023)* found it to be an incredible film, as the new year was about to come, I saw he directed a tv show Asura, giving a tv show and shot since its been ages since ive invested time into tv.\n\nI really enjoyed *Asura (2025)*, the difference in sisters and how they all have to come to each others aid in different ways, in different moments of their own turmoils. It really made me want to return to see his full length films,\n\nIt is based on Kuniko Mukōda’s novel of the same name.\n\nGoing back and starting to see earlier works, has helped me see what themes these directors are tackling, for Kore-Eda, he is very focused on the human aspect. *In When Cinema Reflects the Time: Hou Hsou Hsien and Edward Yang (1993),* it focuses on two Titans of Taiwanese cinema, both influenced by different aspects of the country, and on another layer of history, Taiwan being colonized by the Japanese and Kore-eda own father being born in Taiwan.\n\nI need to further explore the influences between Hsien and Yang towards Kore-Eda own work, considering Edward Yang has been very high on my list. I should research this more throughout the year.\n\n***August Without Him*** *— Sypnopsis*\n\nOne of his Documentaries, released in 1994, followed his friendship with [AIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS)\n\n sufferer Hirata Yutaka. The documentary, titled “August without him”, followed Kore-eda as he met with Yutaka and filmed his life between 1992 and 1994. During this period, he speaks openly on his condition, as well as being the first Japanese to admit he contracted the disease via homosexual contact. The film ends with Yutaka’s condition having deteriorated, and he died of AIDS Complications on May 29, 1994.\n\n\n\nNext Up, is *Maborosi (1995)*\n\n***Filmography***  \n***When Cinema Reflects the Time: Hou Hsou Hsien and Edward Yang (1993)***  \n***August Without Him (1994)***  \n***Asura (2025)***\n\n# Lee Chang Dong (1 film)\n\nPeppermint Candy(1999)\n\n***Filmography***  \n***Green Fish (1997)***  \n***Peppermint Candy (1999)***\n\nI have to preface with *Lee Chang-Dong’s Burning(2018)* is one of my favorite films of all time, currently #12. *Peppermint Candy* has been showing up on my feed for a while, and recently I downloaded it. Due to issues with my internet, I dedicated time to all the films that have been waiting to be watched.\n\nThe premise of this movie, follows the rage of Yong-ho (Sul Kyung-gu), who is on the edge of commiting suicide upon an incoming train, the movie then takes us back to moments of his life that brought him to this point. Returning all the way to high school, in a moment of deja vu, he can not contain tears of his future self grief at a failed life.\n\nThinking about the movie after finishing, sitting in my feelings can not help to notice the incredible acting by Sul Kyung-gu. Looking up *Chang-Dong’s* filmography, there has been a lot of familiar titles when talking about asian cinema. I wasnt thinking about continuing his filmography but *Peppermint Candy* changed my mind.\n\nNext Up, is *Oasis (2002)*\n\n# Nagisa Oshima (2 films)\n\nDiary of Yunbogi (1965)\n\nNagisa Oshima has been on of my favorite directors and he solidified that position last year as I started going through some of his other films, Death by Hanging (1968), completely taken aback by so much, how heavily political it is, really made me love it, “*How can I be killed by an abstraction*”.\n\nWith his filmography, I have been all over the place but wanting to return to his earlier works to see what he had been working, as with trip to Korea, always touching upon the political reality of many people, imperialist forces after the war, korea state after its demarcation by the US. In *Diary of Yunbogi*, you can slearly see the influence of *Chris Marker’s Le Jetee (1962)* in its use of photographic still and narration.\n\n**Diary of Yunbogi — Synopsis**  \nConsisting of a series of diary entries narrated by a boy over photographs made by Oshima himself during a 1964 trip to Korea, *Yunbogi’s Diary* is a highly political tale chastising Japan’s involvement in Korea. Oshima confronts his country with the mess it made during the occupation.\n\n***Filmography***  \n***Tomorrow’s Sun (1959)***  \n***Diary of Yunbogi (1965)***\n\nNext Up, is *Street of Love and Hope (1959)*\n\n# Sara Gomez (6 films)\n\nIre a Santiago (1964)\n\n**Biography**  \nSara Gómez aka Sarita Gómez was a Cuban filmmaker. As a member of Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos during her early years, she was one of only two black filmmakers in attendance. She was the institute’s first and for her lifetime, Cuba’s only, woman director.\n\nWatched another Cuban director, wasnt excited his short film shot around the same time as Gomez it wasnt a focused, felt more like student work. Her work was more naturalistic, Ive heard her name mentioned sparsely through some readings but excited to see themes explored in her longer works. It is an unfortunate that during her lifetime she was the only woman director from Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos.\n\n***Filmography***  \n***Viejo Plaza (1960)***  \n***Fabrica de Tabaco (1962)***  \n***Ire a Santiago (1964)***  \n***Guanabacoa (1966)***  \n***Isla del Tesoro (1969)***  \n***Poder Local, Poder Popular (1970)***\n\nNext Up, is *Y … tener sabor (1967)*\n\n# Shunji Iwai ( 5 films)\n\nKyrie (2023)\n\n“All about Lily Chou-Chou” (2001) was the first film I watched from Shunji Iwai, I went in blind not knowing what his films were like, only going based of stills on Twitter. I felt the movie really touched on the forum experience of the early 2000’s and really integrated that into the movie through its overlapping text.\n\nLooking over other well known japanese film, Iwai’s work makes several appearance, and I wanted to see how his work developed, I ony knew him from this one movie and wanted to go back to the beginning, his interest in the nostaglia and how he selected music resonated with me.\n\nI am excited to continue, especially adding more songs to my spotify.\n\nNext Up, is *Love Letter (1995)*\n\n# Filmography\n\n***Omelette (1992)***  \n***Fried Dragon Fish (1993)***  \n***Fireworks, Should We See it from the Side or the Bottom? (1993)***  \n***Undo (1994)***  \n***Kyrie (2023)***\n\n# Shuji Terayama (7 films)\n\nThe Cage (1964)\n\nPoet, playwright, novelist, photographer, sports critic, filmmaker and cultural agent provocateur Shuji Terayama (1935–1983) was among the most broadly influential and innovative figures active in the post-WWII Japanese avant-garde. Throughout his all-too-brief but astonishingly prolific and multifaceted career, Terayama deliberately confused boundaries between high and low, between history and myth, while working inventively across different media. Terayama’s intermingling of theater, film and photography was an especially important inspiration for his visionary art practice. Beginning with his precocious and often controversial engagement with traditional *tanka* poetry as a mere teen, Terayama held tight to his belief that genuine artistic creativity was rooted in the act of shattering molds in order to cast them anew.¹\n\n***Filmography***  \n***The Cage (1964)***  \n***The War of Jan-Ken-Pon (1971)***  \n***Laura (1974)***  \n***Young Person’s Guide to Cinema (1974)***  \n***Labyrinth Tale (1975)***  \n***The Woman with Two Heads (1977)***\n\nNext Up, is *Pastoral: To Die in the Country (1974)*\n\n# Tsai Ming Liang (4 films)\n\nVive L’Amour (1994)\n\n***Filmography***  \n***Rebels of the Neon God (1992)***  \n***Vive L’Amour (1994)***  \n***My New Friend (1995)***  \n***Days (2020)***\n\n*Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003)* stands as my #1 all time movie, I was deeply moved by it, the dialogue is beyond minimal in what I thought could be possible. Watching *King Hu’s Dragon Inn (1967)* elevated the movie even more for me, beyond being a classic of the wuxia genre, to combine it with act of transportation we all encounter in going to the cinema. That final scene between the two elder men, witnessing their youth through the movie, the passage of time.\n\nDays (2020)\n\nHis earlier film, Tsai still hadn’t yet dove into slow cinema but you can see that he is slowly building and what he would be known for. The most recent film of his I watched, was *“Days” (2020)*, took his minimalism even further, in which only dialogue that needed translation was subtitled, showing how a whole conversation was without subtitle because it wasnt necessary but to be taken on the journey of two men. Their daily lives until the meet up with each other, and then return back to their lives, with what felt like less than 10 mins of dialogue but nothing is lost because dialogue is sparse, you can feel all the emotion through what is depicted.\n\nNext Up, is *The River (1997)*\n\n# Toshio Matsumoto (5 films)\n\nThe Weavers of Nishijin (1961)\n\nMatusmoto’s was one of the first introduction into experimental film, I found him through an account on twitter that posted their own list of experimental cinema, started with Matsumoto’s *Atman (1975),* I continued and fell in love with *Phantom (1975)* and the incredible *Funeral Parade for Roses (1969).*\n\nI’ve watched a lot of his experimental films, some I loved and other that didnt resonate but most of all, I enjoyed the exploration of how he wanted to play with the medium.\n\nFinal Films —*Demons (1971) &amp; Dogra Magra (1988)*\n\n***Filmography***  \n***The Weavers of Nishijin (1961)***  \n***The Song of Stone (1963)***  \n***Relation (1982)***  \n***1986 Summer (1986)***  \n***Engram (1987)***\n\n# Suprises\n\n*Duvidha — Mani Kual (1973)*\n\n*Petit Maman — Celine Sciamma (2021)*\n\n*You Hide Me — Kwate Owoo (1970)*\n\n*The Ghoul — Sodsri Phakdeecht (1940)*\n\n*Dragon Inn — King Hu (1967)*\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1.

    "content": "I hope this is ok to post here. I never had any luck getting an answer to this in r/tipofmytongue, so maybe someone here knows the film I'm talking about. \n\nI'm trying to remember the name of a movie I saw in my \"New Asian Cinema\" college class back in the mid 2000s. I don't remember much, except for a scene where a teacher is handing back tests to students, but he crumples up the bad graded ones and throws them out an upper story window. I'm pretty sure it was a comedy, and involved a family at home...but that's all I can remember. It's likely from the early 2000s (no later than 2005, since I took the class then), but it may be from the late 90s. \n\nOne fun thing about this was that our teacher did pretty much the same thing early on in the year. (Except he crumpled up the tests of students that got 100% and tossed them off to the side of the room.) We had no idea why he did that for a month or so. When we finally saw this movie in class and that scene came on, the whole class burst into laughter. It was funny that he let us question why he did that for so long before finally letting us in on the joke.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the help! Hope it rings a bell with someone!",

And the reason it stuck in brain is because how nice the florist is when she arrange the new combination of flowers for the young man. The florist herself is not even an important character in the movie/drama I believe, yet she put a lot of thought on putting the flower combination for the young man. And I believe the young man is one of the main character from the movie/drama.\n\nThe movie/drama itself I think around mid 2000's. Not the most popular one out there I believe. If anyone know what movie/drama it is please tell me. \n\nThank you in advance. ",

I woke up in the middle of the night with the TV on, and a film was playing, I only saw this one scene and I don't remember there being any conversation. it was an Asian man and woman, the man was lying still, lifeless or maybe unconsciously on a white table, or platform and the lady was straddled on top of him. they weren't having sex. from what it looked like the lady was kissing or crying and just caressing his body from his head down to his torso after that I fell back to sleep. it was less erotic and more emotional I think and of course, I know I was too young to have glimpsed this scene as a child but I think that is why the image has stayed with me .at first I thought the film was in the realm of sense, but after further investigating im don't think it is.

First one made sometime before ~~1950, I think~~ (\\[I was wrong, turned out to be 1956\\]). I believe I watched all three but I cannot remember the title and I am having a terrible time finding it.\n\nPlot: A poor girl works as maid for household in small/poor village. The father of household wants to be higher status. A prince from nearby village wants a bride but only one who is not a gold digger (I do not remember but he might have already seen the main girl somewhere and went to this village for her especially but did not say who he was looking for.) At the end, the father's daughter who was arranged to marry the Prince switches with the poor girl and the poor girl marries the Prince. The Prince tells the poor girl he wants her and all is well.\n\nOther stuff: This movie is an old movie and is often (I thought often) done as a high school play in Korea. I think it is a comedy and a musical, lots of singing anyway. There are three versions of the movie. The actor who plays the main girl's father in the first movie also plays the same character in the third movie (meaning the second remake). They wear old style clothing.\n\nThank you for your help!",

    "content": "I remember watching this movie in the 2000s but I'm pretty sure it's older its an asian war movie in that dynasty era style where the soldiers are on horse back and use spears, swords, bow &amp; arrow. The plot is these brothers are all fighting together but then they each get killed by the enemy. The father hits his head on a giant gong after an argument. One of them was blinded by a giant mirror and was killed, another was stabbed by multiple spears, another one died from a shower of arrows and he props himself with his spear to die upright. I remember one scene where one of the brother was leading an army and tried to confuse the enemy by having their horses run in different directions with gear tied behind scraping the ground to make some loud noise.

There’s a different sensibility compared to most Western films—sometimes more subtle, sometimes more raw.\n\nAny recommendations for where to go next? I’m into both emotional dramas and intense thrillers, and I’m open to indie films or lesser-known gems too. Any country works: Japan, South Korea, China, Thailand, India…\n\nBonus points if you can share why the film made an impact on you. Thanks in advance—I’m ready to expand my watchlist!",

Years later he is back and ends up meeting the woman but doesn't recognise her until the end. There is a love triangle as the woman's younger room mate likes him. The other details I remember is the man takes a job advertising \"darkie\" toothpaste, and the woman's room mate wins a modelling competition (by accident as she turns up for the wrong job interview).\n\nThe other scene I remember is a comedic scene where people leave the iron on the ironing board for too long and it melts through the board. I am certain the language was mandarin, although it could have very well been dubbed into it (if say it was a Hong Kong production).\n\nI don't really know the actors or director.",

    "content": "Hello, I’m really sorry if my English is not good but i’m looking for a movie I saw a long time ago, and I was left intrigued, wanting to know what would happen next.\n\nI hope someone can help me find it. I don’t remember much about this movie, but it seems like it shows a marriage with a lot of problems at home. The husband is always hitting his wife, and she is always afraid of him. They also have a daughter who, I think, is in high school, and she isn’t physically abused by her father. However, I think she had problems with her mother.\nOne day, the woman, fed up with the beatings, I think, hit her husband and killed him with a glass table or something like that. I remember the death involved glass. Afterward, the woman and her daughter are in shock and crying. After some time, they decide to start a new life together in a new place, where the woman meets a man who is younger than her. This man had a crush on her and would occasionally flirt with her\n\nLater, we see that they formed a relationship, and apparently, the daughter didn’t like the man very much, as she was somewhat distant with him. In one outing they had, which happened because the girl skipped school and he was going to work, they ran into each other in a train carriage, and that’s when they started seeing each other. I’m not sure how they began a secret relationship behind the mother’s back, but every time she went to work, the two of them stayed together.\n\nThe last thing I saw in the movie was that one day, as the woman was heading to work, she forgot something at home and quickly went back. But she started hearing strange noises from inside. The woman, confused, went to investigate what was making the noise and found her husband and daughter in a room, having sex.\nThat’s all I remember about the movie. If anyone knows what it is, I would really appreciate it if you could let me know 😔 I was really intrigued to know what happened next.\nThanks ",

    "content": "Films don’t just tell stories—they invite us to step into a world we’ve never seen before. They take us beyond what we know, immersing us in the past, the future, or a reality that challenges us to think differently.\n\nFor the first time, a Nepali period drama is blending history with groundbreaking technology. [JAAR,](http://www.jaarmovie.com/) inspired by Indra Bahadur Rai’s timeless short story, is more than a historical film—it’s a bridge between past and future, tradition and innovation.\n\nIt’s set in 19th-century Nepal, a time and place rarely explored in cinema. The film features Nepal’s first-ever CGI-VFX tiger, proving that storytelling can evolve without losing its soul. Shot in untouched landscapes, it preserves history while making it feel alive. In cinema, every new technique—color, sound, CGI—was once questioned. But the best stories find a way to balance innovation with emotional depth.\n\nWhat’s a film that did this brilliantly? One that used technology not just for spectacle, but to serve the story? Let’s talk.\n\n\\#WorldCinema #JAAR #CGIinFilm #Storytelling #PeriodDrama\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fk43g933ktme1.jpg?width=1134&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44e1d9e24d5083770c6aa592c615c91aee83f24d\n\nlatest song unveiled.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wDXMkh1xGQ&amp;ab\\_channel=FERRYTALEPICTURES  \n",

The person obviously came out of a window from high up.\n\nAlso in the movie there is another female who has a burnt Teddy Bear that she refuses to get rid of. At the end of the movie you find out that she was in the room when the other female caught fire and jumped out the window and her bear got burned in the resulting fire in the room.",

I also vaguely remember a scene where **water falls onto the bed** while she is being filmed.\n\nI believe this is more of a **drama** rather than a thriller. The movie seems to be about **her personal journey** rather than a romantic or traditional plot. It likely came out **after 2010**.\n\nIf anyone recognizes this film, please let me know the title.

    "title": "A year in Film - 2024",
    "content": "Last year I embarked on a film journey, a lot of it was focused on asian cinema, by christmas i reached 255 films, something I didnt think it would have been possible at the beginning of the year. I decided to write about it on my blog and noticed a few trends within my experience, I wanted to share it here, and happy for anyone to suggest anything films I should look into after seeing what ive watched. It is a long post, i hope everyone enjoy what I found in my year of film.\n\n# 1. Year with Satyajit Ray\n\nPather Panchali/Song of the Little Road (1955)  \nAparajito/The Unvanquished (1956)  \nApur Sansar/The World of Apu (1959)  \nTwo(1964)  \nKapurush/ The Coward (1965)\n\nWith every film from the Apu trilogy, I was left heartbroken by the life of Apu, the death of his sister, his parents, his wife and him losing himself in the final trilogy. Abandoning his son due to the inconsolable grief from the death of his wife. For me, it cemented itself deep within my mind, the journey in which we see Apu develop resonated deeply, and it stands as a invaluable work of cinema from the Master Satyajit Ray.\n\nKapurush was a film, so modern in its excution and simplicity, I was astounded watching this. The story of deep regret and cowardice, masterful in the dialogue between actors. In the final scene, we see Amitahba Roy in a last ditch attempt at love with his former lover only to be absolutely shattered beyond belief as the scene lingers on his face and we get to see the light leave his eyes. To live with regret and to be reminded of that moment of cowardice, in which he lost what he held dear when he was young.\n\n“Not to have seen the cinema of Satyajit Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.” ― Akira Kurosawa\n\n# 2. Exploring Apichatpong “Joe” Weerasethakul Filmography\n\nTropical Malady (2004)  \nSyndrome and a Century (2006)  \nThe Anthem (2006)  \nAshes (2012)  \nFireworks (Archives) (2014)  \nCemetery of Splendour (2015)  \nSkyping after an earthquake/Monsoon (2017)\n\nIn my early 20s, I watched the seminal film “Uncle Boonme Who Can Recall His Past Lives”, It left a mark on my mind on films, it wasn’t until about 10+ years later that I returned to this film and still felt that impact. This year, I traced my steps in finding as many works as i could of Weerasethakul’s filmography including his short films. I have much more ground to cover as Joe, is a very prolific director.\n\nHis films have always captivated me by their dream like form, Joe, melds so many themes into his films, mixing thai lore with pointed looks at militarism in the country. Cemetery of Splendour uses both these themes in its plot line, a movie about soldiers who have fallen into a coma, in which a battle between ancient kings absorb their energy to continue this endless battle.\n\nThere is a slowness in which Joe shots certain scenes, that lets the moment linger that really speaks to me, from this I have been slowly looking at other directors that have a similar sensibilities. Gravitating into slow cinema and seeing how others directors use this format, of letting space linger, letting it hold weight as we simply watch.\n\n# 3. Year in Thailand — Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit, Pen-ek Ratanaruang, Tran Anh Hung\n\n**Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit**  \n\\-36 (2012)  \n\\-Mary is Happy, Mary is Happy (2013)  \n\\-Heart Attack (2015)  \n\\-Souvenir (2018)  \n\\-6 Takes of Drama (2020)  \n\\-Filter (2022)\n\n**Pen-ek Ratanaruang** — Last Life in the Universe (2003)  \n**Tran Anh Hung** — The Scent of Green Papaya (1993)\n\nThis year, I moved beyond Weerasethakul filmography when looking at Thai cinema, it hard to not avoid the giants but I wanted to know what else is happening. I came across Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit, Pen-ek Ratanaruang and Tran Anh Hung. Each with their own style of directing.\n\nMost Surprising was Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit’s \\*\\*“\\*\\*Mary is Happy, Mary is Happy”, it was fun and enjoyable seeing the dialogue between two bestfriends in their last days of school, their tweets adding to the storyline, non sensical rants do add a lot of fun, it reminded me of “Shunji Iwai -All about Lily Chou-Chou” inclusion of message boards text. We are left with thoughts of the two friends who at the end, the admittance of “Mary is (not) Happy”.\n\n# 4. Year in Japan — Short list\n\nI really did focus a lot on Japanese Cinema, still hold many gaps in its filmography but I was able to enjoy a lot coming out of Japan. Below will be cliff notes version of all the movies I enjoyed.\n\n\\-Branded to Kill — Seijun Suzuki (1964)  \n\\-For the Damaged Right Eye — Toshio Matsumoto (1968)  \n\\-Funeral Parade for Flowers — Toshio Matsumoto (1969)  \n\\-Go, Go, Second Time Virgin — Koji Wakamatsu (1969)\n\n\\-The Bathroom — Yoji Kuri (1970)  \n\\-Throw Away Your Books, Rally in the Streets — Shuji Terayama (1971)  \n\\-In the Realm of the Sense — Nagisa Oshima (1976)  \n\\-Thunder — Takashi Ito (1982)\n\n\\-I’ve Heard the Ammonite Murmur — Isao Yamada (1992)  \n\\-Cure — Kiyoshi Kurosawa (1997)  \n\\-Glassy Ocean — Shigeru Tamura (1998)  \n\\-All About Lily Chou-Chou — Shunji Iwai (2001)\n\n\\-Girl Orphie — Isao Yamada (2001)  \n\\-Linda Linda Linda — Nobuhiko Yamashita (2005)  \n\\-Shin Godzilla — Hideaki Anno, Shiji Higuchi (2016)  \n\\-Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy — Ryusuke Hamaguchi (2021)\n\n\\-Monster — Hirokazu Kore-Eda (2023)  \n\\-Chime — Kiyoshi Kurosawa (2024)  \n\\-Look Back — Kiyotaka Oshiyama (2024)  \n\\-The Boy and the Heron — Hayao Miyazaki (2024)\n\n# 5. Kidlat Tahamik — Perfumed Nightmare (1977)\n\nI heard about this one, and it did not disappoint, Kidlat Tahamik known as the Father of Filipino New Wave, this anti-colonial film focuses on Kidlat, who’s dream is to work for NASA and build a bridge to the stars. We learn of his desire to go to the United States, that everything is in abundance in the US. His Mother speaks to him of his father who was serenaded by the white mans lies, and fought for independence only to be captured by another entity, speaking “For twelve million dollars they bought your soul and mine.” Kidlat later is taken to Paris as a worker for an American “businessman”, realizing that the civilized world offers nothing, the same problems of the village persist, as the village loses craftmans, the city loses farmers to industrialization. Being in Paris only illuminates that the same issues that persist across the world.\n\nKidlat ends the film, speaking of his independence. Imagining another world.\n\n# 6. China, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan — Notables\n\nA lot of this year focus was on Japenese Cinema, But this is a list of gems I’ve found acress Asian Cinema. Still short list but as 2025 continues I will work on expanding my knowledge of film in the region.\n\n**China**  \n\\-Kaili Blues — Bi Gan (2015)  \n\\-Long Day’s Journey into Night — Bi Gan (2018)  \n\\-A Short Story — Bi Gan (2022)\n\n**Hong Kong**  \n\\-Comrade, A Love Story — Peter Chan (1996)-Made in Hong Kong — Fruit Chan (1997)  \n\\-Spacked Out — Lawrence Ah Mon (2000)\n\n**Korea**  \n\\-List — Hong Sang Soo (2011)  \n\\-50:50 — Hong Sang Soo (2013)  \n\\-On the Beach at Night Alone — Hong Sang Soo (2017)  \n\\-The Woman Who Ran — Hong Sang Soo (2020)\n\n**Taiwan**  \n\\-Millenium Mambo — Hou Hsiao Hsien (2001)  \n\\-Goodbye, Dragon Inn — Tsai Ming Liang (2003)\n\n# 7. Personal Faves\n\n**The Brothers Quay**  \n\\-This Unnameable Little Broom (1985)  \n\\-Street of Crocodiles (1986)  \n\\-Rehearsals for Extinct Anatomies (1987)  \n\\-The Comb (1990)  \n\\-Eurydice (2007)\n\nThe Brothers Quay, the inspiration behind many Tool videos, I found their work through a film account on twitter and it did not disappoint, absolutely stunned at the work and care that I found within “Street of Crocodiles”. Stop Motion being very labor intensive, but the end results from these masters of the medium produces a story unlike any other. As I was writing this, saw news article about a new film from the Brothers Quay, the first in 20 years. Excited to see what their new work is like.\n\n**Ibrahim Shaddad (Sudanese Film Group)**  \n\\-A Camel (1981)  \n\\-The Rope (1984)  \n\\-Human Being (1994)\n\nSudanese Film Group, truly a gem, introduced to this group through a limited run on [https://monangambee.org](https://monangambee.org/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaa9CrHN6mhH_pIB8Cr5QUzDIgV5hmwuW9BcB35YJRCfPZPkl61ywN-yKaM_aem_zaItwhyWpBKqnQL9xv5vTg) by my friend Johann, luckily I was able to watch all 3 film at the deadline, as the final film was cut off 5 mins before ending. Luck lead me to find it on Youtube. This is one of the most surprising discoveries of the year, I am always eager to find something completely outside of my current line of thinking, and remind of how exciting and politically sharp other are across the world working with film as a medium of expressing daily life, history but also political realities in a change world.\n\nWhat this group was able to accomplish, will not be forgotten, as I continue to look for the documentary on the group ‘Talking about Trees”.\n\n**The Night of Counting the Years — Shadi Abdel Salam (1969)**\n\nConsidered the best out of Egyptian Cinema, this movie is working on so many levels. Synopsis below, but highly recommend watching this:\n\n“Set in 1881, a year before the start of British colonial rule, it is based on the true story of the Abd el-Rasuls, an Upper-Egyptian clan that had been robbing a cache of mummies they have discovered at tomb DB320 near the village of Kurna, and selling the artifacts on the black market. After a conflict within the clan, one of its members made a crucial decision when the Antiquities Service arrived.”\n\n# 8. Young Directors — Mati Diop, Payal Kapadia and Rungano Nyoni\n\n**Mati Diop — Dahomey (2024)**  \nI am very excited by all three of these young directors, Mati Diop being the most recent one to release a new film “Dahomey”, a powerful tackling the return of priceless items from the Kingdom of Dahomey from France, only 26 items were return out of hundreds. The film is at times narrated by one of the old gods, stolen during French Invasion of 1892 and their feelings on returning. Another aspect is seeing these artifacts being installed in a new museum in Benin while also most pivotal aspect, the dialogue of what it means, to everyone, to students, teachers, historians, clashing ideas of how to reshape history going forward. Truly one of the best of the Year.\n\nDahomey\n\n**Payal Kapadia**  \nWatermelon, Fish and Half Ghost (2014)  \nThe Last Mango Before the Monsoon (2015)  \nAfternoon Clouds (2017)  \nAnd What is the Summer Saying (2018)\n\nPayal Kapadia, I have yet to watch her most recent work, “All We Imagined as Light”, but exploring her earlier films, and surprisingly didnt noticed how “A Night of Knowing Nothing”, one of my favorite films was directed by her. I soon, looked into her earlier works and they did not disappoint, also reading how she focused on Weerasethakul’s “Mysterious Objects at Noon” as her Master’s Thesis, brought me more intrigue to her work.\n\nThis year, I started taking notes, on influences of past directors and more contemporary directors, exploring a direction of works that I gravitate towards.\n\n**Rungano Nyoni — I am Not a Witch (2017)**\n\n‘I am Not a Witch” a film that touches on the Witch Camps in Zambia, is the debut film from Rungano Nyoni, impressive start, they collaborated with David Gallego who did the cinematography for Ciro Guerra’s “Embrace of the Serpent” and “Bird of Passage” to create a beautiful film.\n\nTheir most recent release is “On Becoming a Guinea Fowl\\*\\*”\\*\\*, awaiting MUBI to upload it to the platform.\n\n# 9. Surprises in 2024\n\n**Marta Rodriguez &amp; Jorge Silva**  \n\\-Chircales (1972)  \n\\-Campesinos (1975)\n\nRecent additions to MUBI, a focus on the Colombian peasant class during 1960–1970’s, incredible documentaries from the duo. These two short documentaries should not be missed.\n\n“”In the hands of a landowner, backed by a regime, the brickmakers escape all labour control or statistics.”  \n\\-Chircales(1972), Marta Rodríguez, Jorge Silva.\n\n**Possession — Andrzej Żuławski (1981)**\n\nWatched this twice this year, and both times, nothing but joy as we see the descent into madness from Ana and Mark, and everyone involved with the both of them. It solidify is placement in my All Time Top 20.\n\n**This is an Address — Sasha Wortzel (2020)**\n\nThis short film documentary was one of the most haunting features of the year, focusing on\n\n“Stonewall veterans (including prominent trans activist Sylvia Rivera) and HIV-positive New Yorkers take up residency on the Hudson River piers as cranes raze vacant buildings for a new skyline.”\n\nIt brings up the topic of living, a condemnation of houseless population that live on the edge of society but can not rebuild their lives as the necessity of “an address” is fundamental to interact with the structures of government. Containing a sharp knife at the way we abandon those who need the most help.\n\n# 10. Goodbye, Dragon Inn\n\nThis absolutely became my favorite film of the year, hands down. A meditative look at the last showing at a local cinema, with its final film being “Dragon Inn (1967)”.\n\nTsai Ming Liang, was a director whose name among countless other stood out, my selection for watching movies are always decide with 10 minutes of watching. I believe mood may ruin a good movie, if its not the right time. I am glad to have been able to have watched this, hoping one day to return and see it in a theater.\n\nI will need to rewatch this again, but it left me speechless. A movie about watching movies.\n\nThank you 2024.",

I struggle finding a Japanese drama that would suit my taste, so I was wondering if you have any suggestions. I really like historical pieces, (modern can work too though) I prefer easy going light dramas, they don't have to be realistic, but I would prefer something mythical with deep folklore over just plain magic or robots. Dramas I really like include: \nCDrama \"New Life Begins\" \nCDrama \"Guardians of the Dafeng\"\nKDrama \"Another miss Oh\" \nKDrama \"Let’s eat\"\nKDrama \"Marriage Not Dating\" \nKDrama \"Because this is My First Life\"\n\nJDrama I watched but found it so so were \"Mischevious Kiss: Love in Tokyo\" and \"Absolute Boyfriend\" \n\nI am especially in love with the Chinese dramas I mentioned so if you know of anything similarly styled but Japanese I would really love for you to share your suggestions! Thank you in advance! No suggestion is wrong, I rather check it out than miss out on something good. \n\n",

This series is just so epically made to be a perfect game, full of different sects and factions and clans and so on and lots of difficult choices. Would love to see something like...

Basically there was this teenage girl who wanted to fulfill her aunts wish of letting her old high school lover know she always had feelings for him. During that time she runs into the old high school lovers son and they go on a journey together. The movie switches between present time and the past. In the past the aunt was a nerdy girl and the love interest was a very popular guy. I think he pretended she was his gf or something like that. They eventually began to develop feelings for each other but they break it off because the aunt has a life threatening disease but by the end of the movie it’s cured. This is all I can remember, sorry if it’s super confusing, it was like 2 1/2 hours and I watched it a long time ago. \n\nIf anyone knows what I’m talking about please help me!!

The guy on the other line supported her. Turns out that guy was set up on many blind dates for marriage by his mom. I don't recall how exactly but those two end up meeting and of course fall in love.
