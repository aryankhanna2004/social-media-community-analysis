    "content": "So I’m already stressing about getting tickets for BTS’s upcoming arena tour. While I’m waiting\r\nfor tour dates to be announced, I started thinking about how to get tickets for big-name tours in\r\ngeneral. Every time I try for big shows, I end up in the virtual queue for an hour only to see\r\n“platinum” or resale listings pop up before I even get through.\n\r\nI’m fine paying face value, it just feels like it’s impossible to get decent seats anymore unless\r\nyou have some kind of presale magic. I’ve never really tried to get presale tickets, it seems\r\ncomplicated. But with rumors about this tour, I want to up my game.\n\r\nIf you’ve managed to score good seats for major arena shows, HOW did you do it?\n\r\nWhat insider tricks should I know before the next wave of tour announcements drops?\n\r\nLast time I gave up and watched TikToks from the nosebleeds.\n\r\nI don’t want to do that again! Please help.",

If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1oc0vdk/the_popheads_charts_october_20th_2025_fancy_some/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

    "content": "I feel like there is a lot of discussion on this subreddit about songwriting and production credits, but I feel like we very rarely talk about pop artists who are genuinely talented instrumentalists and can compose nice tracks. Or, people who could sit down with an instrument and play it in the studio for their own and for other people's records. Or artists who play instruments outside of their own live performances and are in bands for other artists or play gigs for other artists.\n\nOn the top of my head I can think of these pop and pop adjacent artists:\n\n1. Billie Eilish: Played keyboards and synths on her last album\n\n2. Natalie Mering aka Weyes Blood: She played the guitar and piano on In The Darkness, Hearts Aglow.\n\n3. Haim: Danielle and Alana play the guitar on all Haim records, Alana does the keys on all of them, and Este does the Bass and they all play drums on their records.\n\n4. St. Vincent: She's otherworldly, she played almost everything but strings and wind instruments on her first two albums, and she plays the guitars and synths on her newer albums.\n\n5. Bruno Mars: He played the guitars and other plucked instruments on An Evening with Silk Sonic\n\n6. Laufey: She plays Cello and Piano on her records.",

    "content": "It is very rare for me to rate an album 10/10, but there are a few exceptions. However,there are albums that came close if it wasn’t for that one song that doesn’t compare to the other ones. I sill say Thank U Next is a perfect album without “Make up”, that just don’t compare but it’s still my favorite Ariana album.\n\nWhat about you? What are some songs that would be perfect if not for that one or few songs?",

    "title": "15 years ago, Taylor Swift released Speak Now",
    "content": "On October 25, 2010, Taylor Swift released her album [Speak Now](https://imgur.com/a/5nzoisQ ). The album was Swift’s third album and her follow up to her mega successful album Fearless. Swift wrote the album by herself (with the exception of If This Was A Movie). The album mostly about heartbreak and reflections on broken relationships, and some tracks were inspired by Swift’s rising stardom in the public eye to address her critics and adversaries. \n\n5 singles were released from the standard version of the album and six overall (one single is from the deluxe edition of the album). [Mine](https://youtu.be/XPBwXKgDTdE) was the first single from the album and would become the album’s biggest hit peaking at #3 on the Hot 100 and #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart. The second single [Back to December](https://youtu.be/QUwxKWT6m7U) would peak at #6 on the Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot Country Songs charts. The third single [Mean](https://youtu.be/jYa1eI1hpDE) would peak at #11 on the Hot 100 and #2 on the Hot Country Songs charts. [The Story of Us](https://youtu.be/nN6VR92V70M) would peak at #41 on the Hot 100.

    "content": "With the new release of Demi Lovato, I’ve been thinking about how there’s a big difference between artists who experiment because they want to vs artists who experiment because they don’t know what to stick with yet.\n\nSome artists change their sound or genre every album, but it always feels intentional — like they’re just having fun or exploring new ideas. Some clear examples this are Madonna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift. Each era sounds different, but it still feels like them. You can tell they’re confident in the chaos.\n\nThen there are artists who also switch it up a lot, but it feels more like they’re searching for something that clicks. It’s not necessarily a bad thing — but you can kinda tell when someone isn't really confident with their sound yet. They’re trying pop one album, alt the next, maybe a dance single after that, and it just doesn’t connect in the same way. That is exactly how I personally with Demi. I do listen to Demi a lot but I also do feel like she doesn't really know what to do and tries to somehow follow the current trend with each of her albums. Her run from Teen-Rock to Pop to EDM to R&amp;B to Hard Rock to Dance doesn't feel smooth to me.\n\nIt’s interesting because on the surface both types of artists are “experimenting,” but the intention behind it feels totally different. One is curiosity and growth, the other is uncertainty and trial-and-error.\n\nWhat are some examples of artists you think like trying new stuff vs artists who are still figuring out who they are sonically?",

    "content": "A little game inspired by some cute and compelling-in-hindsight reviews I've been reading recently—post as a top-level comment a review or article quote about an artist **made 10 years ago or earlier,** and we'll all see if we can guess to whom it refers.\n\nI will start us off with three different artists whose names I'm sure everyone here knows...\n\n&gt;*The music industry’s collapse may have seemed like a dress rehearsal for the current financial meltdown, but there are still stars in the business, and there is an interesting trend in both number and gender: the popular groups are male—Nickelback, Coldplay, the Eagles. The solo stars now, though, are more likely to be women: Alicia Keys, Carrie Underwood, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and* ***\\[Artist A\\]*** *(who probably won’t need that surname for long). Her self-titled début album, released when she was sixteen, has been on the charts for two years. It is triple platinum and still rests, impressively, at No. 31 on the Billboard 200. \\[She\\] wrote or co-wrote every song on the album, one when she was twelve. ...\\[Artist A\\] is not an agent of revolution; she, much like Beyoncé, is a preternaturally skilled student of established values. Her precociousness isn’t about her chart success, but lies in the quality of her work, how fully she’s absorbed the lessons of her elders and how little she seems to care which radio format will eventually claim her. Change the beat and the instruments around the voice, and her songs could work anywhere.*\n\n—From an article on Artist A's rise by Sasha Frere-Jones for the New Yorker\n\n&gt;*The teenage heartthrob who cut through the fourth-quarter clutter with the pop/R&amp;B single \\[\"Lead Single\"\\] delivers her debut album, a top 40-ready workout filled with hook-laden songs from the same bag as the title cut. Blessed with a sweet voice and a wholesome, girl-next-door image,* ***\\[Artist B\\]*** *has hit a nerve among a teen fan base primed by the likes of Hanson, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys... Although much of the world will be introduced to \\[Artist B\\] by this album, she already tasted the limelight in a two-year run on \\[television show\\]. A talent to watch.*\n\n—Billboard review of Artist B's debut album\n\n&gt;*I actually enjoy a good portion of this album. It's a bubblegum pop record that includes some infectious music that make you want to sing along to at high volumes. Some of the material is just throwaway junk but not too many albums don't include crappy filler. The title track is one of the good ones along with the monster single \\[\"Lead Single\"\\] and one of my favorite songs this year \\[\"Second Single\"\\]. If* ***\\[Artist C\\]*** *can continue to write music like these tracks she will have nice little career ahead of her.*\n\n&gt;*She will probably never achieve the hysteria of \\[\"Lead Single\"\\] but she's not going to be a Toni Basil. She's got at minimum five hit singles on this platter and a couple of them have staying power long past their run on pop radio. I would compare this album to Pink's excellent M!ssundaztood or Ashlee Simpson's Autobiography. Not groundbreaking but fun and infectious the way music needs to be sometimes.*\n\n—RateYourMusic review of Artist C's debut major-label album\n\nSee if you can guess the artists above, and post your own redacted quotes below so I can guess yours \\^\\_\\_\\^",

    "content": "Welcome back to the Popheads Jukebox! Here are [the results from last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1o2j7tz/the_popheads_jukebox_revival_week_327_where_is_my/):\n\n* RAYE - WHERE IS MY HUSBAND!: 9.39\n* Madison Beer - yes baby: 7.64\n* XG - GALA: 7.64\n* Miley Cyrus - Secrets (feat. Lindsey Buckingham &amp; Mick Fleetwood): 7.17\n* Allie X - Is Anybody Out There?: 5.25\n\n-\n\n* Adele - Hello: 8.17\n\n\n###Rules Refresher\n\n1. Rate the songs a score from 1 to 10. Please keep it to one decimal place at the most (so 7.5 is fine but 7.58 is not). Also don’t get too hung up on the final scores. This is a fun exercise and not a competition so don’t worry about over/under rating things. Just give what you think the song is to you.\n\n2. For your review, reply to the comment that will be posted by one of us for each song. Avoid posting your reviews as a top level comment cause we probably won’t notice them if you do. Non-reviews such as questions or general commentary as upper level comments are fine.\n\n3. Must have some sort of justification. Try to be a bit more concise than “It’s a bop!” or “I don’t like it”. Explain why! It doesn’t have to be long, two or three sentences can be plenty (though more is definitely allowed). We reserve the right not to include a review in the final total if proper justification is not given.\n\n4. You don’t have to review each song to participate! You can do all of them or only the ones you’re familiar with.\n\n5. The thread will be open for 13 days and close in two Wednesdays around 11PM EST. The scores will be calculated and a new post will come up the next day (Thursday) at 5PM EST(ish) with the next week’s tracks.\n\n---\n\n###This Week’s Tracks\n\n* **[Khalid - out of body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXXgp8XP1E)**\n* **[Magdalena Bay - Second Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAe2faaZ3sY)**\n* **[Taylor Swift - The Fate of Ophelia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko70cExuzZM)**\n* **[Victoria Justice - Love Zombie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-S91K81NRk)**\n* **[Zara Larsson - Midnight Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvY8fdgezLQ)**\n\nThrowback\n\n* **[Justin Bieber - Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRh_vgS2dFE)**\n\n\n—\n\n\n###Next Week\n\n* Doja Cat - Gorgeous\n* Kim Petras - I Like Ur Look\n* Oklou - viscus (feat.

    "title": "Anyone remembers Birdy and Gabrielle Aplin?",
    "content": "I remember back in the first half of the 2010s there was a small but still influential trend of pop ballads leaning towards melodic folk, with artists like Birdy, Gabrielle Aplin, Tom Odell, James Bay, George Ezra, Kodaline, Aurora, Daughter, and Lauren Aquilina. Quite a good number of artists, most of them from the UK (for some reason, British singers always seem more romantic than American ones). The ones that stood out the most for me were the first two: Birdy and Gabrielle Aplin. Both were very young when they became famous. They were pretty much the epitome of the English roses that history and literature books talk about.\n\nI was very young back then too, still a teenager, and when I found out about them, I immediately fell in love with their music. I was still an emo kid, listening to post-hardcore bands like Bring Me the Horizon and Sleeping with Sirens, but when I felt sad and alone, I would open YouTube and tune into their melodic, introspective songs. They always made me feel better. It was my dream back then to attend one of their concerts, to travel to England, and enjoy the English rain. It never happened. Years passed, I became more depressed, and all the big dreams I had -- becoming a poet, a novelist, a musician -- went nowhere. Then the pandemic came and made everything worse. I dropped out of college twice but finally got a degree, and suddenly it was already 2025, and I was 30. For some reason, this autumn -- with its early darkness and distant, fading sun -- made me think of them again. They were around my age, but after their first two albums, it seems like they either stopped making music or never found the same success.\n\nSo, what happened to them? Are there any new musicians in this decade who resemble their sound, that pop, indie-folk magic that mesmerized us with sweet, melodic vocals and that unmistakable British accent that felt straight out of a Jane Austen novel? Is it possible that I could finally become a musician and honor them, releasing an indie folk album that would become a big success? And in some future interview, I would mention them as my main influences, and thank them for making music more poetic, intimate and sincere?",

I can only assume this is because less people are going out to clubs, malls, partys, third spaces as they use too.. so is this the new normal for pop?",

I could see some parallels with pop music and religion: \n\n1) people have unrealistic expectations of their pop girlies to be politically responsible and woke even though humans are not perfect (like the uplifted, pedestaled pastor who gets caught cheating).\n\n2) When you do hear the right song that hits you right, it feels euphoric and you can’t stop playing it over and over (my most recent ones are By the End of the Night by Amber Mark, The Subway, twilight zone, Shapeshifting on a Saturday Night). It almost feels spiritual to have the melodies or lyrics or tone of a voice hit u in that right way. \n\n3) when you sing in a crowd at a concert, it feels akin to a worship night at church. You feel like a part of something bigger and it’s awesome. \n\nWhat are some other ways pop music parallels religion?",

According to a statement, the album “traces a widescreen emotional arc of feminine mystique, transformation, and transcendence — moving between intimacy and operatic scale to create a radiant world where sound, language, and culture fuse as one.”\n\nWhile it’s unclear which songs will feature guests, the press release confirms that the record will include Björk, Portuguese fado singer Carminho, Spanish flamenco star Estrella Morente, Spanish singer Silvia Pérez Cruz, música mexicana star Yahritza, and experimental musician Yves Tumor. The boys choir Escolania de Montserrat i Cor Cambra Palau de la Música Catalana will also be part of the album.\n\nThe album is broken up into four movements, and the physical versions of the LP will include 18 songs while digital versions will include 15. Among the physical exclusives are “Focu ‘Ranni” and “Jeanne” from MOV III, and “Novia Robot” from MOV IV. The album also includes songs titled “Porcelana,” “Mio Cristo,””Memória,” and “La Perla.”",

This week, we have the chart of /u/pm174!\n\nRank|Song|Their Points|Actual Rank|Total Points\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n1|Charli xcx - Girl, so confusing featuring lorde|15.0|#154|143.5\n2|Caroline Polachek - Pang|14.0|#387|58.5\n3|Caroline Polachek - So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings|12.5|#400|56.0\n3|The Japanese House - Touching Yourself|12.5|#571|40.5\n5|Taylor Swift - Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)|10.5|#1458|18.5\n5|Troye Sivan - One Of Your Girls|10.5|#770|31.0\n7|Caroline Polachek - Welcome To My Island|7.0|#559|41.0\n7|Sabrina Carpenter - Tears|7.0|#30|523.5\n7|Taylor Swift - So Long, London|7.0|#1011|25.0\n7|The 1975 - Robbers|7.0|#622|37.0\n7|The Japanese House - Something Has To Change|7.0|#2379|14.5\n\nIf you’d like to have your top 10 shown in a future installment, *PLEASE USE [THIS GOOGLE FORM](https://forms.gle/Mpz5yQXzLyMHJsLJ8)*! Also, if you sign up for this **PLEASE also sign up for the actual charts, with the form found below**. \n\n---\n\n[Here's the current list of people signed up for the charts!](https://pastebin.com/utvJZ08B)  \n\n#If you'd like to sign up for the charts, **[you can sign up here](https://forms.gle/es672tr8jzNwp4Qh6)**!\n \nThe tracking dates for the next weekly chart is **October 16, 12:00 PM GMT - October 23, 11:59 AM GMT** and results will come out next Monday, October 27.\n\n---\n\n##How The Chart Works:\n\nThese charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1o624hp/the_popheads_charts_october_13th_2025_will/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

    "content": "Partially inspired by the rise of Showgirls material I've seen with conjunction of the new Taylor record, it had me thinking what is the best \"so bad it's good\" music/albums of pop music. Something that swung hard only to completely hit another mark. Taylor's Life of a Showgirl feels to predictable to fall into this, but her album Rep has the argument on being in that musical equivalent of camp classic, especially with the whole \"goth punk female range bs\". Are their pop equivalents to these campy bad movies, or does that bad its good mentality not translate over to albums",

    "title": "How much do famous artists ACTUALLY make? Can we get real numbers?",
    "content": "I’m so confused about how much famous artists actually make and I’m hoping someone can break down the real numbers. On one hand, you scroll through Instagram and these musicians are flashing massive watch collections, luxury cars, designer everything, the lifestyle screams money. But then I hear people saying that most artists are actually broke, that they’re just fronting for image, or that the labels take everything and they’re barely scraping by despite millions of streams. So what’s the truth? How much does someone with 10 million monthly Spotify listeners actually take home? Is touring where the real money is? Are these luxury lifestyles even real or is it all rented and borrowed? I keep hearing everything from “streaming pays pennies” to “top artists make $50M+ a year” but nobody ever backs it up with actual data. Does anyone actually have insight into what moderately famous musicians (not Taylor Swift level, but like recognized artists) are really earning?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

    "content": "Now that it's been a year since most of the major albums of 2024, which are you still listening to?\n\nI tend to move very swiftly forwards through music, looping a new song every few days and keeping up with weekly album releases, so I haven't had a lot of albums from last year on what one might call \"regular rotation.\" With that said, I have re-listened to some in full, and a few songs made it onto various playlists and came up on autoplay enough for me to sift through my listening metrics out of curiosity.\n\nMy personal most-played 2024 releases in 2025 (not including, e.g., singles for 2025 albums or 2024 albums I heard *for the first time* in 2025):\n\n* ***BRAT*** simply has a lot to offer, so I keep switching my favorite tracks off the record and looping new ones. I didn't understand the \"Everything is romantic\" hype until this year, but now I adore both versions!\n* ***C,XOXO*** has been my surprise recommendation to a *lot* of people; I keep telling people to listen to it using my tracklist order and then just sitting down and doing the same myself. I prefer to listen to the whole thing together as one journey, so it doesn't happen too often, but I have made a lot of time for this album just for how it makes me feel.\n* ***Radical Optimism*** was simply confusing to me on first listen given the promotion and description, but now that I've returned to it, I find it really pleasant and a lovely summer listen! Shout out to everyone who was saying this on release day in the thread; I needed some time to come to the same conclusion.\n* ***Big Ideas*** is similarly summerful; I started itching to play a couple of songs in April and finally got the chance to put it on all the way through around a fire pit over drinks in July. This might become a yearly tradition; it's just so satisfying.\n* ***The Great Impersonator*** has a lot of songs that work for this nostalgic 2000s acoustic phase I've been in this year; it's very pleasant to listen to when I need to slow down and stop dancing. Alternatively, sometimes you just need to cry very hard.\n\n**What are you still listening to?** And if you're listening to too many 2024 albums to count, or just have a different listening style than me (which is most people!), **what has revealed new depths to you over the past year? What do you think will continue to age well and be meaningful to you?**",

Addison Rae, Miley Cyrus, Lorde, Sabrina, neither of them really dominated the conversation although they each had their moments. I’d say that this year was mostly centered around Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift but I’d love to read your opinions !",

The reason being is that I’m no longer in that space I was when the album came out because when was released I just got out of the toxic decade of friendship and I can relate to most of the songs like such as I wish I hated you bye and don’t wanna break up again,but now I can’t really play those songs cause I’m no longer in that headspace. I will say I can play the songs, but it doesn’t hit the same if that makes sense. What about you? \n\nAre there any albums that you can’t really play because you’re no longer sad or happy or whatever reason?",

    "content": "Love and romance is obviously a common subject in pop (perhaps...the most common? A discussion point in itself) but what do we thing is the most referenced stage in relationships? \n\nThe breakup song is obviously a phenomenon in itself -  countless artists have written about the immediate aftermath. Usually this takes the form of wanting someone back, asking what went wrong, or a sassy kiss-off that their ex was never what they wanted anyway. (Consider Hello by Adele, All Too Well by Taylor, or Manchild by Sabrina). \n\nThere's also your classic falling-in-love or I'm-so-lucky song - Ordinary by Alex Warren, Audrey Hepburn by Maisie Peters, countless Ed Sheeran wedding songs. Or the \"what are we??\" song, like Casual by Chappell Roan, or Call Me Maybe by CRJ. Or the \"apologies for what happened\" song, like Back to December by Taylor or Sorry by Justin Bieber. \n\nPersonally I love a \"the relationship is over but we haven't called it quits yet\" song - think Hard Feelings by Lorde or You're Losing Me by Taylor. \n\nSo - what's your favourite part of a relationship to be explored? What are your favourite niche situations to be captured in 3.5 minutes of catchy melodies?",

Tbh i can only think of Ariana at this point.\n\nWhy there are no singers like Whitney, Celine, Beyonce etc. anymore??\n\nEDIT: If you think Sabrina is a vocalist, then you don’t understand my question…\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for all the reactions! Its interesting to see your opions. Also the fact that i think some singers are no power house vocalists (Sabrina, Dua) doesnt mean i dont like them! For me a vocalist is belting, high (and low) notes, runs and riffs, control, vibrato and agility.",

He has demonstrated the rare ability to adapt with the times (his first #1 was \"...Baby One More Time\" by Britney, which was recorded in 1998), but the question is, with which artist(s) can he collaborate to help him achieve this, and how long will it take him?",

This week, we have the chart of /u/tylerf98!\n\nRank|Song|Their Points|Actual Rank|Total Points\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n1|RAYE - WHERE IS MY HUSBAND!|14.5|#16|966.0\n1|Sammy Virji - Survive|14.5|#2139|14.5\n3|Max Dean - Gets Like That|12.5|#3302|12.5\n3|Sammy Virji - Burn The River|12.5|#3302|12.5\n5|Anyma - Girls MIA|7.5|#3515|12.0\n5|Chris Lake - LA NOCHE|7.5|#516|36.5\n5|Doja Cat - Cards|7.5|#39|387.5\n5|Doja Cat - Gorgeous|7.5|#19|787.5\n5|Madison Beer - yes baby|7.5|#46|348.0\n5|Magdalena Bay - Second Sleep|7.5|#33|441.0\n5|Rochelle Jordan - Doing It Too|7.5|#41|382.5\n5|Zara Larsson - Blue Moon|7.5|#22|645.0\n\n\nIf you’d like to have your top 10 shown in a future installment, *PLEASE USE [THIS GOOGLE FORM](https://forms.gle/Mpz5yQXzLyMHJsLJ8)*! Also, if you sign up for this **PLEASE also sign up for the actual charts, with the form found below**. \n\n---\n\n[Here's the current list of people signed up for the charts!](https://pastebin.com/utvJZ08B)  \n\n#If you'd like to sign up for the charts, **[you can sign up here](https://forms.gle/es672tr8jzNwp4Qh6)**!\n \nThe tracking dates for the next weekly chart is **October 9, 12:00 PM GMT - October 16, 11:59 AM GMT** and results will come out next Monday, October 20.\n\n---\n\n##How The Chart Works:\n\nThese charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1o01rls/the_popheads_charts_october_6th_2025_zara_and/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

It was only for 18+ initially, but Avril made it open to all by request and she played a free concert.\n\nWorst was Gene Simmons.Not Pop I know, but KISS is a popular band so I guess it counts.He's a creep and makes everybody feel uncomfortable, especially women. Won't go into details but yeah, he's notorious for this.",

    "content": "So I've listened to every Kylie Minogue album but yesterday when I was trying to listen to her song \"The One\" I accidentally stumbled across a song called [\"I Am The One For You,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYtEdrDWB7E) a house banger from the early '90s that I had no clue existed! It was apparently a B-side for the single release of [\"Shocked\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwYB-DVS27k) and it just made me think about how cool it is that I've been a dedicated fan of Kylie for years now and have actively tried to listen to as much of her music as I can, and yet I'm still finding new little songs hidden away. Her discography is so deep and she's been around for so many different release formats that there's always some B-side or remix or compilation single or something waiting out there to be discovered.\n\nThis is an experience I have specifically with Kylie, and it got me thinking... what are other unique factors that you find \"rewarding\" about being a fan of a specific artist? Obviously we're fans of artists because we like their music, but is there anything else about them that gives them that special little edge and gives you a unique experience with them, specifically?\n\nFor example, one of the benefits of being a Mariah Carey fan is that she cares a lot about honoring her past music, so she's great about releasing tasteful anniversary versions of her albums that are remastered and include new remixes and unreleased songs. Another benefit is that she takes remixes very seriously, so she has lots of remix albums/EPs that are worth listening to.\n\nWould love to hear other things people like about being fans of their faves!",

    "content": "I've been thinking about this recently after Charli XCX finally wrested control from her label to create *BRAT* (2024) only after doing *Crash* (2022) essentially entirely to her label's specifications and having it underperform compared to their expectations. **EDIT: So I completely misremembered this story. To everyone wondering why I was very wrong about this, that is why. I'm sorry! Thanks to those who corrected me in the comments; you should read their comments.**\n\nKim Petras is now having a similar experience on a similar timeline—after years of scrapped albums (\\~2019-2022), she did exactly what her label asked with *Feed the Beast* (2023)*,* which underperformed, which seems to have allowed her to make some kind of bargain where they give her no money and she does the kind of (harsher, weirder) music she wants currently (without a single credit from Dr. Luke!) While it's not getting the critical or commercial success of *BRAT,* it seems artistically more true to what she wants to be doing, and the fans are happy again.\n\nToday I realized Britney Spears had a similar arc—after years of the conservatorship, with the bombing of *Britney Jean* (2013), she was finally able to convince the team to let her have somewhat more control over *Glory* (2016), which she remains incredibly proud of. Despite the album not doing as well commercially as some of her others, again, it was obviously more in line with what she wanted, and the superfans were (and are!) very happy with it.\n\n**Who are some other artists who had to let a project underperform in order to get enough control to do what they wanted?**",

For additional context, please read [this introductory post](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1nt8tzn/ratricks_revenge_an_introduction/) from the start of the event. There's also a full fanfiction that accompanies the rate that expounds upon the lore of St. Ratrick, which I will link after I finish uploading it to AO3.\n\nIf you're completely lost and do not know what a rate is, check this [30 second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UifAv-gVqI0) or [6 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1SDlLZcpM) tutorial video.\n\nOne thing to note is that this is our third ever flash rate! A flash rate is just like a normal rate, except it is only open for a very limited time and reveals all in one day. As such, **this rate will be due in less than 72 hours.** It will then reveal within hours of the scores being due.\n\nWithout further ado, this flash rate is OPEN!\n\n---\n\n# Songlist\n\nThe winners of each of the games, plus the creative contributors to the rate, each got to submit one song that fit the following moodboard:\n\n* revenge\n* darkness\n* sadness\n* negativity\n* \"gone bad\" (Rihanna/Reputation style)\n\nHere is what they came up with:\n\n1. 070 Shake - Elephant\n2. 5 Seconds of Summer - Voodoo Doll\n3. Adele - Set Fire to the Rain\n4. Akini Jing - Villain (feat. Tee Zandos)\n5. Bebe Rexha - Sacrifice\n6. Beyoncé - Don't Hurt Yourself (feat. Jack White)\n7. Charli xcx - Sympathy is a knife\n8. Dolly Parton - Baby I'm Burnin'\n9. Dreamcatcher - Chase Me\n10. Femtanyl - Murder Every 1 U Know! (feat. Takihasdied)\n11. Imogen Heap - Hide and Seek\n12. Metric - Die Happy\n13.

Taylor Swift - All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\n25. The Chicks - Goodbye Earl\n\n---\n\n# Copypasted Rules\n\n* Listen to every song and score each 1 to 10. You can use decimals to one point, meaning 7.5 is acceptable, but 7.75 is not.\n\n* Score every song without skipping any. I won't be able to record your ballot if it's not completely filled out. If you accidentally miss any songs, I'll send a DM asking you to correct it, but given the short timetable of this rate, this is riskier than usual as you will have less time to correct your mistake.\n\n* Use the formatted ballot to submit your scores. Rates use a program that requires properly formatted ballots, so it's easiest for everyone if you use it!

    "content": "Welcome back to the Popheads Jukebox! Here are [the results from last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1nqie55/the_popheads_jukebox_revival_week_326_i_get_wet/?):\n\n* Sabrina Carpenter - Tears: 8.75\n* JADE - Unconditional: 7.64\n* CMAT - When A Good Man Cries: 7.33\n* Lady Gaga - The Dead Dance: 7.20\n\n\\-\n\n* Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine - Conga: 9.07\n\n\n###Rules Refresher\n\n1. Rate the songs a score from 1 to 10. Please keep it to one decimal place at the most (so 7.5 is fine but 7.58 is not). Also don’t get too hung up on the final scores. This is a fun exercise and not a competition so don’t worry about over/under rating things. Just give what you think the song is to you.\n\n2. For your review, reply to the comment that will be posted by one of us for each song. Avoid posting your reviews as a top level comment cause we probably won’t notice them if you do. Non-reviews such as questions or general commentary as upper level comments are fine.\n\n3. Must have some sort of justification. Try to be a bit more concise than “It’s a bop!” or “I don’t like it”. Explain why! It doesn’t have to be long, two or three sentences can be plenty (though more is definitely allowed). We reserve the right not to include a review in the final total if proper justification is not given.\n\n4. You don’t have to review each song to participate! You can do all of them or only the ones you’re familiar with.\n\n5. The thread will be open for 13 days and close in two Wednesdays around 11PM EST. The scores will be calculated and a new post will come up the next day (Thursday) at 5PM EST(ish) with the next week’s tracks.\n\n---\n\n###This Week’s Tracks\n\n* **[Allie X - Is Anybody Out There?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RUjfajOqmc)**\n* **[Madison Beer - yes baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFmNWm60bjA)**\n* **[Miley Cyrus - Secrets (feat.

Like, any level of \"star\".\n\nI understand it's completely dependent on the level of success, the time period (like someone selling loads of physical copies in 1999 would have made a lot more money than someone today relying on streams), the specific record deal, the amount of touring and merchandising etc. and even then I imagine it must be so difficult to measure exactly because there's so many income streams and it's very volatile...but there's also (understandably) a lot of hush hush surrounding it. I'd still be curious if someone has ever given concrete actual numbers. Most of the figures I see are just the net worth estimations from Forbes and the likes which are obviously just a general guesstimate.",

In normal weeks, songs are sometimes several months or over a year old. It's become very stale. There's also double counting between B200/BH100.",
    "content": "Here's my proposed fix.\n\n**BILLBOARD 200** (ALBUMS)\n\n* Only 4 variants are allowed for the life of an album\n   * Example: *Sandbox* (Standard Edition), *Sandbox* (Deluxe Edition), *Sandbox* (Deluxe Edition - Clean), *Sandbox* (Anniversary Edition)\n   * The reason being that it forces labels to be strategic on how they utilize their variant strategy. Do they want to release the same album in different colors? Or do they want to reserve it for later to offer outtakes/extra tracks?\n* Clean / Edit Versions of an album count as a variant\n   * Some artists are forcing swearing on songs just so they can issue a separate SKU for the clean version. This closes that loophole. This rule also forces artists to think, \"Do I really need to swear here? Do I want to use 1 variant slot to release a clean version? Or do I release all variants in explicit and just issue clean versions for singles?\"\n* Each variant is allowed to be released in 4 different physical formats + 1 digital\n   * Example: *Sandbox* (Standard Edition) can be released in CD, CD+DVD, Cassette, Vinyl and Digital. Same as the other editions. The artist doesn't have to do all. They just have the option.\n* Only two variants at launch; sales from excess variants will not be counted\n* Six months from the original release, the artist can utilize their remaining two variants if they choose\n* Sales from variants in excess of 4 are not counted towards the charts\n   * Eligible variants are taken from order of release/announcement. If that data isn't available, they will be sorted alphabetically based on variant name. If there is no variant name, the sorting will be on catalog number.\n\n**BILLBOARD HOT 100** (SINGLES)\n\n* Artists are required to issue a \"single page\" for their singles during their respective campaign period\n   * Example: \"The Life of a Snowgirl - Single\"\n* Once the promo campaign for their chosen single is done, the artists can remove the \"single page\"\n* Only three singles from the same album can be active at a time; if they want to issue a new single, they must remove one of the active \"single pages\"\n* Clean versions are not counted towards their 3-singles-at-a-time quota\n* **Streaming:**\n   * ONLY *active singles* will be counted towards the Hot 100\n   * *Active singles* will ONLY be counted towards the Hot 100, not the Billboard 200\n   * Non-singles and *inactive singles* are counted towards Billboard 200\n* **Digital store purchases:** Song purchases remain as is. They are counted towards the Hot 100 regardless of if they are a single or not.\n\n**GENERAL CHANGES**\n\n* Consumers can only purchase a maximum of 2 copies per order per week (albums / physical singles), or 1 copy per order per week per account (digital).\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Was thinking about how there’s been conversation around Taylor with TLOAS and the album being a lot of cutesy love songs, which people think don’t live up to her other songs lyrically. \n\nSo I wanna know, what artists do you all think make the best love songs about romance? Like I love you so much, you’re the love of my life type or songs? And what songs from them would you recommend?",

    "content": "Recently, Ghostface Killah cancelled his tour and claimed it was because of the government shutdown, which makes no sense. A lot of people compared it to Joey Badass dropping out of Logic's tour and saying he got eye damage from looking at the solar eclipse (he later admitted that wasn't true, he just didn't want to do the tour anymore).\n\nThis got me wondering about the dumbest and most obvious lies told by popstars.

    "content": "With the rise of multiple album variants from every artist or band, why don’t music services let you pick which one you like as a feature? \n\n\nBack in the day, artist had one main photo for their cover with a possible deluxe version which sometimes would be the same cover with deluxe added on. But nowadays with all different variants being released, wouldn’t it make sense for Spotify to have a feature where it lets you pick which one? I know you can make playlists with different covers, or download the files and make a certain cover what you’d like. \n\nWould this be something you would want to see? The variants and multiple covers have been popular mostly since 2020, and I think for a more personal experience as consumers we should be able to choose what cover we like the most. I really don’t think artists can say “well I want the main cover to represent the album” when they release so many different covers to choose and purchase from, when most of us don’t listen to physical music and mostly buy them to support the artist when we are mostly streaming in this day and age. That’s why I personally like purchasing physical music for how personable it feels and I think music services need something that isn’t a cash grab to make streaming feel more personal. Even as a pro feature. \n\n\nThere are Spotify variants of albums that artists do for their cd or vinyl pressings but I think such a simple feature would feel nice if an artist chooses to do so. For example with the recent release of show girl, Taylor has over 20 covers to choose from with deluxe, online only etc. I know these are cash grabs to get more sales but I would personally enjoy the it’s beautiful variant on streaming, or the red lipstick vinyl pressing.",

    "content": "Earlier today, I decided to listen and compare Taylor Swift's recently released album, The Life Of A Showgirl in both versions.\n\nI think in my opinion, the clean version is better because she goes overboard when it comes to using explicit words and when she doesn't use it, she sounds more creative and deeper for me. I also think it's because she's showing it, not telling it.\n\nFor example:\nOn the chorus of the song \"Wood\", she said:\n\nAll of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star\nNever did me any good\nI ain't got to knock on wood\nIt's you and me forever dancing in the dark\nAll over me, it's understood\nI ain't got to knock on wood\nForgive me, it sounds cocky\nHe **dickmatized** me\nAnd opened my eyes\nRedwood tree\nIt ain't hard to see\nHis love was the key\nThat opened my thighs\n\nBut then, on the cleaner verson, she said:\n\n(Ah) All of that missin', wishing on a falling star\nNever did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood\n(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark\nAll over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood\nForgive me, it sounds cocky\nHe **hypnotised** me and opened my eyes\nRedwood tree, it ain't hard to see\nHis love was the key that opened my skies\n\nThe cleaner version sounds better because she's showing everyone what she's feeling over the love that Travis is giving her, while still being subtle about it and the cleaner version also ties back to the earlier song on the tracklist, Opalite, where she sang:\n\n\nBut my Mama told me, \"It's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nSleepless in the onyx night\nBut now the sky is opalite\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh my Lord\nNever made no one like you before\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now the sky is opalite\"\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh\n\n-------------------------\nAlso, in the song Father Figure, she sang at the explicit version:\n\nI'll be your father figure\nI drink that brown liquor\nI can make deals with the devil because my **dick's** bigger\nThis love is pure profit\nJust step into my office\nI dry your tears with my sleeve\n\nWhile in the clean version, she sang:\n\nI'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor\nI can make deals with the devil because my **check’s** bigger\nThis love is pure profit, just step into my office\nI dry your tears with my sleeve\n\nI think the cleaner version is better because she's singing in the perspective of a powerful person instead of a dick-measuring contest.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Also, if you sign up for this **PLEASE also sign up for the actual charts, with the form found below**. \n\n---\n\n[Here's the current list of people signed up for the charts!](https://pastebin.com/utvJZ08B)  \n\n#If you'd like to sign up for the charts, **[you can sign up here](https://forms.gle/es672tr8jzNwp4Qh6)**!\n \nThe tracking dates for the next weekly chart is **October 2, 12:00 PM GMT - October 9, 11:59 AM GMT** and results will come out next Monday, October 13.\n\n---\n\n##How The Chart Works:\n\nThese charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1ntzpeq/the_popheads_charts_september_29th_2025_where_is/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

    "content": "My theory is that iconic artists always have 2 distinct genres/styles, and the way they “blend” them makes them iconic. One is more for radio (the genre that gets the big budget music videos), and one is for storytelling/songwriting (getting to know the artist). \n\nThe Weeknd: 80s synth / dark r&amp;b\n\nLady Gaga: electro pop / soft rock ballads\n\nDrake: dance-hall pop / classic rap\n\nTaylor: max martin synth pop / folk country pop\n\nBillie: avant garde dark music / soft pop\n\nBruno Mars: funky disco / sappy ballads\n\nThe list could go on. But I’ve noticed that more unique the mix, the faster the artist becomes “big”. Often times these artists aren’t reinventing the wheel, but rather the unique combination of these 2 genres makes them “them”. \n\nAlso you’ll notice that sometimes, when an artist has their breakthrough moment, it’s often due to finding that “second genre” that makes them really unique. (Sabrina and Post Malone with country, for example)\n\nAnd often artsts who only have 1 main genre that they are known for are not taken as seriously as artists, or are seen as one dimensional. (Think Tyla or Halsey or Camila Cabello - they have hit potential and name recognition but need that “second genre” to add dimension to their artistry.)",

    "title": "20 Years of Fiona Apple's Extraordinary Machine",
    "content": "[On October 4, 2005 Fiona Apple released Extraordinary Machine](https://preview.redd.it/ebx6mhby58tf1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f64c5a7ecd1bb06011bd68e6cccc59578ae54df)\n\n**Prelude:**\n\nFiona Apple shot into the spotlight in 90s with her sharp lyrics, her sharp speeches and her great music. As was common back then, she wasn't taken seriously by critics back then as a woman who wrote her own music and her involvement as often questioned [and much of her genius was credited to Jon Brion](https://americansongwriter.com/jon-brion-on-producing-fiona-apple/). Fiona recorded Extraordinary Machine with Jon Brion, and the Jon Brion version leaked fully in the middle of label drama while Fiona was rerecording the album with Mike Elizondo and Brian Kehew. The Jon Brion version was dramatic and full of strings and much loved by fans and some critics, but Fiona was not happy with how it turned out and didn't consider it finished. She rerecorded the album to be more in line with her later works with experimental percussion and focus on her own piano skills.\n\n  \n**Album:**\n\nExtraordinary Machine is an extraordinary album. The official version of the album has 12 tracks, all written by Fiona and all but two produced by Mike Elizondo and Brian Kehew. Extraordinary Machine and Waltz (Better than Fine) were produced by Jon Brion, and feature lush, sweeping strings and grand orchestral arrangements. \n\nGet Him Back is a masterpiece about revenge on her ex she gracefully refused to name. The song is driven by heavy percussion and piano. She flips the script during the last chorus and makes it a song about getting back with her ex. This song would inspire several generations of pop girls to make their own versions of this song, including Alecia Cara, Taylor Swift, and Olivia Rodrigo- the last two would even reference the song in the song title.\n\n  \nThe focus on experimental production continues onto Tymps, which also features fuzzy synths, mellotron and programmed drums along with tacked pianos.\n\nParting Gift is was a new song as a stripped back song with almost no instruments other than Fiona's voice and a piano while she was rerecording the album. This is the most \"Fiona Apple\" song of the album. The drama in the song isn't a result of the production choices or arrangements but a result of Fiona emoting through her voice and playing with the dynamics of the instruments she controls.  \n\n\nWindow, Oh Well, Please Please Please, and Red Red Red continue the focus on percussion and Fiona's voice with support from guitars and piano as well as the occasional organs and bass.  \n\n\nThe climax of the album is Not About Love, the best song on the album in my opinion. And this song is also the climax of Fiona's clash of vision with the production of Jon Brion, the official release of this song is the most different from Jon Brion's version. The officially released version of the song is angry, with heavy piano and drums and expresses the emotions of the song through songwriting and vocals alone. The Jon Brion version of the song features a very prominent strings playing along with piano which overshadow's Fionas piano as well as her voice and creates a melodramatic soundscape where Fiona plays second fiddle to a very prominent cello. Mike's drums on the other hand compliment Fiona's piano and vocals very nicely and she gets to shine in her own song.  \n\n\nJon Brion finally returns to the album in the closer, Waltz which starts quite minimalistic compared to the bootlegged album songs, over the course of the song it features a nice piano melody, faint organ and drum and very prominent strings orchestrated by Patrick Warren.\n\n  \n**The Response:**\n\n  \nThe album was a critical smash, and the official version topped the best albums of the years list published by New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, and Slant. It also ranked high in the year end list published by Blender magazine, Rolling Stone, Los Angeles Times, Spin, and The Village Voice.\n\n  \nPitchfork, in their contrarianness and \\[dissmissal of Fiona's artistic integrity\\](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/247-when-the-pawn/) ranked the leaked version of the album on their year end list, and called the official version a \"rehash\". \n\n  \nCommercially the album as hurt by the bootlegged version leaking but it still did fine and sold 1 million copies and was certified gold by RIAA.\n\n  \n**The Legacy and Future:**\n\n  \nExtraordinary Machine is the sound of Fiona Apple refusing to be contained by her fans' or producer's expectations and releasing what she wanted to release. Twenty years later, Extraordinary Machine is still a pivotal album for 2000s music. It has inspired generations of songwriters, and the soundscape explored by Fiona Apple would be fleshed out in The Idler Wheel and Fetch The Bolt Cutters. Keys and drums would become more and more prominent in records, with The Idler Wheel being produced primarily by the pianist Feedy and drummer Seedy. Fiona would take greater role in production of her later records and her vision would bring her widespread critical acclaim, especially when she would distill her sound to perfection with Fetch the Bolt Cutters which is the second highest rated album of all time on Metacritic.",

    "title": "Music Nerd Approved K-Pop Rate (f(x) vs Wonder Girls vs LOONA / ODD EYE CIRCLE vs Red Velvet vs YUKIKA)",
    "content": "Onion haseyo yeorobum\n\nIt’s a pleasure for u/rickikardashian and I to present to you…\n\n## The Music Nerd Approved K-Pop Rate!\n\nA rate consisting of 5 of the most acclaimed K-Pop projects in online circles.\n\n---\n\n# f(x) - Pink Tape\n\nThe first project in this lineup is from perhaps one of the first K-pop artists to garner critical clout in the Anglosphere. While SM Entertainment's Girls' Generation indulged in every sort of style across mainstream music with a bubblegum twist, f(x) were the edgier, experimental counterpart who traversed the extremes of electronic dance-pop. Pink Tape was their sophomore album, and remains a touchstone not just for the recognition of K-pop in English publications but also for the potential that remains in Korean pop.\n\nPerhaps what has allowed Pink Tape to remain so relevant is its representation of the unique quirks one can only find in K-pop. Take, for example, \"Shadow\", which marries a stalker narrative to a bouncy electronic beat for an eerie take on electropop that has few other parallels. The interpolation of \"Little Drummer Boy\" on \"Rum Pum Pum Pum\" alongside a cultural potpourri of other influences allows for f(x) to develop one of the most novel title tracks in K-pop history. Elsewhere on the album their muse guides them towards Sleigh Bells-esque chanting, ethereal electro house, and cutesy doo-wop pastiche. While f(x) are no longer active, their influence remains undeniable among every generation of K-pop that follows them.\n\n# Wonder Girls - REBOOT\n\nAs somebody growing up in an Asian American community, I was passingly familiar with K-pop exports; I remember having an elementary school friend tell me to listen to SHINee, and adoring the clamorousness of Girls' Generation's \"The Boys.\" Yet the one K-pop group that has remained in my consciousness the longest was the ever-retro, internationally beloved Wonder Girls. To younger me, \"Nobody\" was the barometer to which every Korean crossover would be compared; it was the first single from a Korean pop act to enter the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nWonder Girls debuted in 2007 as the flagship girl group of JYP with five members: Sunye, Hyuna, Sunmi, Sohee, and Yeeun. Shortly before their debut album, Hyuna would drop out due to health issues (she would later join the girl group 4Minute and debut solo with \"Bubble Pop!\", a song which would be parodied on Family Guy, if that's your bag), and she was replaced with Yubin prior to their debut album. Their singles \"Tell Me\" and the aforementioned \"Nobody\" would launch viral dance crazes, and polls from Gallup Korea would rank them as the Singer of the Year in 2007 and 2008. 2009, the year which Google suggests begins the steady climb of searches for K-pop, marks the beginning of Wonder Girls' stint as an opening act for the Jonas Brothers. In 2010, Sunmi would leave the group to be replaced by Hyerim. Their TeenNick debut would arrive two years later. Five years later, following a three year hiatus, Sunmi would return as Sunye and Sohee departed.\n\nThus begins the journey towards Wonder Girls' third and final album, the aptly titled Reboot. Promotional materials would embrace their new concept as a bona fide band; although they did not play the instruments on the studio recording, every member would have production and writing credits throughout Reboot, and the group would perform their instruments live. The album was a revelation, both a revision of what Wonder Girls were and a true reboot of the sounds of the 1980s. Single \"I Feel You\" would be a proper tribute to the excitement of freestyle music, while \"Rewind\" brought back the swingbeat slow jams of the early '90s. \"Back\" paid homage to old school hip hop, while \"One Black Night\" had all the excitement of '80s anthems like Michael Sembello's \"Maniac.\" Reboot is a hallmark of K-pop not just for its excellent production value, not just for its effortless pastiches of bygone eras, but also for its representation of exactly what great music can come about as a result of creative input from K-pop idols themselves.\n\n\n# LOONA/ODD EYE CIRCLE - Max &amp; Match\n\nstan loona\n\n\n\n\n# Red Velvet - The Perfect Red Velvet\n\nAt the end of 2019, Billboard released a list of the greatest K-pop songs of the decade to slight mutterings of approval. #1 was IU's \"Good Day,\" which, I fear, has nothing to do with this rate, but just beneath it was a marvelous tune by none other than the girl group Red Velvet. The writer of the blurb off-handedly describes Red Velvet as \"the best idol group alive,\" the torch having been passed down from f(x) presumably in some elaborate SM Entertainment ritual. While the statement remains a bit of insane hyperbole, their catalog is the perfect rebuttal to any skepticism that they haven't earned their place in the K-pop pantheon.\n\nWith their debut album The Red embracing the exuberant, energetic \"Red\" side of their concept, Red Velvet's sophomore record Perfect Velvet exists as the sultry, sensual counterpart representing their \"Velvet\" side. Coming off of the success of their joyous \"Red Flavor\" summer single, expectations were higher than ever for a new full-length album, especially as previous singles had indulged further and further in the mania of bombastic pop. As further visual teasers for the album dropped, the contrast was evident: in lieu of campy fruit interviews, they were embracing campy horror poster graphics complete with blood spatters. While the group had always had an element of unease in their music, with the video for title track \"Peek-a-Boo\" they expanded upon the slapstick murder concept of \"Russian Roulette\" into a creepier, almost \"elevated horror\"-esque tale of homicide. The songs on the album ranged from more overtly funky synth pastiche to quirkier bass music inspired pop, all given a degree of polish beyond their contemporaries. The album would later be re-released as a repackage later that year as The Perfect Red Velvet, with one of their most iconic singles \"Bad Boy\" as the title track. The album proper would be recognized as one of the greatest K-pop projects of the decade by Billboard; as we near a decade since their debut full-length, does their arguable magnum opus hold up?\n\n\n# YUKIKA - SOUL LADY\n\nstan yukika\n\n\n---\n\n##How to Complete a Rate\n\n- Use the prepared format found [HERE](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2FYukikaChartUpdates&amp;subject=Music%20Nerd%20Approved%20K-Pop%20Rate%20Ballot&amp;message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Pink%20Tape%0A%0ARum%20Pum%20Pum%20Pum%3A%20%0A%0AShadow%3A%20%0A%0APretty%20Girl%3A%20%0A%0AKick%3A%20%0A%0ASignal%3A%20%0A%0AStep%3A%20%0A%0AGoodbye%20Summer%3A%20%0A%0AAirplane%3A%20%0A%0AToy%3A%20%0A%0ANo%20More%3A%20%0A%0ASnapshot%3A%20%0A%0AEnding%20Page%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20REBOOT%0A%0ABaby%20Don't%20Play%3A%20%0A%0ACandle%3A%20%0A%0AI%20Feel%20You%3A%20%0A%0ARewind%3A%20%0A%0ALoved%3A%20%0A%0AJohn%20Doe%3A%20%0A%0AOne%20Black%20Night%3A%20%0A%0ABack%3A%20%0A%0AOPPA%3A%20%0A%0AFaded%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AGONE%3A%20%0A%0ARemember%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Max%20%26%20Match%0A%0AADD%3A%20%0A%0ASweet%20Crazy%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AUncover%3A%20%0A%0AGirl%20Front%3A%20%0A%0ALOONATIC%3A%20%0A%0AChaotic%3A%20%0A%0AStarlight%3A%20%0A%0AODD%20Front%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20The%20Perfect%20Red%20Velvet%0A%0ABad%20Boy%3A%20%0A%0AAll%20Right%3A%20%0A%0APeek-A-Boo%3A%20%0A%0ALook%3A%20%0A%0AI%20Just%3A%20%0A%0AKingdom%20Come%3A%20%0A%0ATime%20to%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AMy%20Second%20Date%3A%20%0A%0AAttaboy%3A%20%0A%0APerfect%2010%3A%20%0A%0AAbout%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AMoonlight%20Melody%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20%20SOUL%20LADY%0A%0AFrom%20HND%20to%20GMP%3A%20%0A%0AI%20FEEL%20LOVE%3A%20%0A%0ASOUL%20LADY%3A%20%0A%0ANEON%3A%20%0A%0AYesterday%3A%20%0A%0AA%20Day%20For%20Love%3A%20%0A%0Apit-a-pet%3A%20%0A%0ACherries%20Jubiles%3A%20%0A%0AI%20Need%20A%20Friend%3A%20%0A%0ASHADE%3A%20%0A%0AAll%20flights%20are%20delayed%3A%20%0A%0ANEON%201989%3A%20%0A%0AEND) to fill in and send your scores.

I am joined by my beloved cohosts /u/JIRACHI &amp; /u/Stryxen to make this a rate you will never forget. \n\nFeaturing 3 of the biggest stars of the 80s making their transition to the early 90s with bold and sexually charged statements that led to varying degrees of pushback. Madonna being no stranger to controversy courted her biggest backlash so far during this era, Janet, who had spent most of the 80s stepping outside of her family’s shadow to show she was a star in her own right continued her hot streak of hits while embracing further genre experimentation and exploration, and Sade locking in to make a genre-, decade-, and star-defining statement that defied their polished public reputation… and then falling asleep for the rest of the decade.\n\n## Quick links/tldr\n\n[Submission link](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=FlavaSavaVandal&amp;subject=90s%20Sensual%20Songstresses%20Rate&amp;message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Erotica%0A%0AErotica%3A%20%0A%0AFever%3A%20%0A%0ABye%20Bye%20Baby%3A%20%0A%0ADeeper%20and%20Deeper%3A%20%0A%0AWhere%20Life%20Begins%3A%20%0A%0ABad%20Girl%3A%20%0A%0AWaiting%3A%20%0A%0AThief%20of%20Hearts%3A%20%0A%0AWords%3A%20%0A%0ARain%3A%20%0A%0AWhy%20It's%20So%20Hard%3A%20%0A%0AIn%20This%20Life%3A%20%0A%0ADid%20You%20Do%20It%3F%3A%20%0A%0ASecret%20Garden%3A%20%0A%0AJustify%20My%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20janet.%0A%0AThat's%20The%20Way%20Love%20Goes%3A%20%0A%0AYou%20Want%20This%3A%20%0A%0AIf%3A%20%0A%0AThis%20Time%3A%20%0A%0AThrob%3A%20%0A%0AWhat'll%20I%20Do%3A%20%0A%0AFunky%20Big%20Band%3A%20%0A%0ANew%20Agenda%3A%20%0A%0ABecause%20Of%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AAgain%3A%20%0A%0AWhere%20Are%20You%20Now%3A%20%0A%0AThe%20Body%20That%20Loves%20You%3A%20%0A%0AAny%20Time%2C%20Any%20Place%3A%20%0A%0AAre%20You%20Still%20Up%3A%20%0A%0AWhoops%20Now%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Love%20Deluxe%0A%0ANo%20Ordinary%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AFeel%20No%20Pain%3A%20%0A%0AI%20Couldn't%20Love%20You%20More%3A%20%0A%0ALike%20a%20Tattoo%3A%20%0A%0AKiss%20of%20Life%3A%20%0A%0ACherish%20the%20Day%3A%20%0A%0APearls%3A%20%0A%0ABullet%20Proof%20Soul%3A%20%0A%0AMermaid%3A%20%0A%0ABONUS%20TRACKS%0A%0AMorning%3A%20%0A%0AYou%20Know%3A%20%0A%0ABe%20A%20Good%20Boy%3A%20%0A%0ABack%3A%20%0A%0AGo%20On%20Miss%20Janet%3A%20%0A%0AThe%20Lounge%3A%20%0A%0ARacism%3A%20%0A%0ALove%20Part%202%3A%20%0A%0AWind%3A%20%0A%0AAnother%20Lover%3A%20%0A%0AHold%20On%20Baby%3A%20%0A%0ARain%3A%20%0A%0ASweet%20Dreams%3A%20%0A%0AEND)\n\n[Backup ballot template](https://pastebin.com/eQWT0HcH)\n\nDue Date: Tentatively 9th November\n\nReveal Weekend: Tentatively 14-16th November\n\n[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3E2OdxLo1AzuW6LROkdlvw) | [Apple](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/90s-sensual-songstresses-rate/pl.u-b3b81PgU0EK5mo) | [Tidal](https://tidal.com/playlist/b555ed88-e307-498b-867d-2c45ac4493b9) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2v649r5f8TxKYU-6bMs4IXIe8iJLseWa)\n\n# Madonna - *Erotica* (1992)\n\n*“There’s a certain satisfaction, in a little bit of pain”*\n\nMadonna is no stranger to being expressive in her artistry in spite of all public backlash: Pepsi pulling its sponsorship with the superstar over “Like a Prayer”; multiple religious groups protesting against the airing of the same video; MTV banning the video for “Justify My Love”... However, in 1992, almost three years after her last album “Like A Prayer”, Madonna was about to release one of, if not her riskiest ventures in her career ever, one that is so important that it is still referenced and talked about to this day, at least by the gays.\n\nReleased on October 20, “Erotica” is Madonna’s fifth studio album and it marked a huge departure from her past dancefloor diva persona, instead introducing the world to a more melancholic, vulnerable and sensual (shocking, i know) side to the singer. Accompanying its release is “Sex”, Madonna’s first ever book publication consisting of explicit and erotic images of the singer engaging in different sexual activities. Altogether they form a head-to-toe conceptual output, one where Madonna’s innermost thoughts and fantasies were being explored through art.\n\n“Erotica” is as 90’s urban as it can get- one of those albums where you could hear New York City just from the songs alone. The album is an amalgamation of dance pop, r&amp;b and hip hop, with hints of jazz and house influences sprinkled into it, which when all combined creates music to dance to, to fuck to and to think (MESSAGE!) to, or all at once if you’re just strong like that. As the title suggests, “Erotica” is in its core, erotic AF. In the album, Madonna finds comfort in both physical and emotional intimacy, drawing connections between feelings of pleasure &amp; pain. This central idea is furthered explored from lyrical themes as straightforward as sexual innuendos and BDSM in songs like the title track, “Secret Garden” and “Where Life Begins”, to deeper, more thought-provoking nuances such as interpersonal relationships and queerness in songs like “Bad Girl”, “Why Is It So Hard” and “In This Life”. Here lies the beauty within the record: just like in real life, it will never JUST be about the sex. It is about people, about heart, and about pain; You don’t get turned on by pure physical attraction, you’re eroticized by the feelings. From slow soulful jams with vulnerable, almost spoken word like lyrical deliveries, to hard hitting dance tracks that make your heart race and your feets break, “Erotica” is a musical reenactment of sex itself: hot and cold, rough and soft, sweet and sour. \n\nIt is also incredibly worthy to mention that both “Erotica” and “Sex” were released at the peak of the HIV/AIDS crisis, where sexual liberation, especially that linked with queerness, was an extremely sensitive subject that most people would rather avoid talking about, or worse, frown upon. Madonna’s unafraidness to reference such themes in her music not only paved the way for female openness and expression in the future, it had also raised awareness for the LGBTQ+ community and brought necessary discourse within the general public. \n\nCommercially, “Erotica” peaked at #2 on the Billboard Albums Chart, alongside spawning two top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 with the title track and “Deeper &amp; Deeper”. When compared to her previous efforts, although “Erotica” is considered an underperformance for the megastar, which mainly is due to the overwhelming backlash from the “Sex” book, “Erotica” has 100% stood the test of time, with many regarding it as her best work to date. \n\nWritten by JIRACHI\n\n**Songlist:**\n\n1.

Following 3 commercial success ‘80s smooth pop records, Sade hit the ‘90s sprinting with 1992’s *Love Deluxe*, a downtempo, mature and intimate, classy party stand-out in a very consistent discography, and a departure from the aesthetics and concepts of the other albums in this rate. What *Love Deluxe’s* character omits in Scandal and Celebrity, it more than makes up for in Heart and Truth Bombs, and there’s still plenty of nudity and sensuality to earn its spot in this lineup. Sade is THE QUEEN OF WOKENESS with a MESSAGE!... discussing poverty, racism, war, and love, sex, and empowerment, with the elusive Sade Adu quietly but consistently being a woke progressive queer ally; last year, she released a soundtrack song [“Young Lion”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFMmnMjFiPk), a supportive tribute to her transgender son.\n\nWhile Sade’s legacy has aged as luxuriously as their music and ascended to classic status, the band’s soulful and spotless sound, perhaps too ahead of its time, was more regarded as an inoffensive background record for a middle class dinner party than the cool enigmatic sensual icon depicted on the album cover. Thankfully new generations of listeners have rediscovered this album with a rapturous reverence, even making deep cuts into honest hits: “Like a Tattoo” has rightfully become the album’s most streamed track, only behind other Tiktok hit “Smooth Operator” in the band’s full discography. “Like a Tattoo” is the best example of this smooth soul r&amp;b sound but its grave confessive story-telling, alongside similar tracks “Pearls” and “Feel No Pain”, lets Sade’s liquid vocals and polished r&amp;b come alive with a sharp edge that cuts to the emotional core of every song. The trip hop sleeper hit “Kiss of Life (There Must Have Been An Angel By My Side)” and the lead single “No Ordinary Love” with its chugging almost-metal guitars are innovative, reinvent the band’s signature sound with alternative genres, while “Bullet Proof Soul” and “Cherish The Day” bring elegant melodies and pertinent songwriting that make even the Sophisti-est jazz songs dynamic and full.\n\nAll that said, I do think your first *Love Deluxe* listen over a middle class dinner party would be quite divine and it is indeed RECOMMENDED LISTENING for the rate. Acceptable alternatives: bubble bath; moonlight rooftop; jazz lounge; a really fancy elevator.\n\nWritten by Stryxen\n\n**Songlist:**\n\n1.

(the album) is the album where Janet (the person) learned to fuck. Before this in the 80s, Janet Jackson’s output generally shied away from the topic of s.e.x. in favour of new-jack-swing dance bops covering a range of topics personal autonomy, and race + gender relations, and love. One of her earliest big hits, *Let’s Wait Awhile* was ostensibly about not having s.e.x. in favour of being abstinent, at least for a while, in a way that feels weirdly prescient of what was to come for Janet’s 90’s output\n\nSo fast forward to 1993, it has been a few years since the absolutely massive Rhythm Nation 1814 era had run its course. And she was among the biggest names in music while still only being 2* albums into her music career. In between that album and janet. Janet’s contract with A&amp;M had run its course and a huge bidding war started for her name, eventually Virgin (yes really) won the bid and Janet and her two primary collaborators, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis would begin work on janet. \n\njanet. is an intimate album. Dropping her last name in the title of the album to show that this album is about her, completely removed from the Jackson entertainment industrial-complex. It’s a bold statement that follows in the footsteps of themes shown on Control and Rhythm Nation 1814, but combined with soft gentle touch of some of her more intimate singles like Come Back To Me from the latter album. Singles like *That’s the Way Love Goes* and *Any Time, Any Place* introduced us to this new side of Janet that was as new to us as it was to her. While also exploring a more sensual side to herself, the sonic diversity showed on Rhythm Nation 1814 was still present, while new jack swing has been pushed to the sidelines in favour of a more traditional R&amp;B structure, hip-hop is now fully incorporated into the soundscape with it showing up on the production of the lead single, while Chuck D of Public Enemy shows up on *New Agenda*. House music makes a brief cameo on radio-only single *Throb* which would be a precursor to The Velvet Rope’s *Free Xone* (also known as the best song ever to anyone who’s heard it). There’s even an industrial -dance swerve on the second single *If* which was a hit but should’ve been a much bigger fucking hit for how good it is. \n\nJanet. would go on to deliver Janet Jackson with two more number one singles in America, the lead single *That’s The Way Love Goes* becoming one of her biggest hits ever, and the ballad *Again* which is tied to the film Poetic Justice starring Janet herself and Tupac Shakur. The album produced four other top 10 singles in America and has gone on to be Janet Jackson’s best-selling album worldwide, and hopefully that can translate into a rate win. \n\nNow that’s MESSAGE!\n\nWritten by Flava\n\n**Songlist:** *\n\n1.

    "content": "So every era and decade of pop music obviously has it's trends. There are obvious big overlaps in sound and aesthetic and we usually see a lot of artists adapting to those new trends and it's usually hard to miss. \n\nBut sometimes there are examples of several artists moving in a similar artistic direction at the same time or dealing with the same themes in their songs without it being a big trend. For example, a couple of years ago I noticed a lot of artists were singing about Wabi-sabi. Also about Kintsugi. There were also a lot of songs talking about \"the cracks letting the light in\". I cant't remember all of specific references but it was some bigger names and some up and coming artists. Almost like a lot of people were going through similar things.\n\nThis summer I noticed a lot of pop musicians using fake newspaper clippings for promo. For example Marina for Princess of Power and Allie X for her new project (also Lady Gaga in her \"for your consideration\" box for Grammys). \n\nAre there any similar cases you know of? Where different artists had similar ideas or were singing about same things and themes? Or maybe some weird marketing trends that a couple of artists used but not a lot of people noticed?",

While I’m waiting\r\nfor tour dates to be announced, I started thinking about how to get tickets for big-name tours in\r\ngeneral. Every time I try for big shows, I end up in the virtual queue for an hour only to see\r\n“platinum” or resale listings pop up before I even get through.\n\r\nI’m fine paying face value, it just feels like it’s impossible to get decent seats anymore unless\r\nyou have some kind of presale magic. I’ve never really tried to get presale tickets, it seems\r\ncomplicated. But with rumors about this tour, I want to up my game.\n\r\nIf you’ve managed to score good seats for major arena shows, HOW did you do it?\n\r\nWhat insider tricks should I know before the next wave of tour announcements drops?\n\r\nLast time I gave up and watched TikToks from the nosebleeds.\n\r\nI don’t want to do that again!

If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1oc0vdk/the_popheads_charts_october_20th_2025_fancy_some/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

    "content": "I feel like there is a lot of discussion on this subreddit about songwriting and production credits, but I feel like we very rarely talk about pop artists who are genuinely talented instrumentalists and can compose nice tracks. Or, people who could sit down with an instrument and play it in the studio for their own and for other people's records. Or artists who play instruments outside of their own live performances and are in bands for other artists or play gigs for other artists.\n\nOn the top of my head I can think of these pop and pop adjacent artists:\n\n1. Billie Eilish: Played keyboards and synths on her last album\n\n2. Natalie Mering aka Weyes Blood: She played the guitar and piano on In The Darkness, Hearts Aglow.\n\n3. Haim: Danielle and Alana play the guitar on all Haim records, Alana does the keys on all of them, and Este does the Bass and they all play drums on their records.\n\n4. St. Vincent: She's otherworldly, she played almost everything but strings and wind instruments on her first two albums, and she plays the guitars and synths on her newer albums.\n\n5. Bruno Mars: He played the guitars and other plucked instruments on An Evening with Silk Sonic\n\n6. Laufey: She plays Cello and Piano on her records.",

However,there are albums that came close if it wasn’t for that one song that doesn’t compare to the other ones. I sill say Thank U Next is a perfect album without “Make up”, that just don’t compare but it’s still my favorite Ariana album.\n\nWhat about you? What are some songs that would be perfect if not for that one or few songs?",

    "title": "15 years ago, Taylor Swift released Speak Now",
    "content": "On October 25, 2010, Taylor Swift released her album [Speak Now](https://imgur.com/a/5nzoisQ ). The album was Swift’s third album and her follow up to her mega successful album Fearless. Swift wrote the album by herself (with the exception of If This Was A Movie). The album mostly about heartbreak and reflections on broken relationships, and some tracks were inspired by Swift’s rising stardom in the public eye to address her critics and adversaries. \n\n5 singles were released from the standard version of the album and six overall (one single is from the deluxe edition of the album). [Mine](https://youtu.be/XPBwXKgDTdE) was the first single from the album and would become the album’s biggest hit peaking at #3 on the Hot 100 and #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart. The second single [Back to December](https://youtu.be/QUwxKWT6m7U) would peak at #6 on the Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot Country Songs charts. The third single [Mean](https://youtu.be/jYa1eI1hpDE) would peak at #11 on the Hot 100 and #2 on the Hot Country Songs charts. [The Story of Us](https://youtu.be/nN6VR92V70M) would peak at #41 on the Hot 100.

    "content": "With the new release of Demi Lovato, I’ve been thinking about how there’s a big difference between artists who experiment because they want to vs artists who experiment because they don’t know what to stick with yet.\n\nSome artists change their sound or genre every album, but it always feels intentional — like they’re just having fun or exploring new ideas. Some clear examples this are Madonna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift. Each era sounds different, but it still feels like them. You can tell they’re confident in the chaos.\n\nThen there are artists who also switch it up a lot, but it feels more like they’re searching for something that clicks. It’s not necessarily a bad thing — but you can kinda tell when someone isn't really confident with their sound yet. They’re trying pop one album, alt the next, maybe a dance single after that, and it just doesn’t connect in the same way. That is exactly how I personally with Demi. I do listen to Demi a lot but I also do feel like she doesn't really know what to do and tries to somehow follow the current trend with each of her albums. Her run from Teen-Rock to Pop to EDM to R&amp;B to Hard Rock to Dance doesn't feel smooth to me.\n\nIt’s interesting because on the surface both types of artists are “experimenting,” but the intention behind it feels totally different. One is curiosity and growth, the other is uncertainty and trial-and-error.\n\nWhat are some examples of artists you think like trying new stuff vs artists who are still figuring out who they are sonically?",

    "content": "A little game inspired by some cute and compelling-in-hindsight reviews I've been reading recently—post as a top-level comment a review or article quote about an artist **made 10 years ago or earlier,** and we'll all see if we can guess to whom it refers.\n\nI will start us off with three different artists whose names I'm sure everyone here knows...\n\n&gt;*The music industry’s collapse may have seemed like a dress rehearsal for the current financial meltdown, but there are still stars in the business, and there is an interesting trend in both number and gender: the popular groups are male—Nickelback, Coldplay, the Eagles. The solo stars now, though, are more likely to be women: Alicia Keys, Carrie Underwood, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and* ***\\[Artist A\\]*** *(who probably won’t need that surname for long). Her self-titled début album, released when she was sixteen, has been on the charts for two years. It is triple platinum and still rests, impressively, at No. 31 on the Billboard 200. \\[She\\] wrote or co-wrote every song on the album, one when she was twelve. ...\\[Artist A\\] is not an agent of revolution; she, much like Beyoncé, is a preternaturally skilled student of established values. Her precociousness isn’t about her chart success, but lies in the quality of her work, how fully she’s absorbed the lessons of her elders and how little she seems to care which radio format will eventually claim her. Change the beat and the instruments around the voice, and her songs could work anywhere.*\n\n—From an article on Artist A's rise by Sasha Frere-Jones for the New Yorker\n\n&gt;*The teenage heartthrob who cut through the fourth-quarter clutter with the pop/R&amp;B single \\[\"Lead Single\"\\] delivers her debut album, a top 40-ready workout filled with hook-laden songs from the same bag as the title cut. Blessed with a sweet voice and a wholesome, girl-next-door image,* ***\\[Artist B\\]*** *has hit a nerve among a teen fan base primed by the likes of Hanson, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys... Although much of the world will be introduced to \\[Artist B\\] by this album, she already tasted the limelight in a two-year run on \\[television show\\]. A talent to watch.*\n\n—Billboard review of Artist B's debut album\n\n&gt;*I actually enjoy a good portion of this album. It's a bubblegum pop record that includes some infectious music that make you want to sing along to at high volumes. Some of the material is just throwaway junk but not too many albums don't include crappy filler. The title track is one of the good ones along with the monster single \\[\"Lead Single\"\\] and one of my favorite songs this year \\[\"Second Single\"\\]. If* ***\\[Artist C\\]*** *can continue to write music like these tracks she will have nice little career ahead of her.*\n\n&gt;*She will probably never achieve the hysteria of \\[\"Lead Single\"\\] but she's not going to be a Toni Basil. She's got at minimum five hit singles on this platter and a couple of them have staying power long past their run on pop radio. I would compare this album to Pink's excellent M!ssundaztood or Ashlee Simpson's Autobiography. Not groundbreaking but fun and infectious the way music needs to be sometimes.*\n\n—RateYourMusic review of Artist C's debut major-label album\n\nSee if you can guess the artists above, and post your own redacted quotes below so I can guess yours \\^\\_\\_\\^",

    "content": "Welcome back to the Popheads Jukebox! Here are [the results from last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1o2j7tz/the_popheads_jukebox_revival_week_327_where_is_my/):\n\n* RAYE - WHERE IS MY HUSBAND!: 9.39\n* Madison Beer - yes baby: 7.64\n* XG - GALA: 7.64\n* Miley Cyrus - Secrets (feat. Lindsey Buckingham &amp; Mick Fleetwood): 7.17\n* Allie X - Is Anybody Out There?: 5.25\n\n-\n\n* Adele - Hello: 8.17\n\n\n###Rules Refresher\n\n1. Rate the songs a score from 1 to 10. Please keep it to one decimal place at the most (so 7.5 is fine but 7.58 is not). Also don’t get too hung up on the final scores. This is a fun exercise and not a competition so don’t worry about over/under rating things. Just give what you think the song is to you.\n\n2. For your review, reply to the comment that will be posted by one of us for each song. Avoid posting your reviews as a top level comment cause we probably won’t notice them if you do. Non-reviews such as questions or general commentary as upper level comments are fine.\n\n3. Must have some sort of justification. Try to be a bit more concise than “It’s a bop!” or “I don’t like it”. Explain why! It doesn’t have to be long, two or three sentences can be plenty (though more is definitely allowed). We reserve the right not to include a review in the final total if proper justification is not given.\n\n4. You don’t have to review each song to participate! You can do all of them or only the ones you’re familiar with.\n\n5. The thread will be open for 13 days and close in two Wednesdays around 11PM EST. The scores will be calculated and a new post will come up the next day (Thursday) at 5PM EST(ish) with the next week’s tracks.\n\n---\n\n###This Week’s Tracks\n\n* **[Khalid - out of body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXXgp8XP1E)**\n* **[Magdalena Bay - Second Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAe2faaZ3sY)**\n* **[Taylor Swift - The Fate of Ophelia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko70cExuzZM)**\n* **[Victoria Justice - Love Zombie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-S91K81NRk)**\n* **[Zara Larsson - Midnight Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvY8fdgezLQ)**\n\nThrowback\n\n* **[Justin Bieber - Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRh_vgS2dFE)**\n\n\n—\n\n\n###Next Week\n\n* Doja Cat - Gorgeous\n* Kim Petras - I Like Ur Look\n* Oklou - viscus (feat.

    "title": "Anyone remembers Birdy and Gabrielle Aplin?",
    "content": "I remember back in the first half of the 2010s there was a small but still influential trend of pop ballads leaning towards melodic folk, with artists like Birdy, Gabrielle Aplin, Tom Odell, James Bay, George Ezra, Kodaline, Aurora, Daughter, and Lauren Aquilina. Quite a good number of artists, most of them from the UK (for some reason, British singers always seem more romantic than American ones). The ones that stood out the most for me were the first two: Birdy and Gabrielle Aplin. Both were very young when they became famous. They were pretty much the epitome of the English roses that history and literature books talk about.\n\nI was very young back then too, still a teenager, and when I found out about them, I immediately fell in love with their music. I was still an emo kid, listening to post-hardcore bands like Bring Me the Horizon and Sleeping with Sirens, but when I felt sad and alone, I would open YouTube and tune into their melodic, introspective songs. They always made me feel better. It was my dream back then to attend one of their concerts, to travel to England, and enjoy the English rain. It never happened. Years passed, I became more depressed, and all the big dreams I had -- becoming a poet, a novelist, a musician -- went nowhere. Then the pandemic came and made everything worse. I dropped out of college twice but finally got a degree, and suddenly it was already 2025, and I was 30. For some reason, this autumn -- with its early darkness and distant, fading sun -- made me think of them again. They were around my age, but after their first two albums, it seems like they either stopped making music or never found the same success.\n\nSo, what happened to them? Are there any new musicians in this decade who resemble their sound, that pop, indie-folk magic that mesmerized us with sweet, melodic vocals and that unmistakable British accent that felt straight out of a Jane Austen novel? Is it possible that I could finally become a musician and honor them, releasing an indie folk album that would become a big success? And in some future interview, I would mention them as my main influences, and thank them for making music more poetic, intimate and sincere?",

I can only assume this is because less people are going out to clubs, malls, partys, third spaces as they use too.. so is this the new normal for pop?",

I could see some parallels with pop music and religion: \n\n1) people have unrealistic expectations of their pop girlies to be politically responsible and woke even though humans are not perfect (like the uplifted, pedestaled pastor who gets caught cheating).\n\n2) When you do hear the right song that hits you right, it feels euphoric and you can’t stop playing it over and over (my most recent ones are By the End of the Night by Amber Mark, The Subway, twilight zone, Shapeshifting on a Saturday Night). It almost feels spiritual to have the melodies or lyrics or tone of a voice hit u in that right way. \n\n3) when you sing in a crowd at a concert, it feels akin to a worship night at church. You feel like a part of something bigger and it’s awesome. \n\nWhat are some other ways pop music parallels religion?",

According to a statement, the album “traces a widescreen emotional arc of feminine mystique, transformation, and transcendence — moving between intimacy and operatic scale to create a radiant world where sound, language, and culture fuse as one.”\n\nWhile it’s unclear which songs will feature guests, the press release confirms that the record will include Björk, Portuguese fado singer Carminho, Spanish flamenco star Estrella Morente, Spanish singer Silvia Pérez Cruz, música mexicana star Yahritza, and experimental musician Yves Tumor. The boys choir Escolania de Montserrat i Cor Cambra Palau de la Música Catalana will also be part of the album.\n\nThe album is broken up into four movements, and the physical versions of the LP will include 18 songs while digital versions will include 15. Among the physical exclusives are “Focu ‘Ranni” and “Jeanne” from MOV III, and “Novia Robot” from MOV IV. The album also includes songs titled “Porcelana,” “Mio Cristo,””Memória,” and “La Perla.”",

This week, we have the chart of /u/pm174!\n\nRank|Song|Their Points|Actual Rank|Total Points\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n1|Charli xcx - Girl, so confusing featuring lorde|15.0|#154|143.5\n2|Caroline Polachek - Pang|14.0|#387|58.5\n3|Caroline Polachek - So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings|12.5|#400|56.0\n3|The Japanese House - Touching Yourself|12.5|#571|40.5\n5|Taylor Swift - Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)|10.5|#1458|18.5\n5|Troye Sivan - One Of Your Girls|10.5|#770|31.0\n7|Caroline Polachek - Welcome To My Island|7.0|#559|41.0\n7|Sabrina Carpenter - Tears|7.0|#30|523.5\n7|Taylor Swift - So Long, London|7.0|#1011|25.0\n7|The 1975 - Robbers|7.0|#622|37.0\n7|The Japanese House - Something Has To Change|7.0|#2379|14.5\n\nIf you’d like to have your top 10 shown in a future installment, *PLEASE USE [THIS GOOGLE FORM](https://forms.gle/Mpz5yQXzLyMHJsLJ8)*! Also, if you sign up for this **PLEASE also sign up for the actual charts, with the form found below**. \n\n---\n\n[Here's the current list of people signed up for the charts!](https://pastebin.com/utvJZ08B)  \n\n#If you'd like to sign up for the charts, **[you can sign up here](https://forms.gle/es672tr8jzNwp4Qh6)**!\n \nThe tracking dates for the next weekly chart is **October 16, 12:00 PM GMT - October 23, 11:59 AM GMT** and results will come out next Monday, October 27.\n\n---\n\n##How The Chart Works:\n\nThese charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1o624hp/the_popheads_charts_october_13th_2025_will/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

    "content": "Partially inspired by the rise of Showgirls material I've seen with conjunction of the new Taylor record, it had me thinking what is the best \"so bad it's good\" music/albums of pop music. Something that swung hard only to completely hit another mark. Taylor's Life of a Showgirl feels to predictable to fall into this, but her album Rep has the argument on being in that musical equivalent of camp classic, especially with the whole \"goth punk female range bs\". Are their pop equivalents to these campy bad movies, or does that bad its good mentality not translate over to albums",

    "title": "How much do famous artists ACTUALLY make? Can we get real numbers?",
    "content": "I’m so confused about how much famous artists actually make and I’m hoping someone can break down the real numbers. On one hand, you scroll through Instagram and these musicians are flashing massive watch collections, luxury cars, designer everything, the lifestyle screams money. But then I hear people saying that most artists are actually broke, that they’re just fronting for image, or that the labels take everything and they’re barely scraping by despite millions of streams. So what’s the truth? How much does someone with 10 million monthly Spotify listeners actually take home? Is touring where the real money is? Are these luxury lifestyles even real or is it all rented and borrowed? I keep hearing everything from “streaming pays pennies” to “top artists make $50M+ a year” but nobody ever backs it up with actual data. Does anyone actually have insight into what moderately famous musicians (not Taylor Swift level, but like recognized artists) are really earning?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

    "content": "Now that it's been a year since most of the major albums of 2024, which are you still listening to?\n\nI tend to move very swiftly forwards through music, looping a new song every few days and keeping up with weekly album releases, so I haven't had a lot of albums from last year on what one might call \"regular rotation.\" With that said, I have re-listened to some in full, and a few songs made it onto various playlists and came up on autoplay enough for me to sift through my listening metrics out of curiosity.\n\nMy personal most-played 2024 releases in 2025 (not including, e.g., singles for 2025 albums or 2024 albums I heard *for the first time* in 2025):\n\n* ***BRAT*** simply has a lot to offer, so I keep switching my favorite tracks off the record and looping new ones. I didn't understand the \"Everything is romantic\" hype until this year, but now I adore both versions!\n* ***C,XOXO*** has been my surprise recommendation to a *lot* of people; I keep telling people to listen to it using my tracklist order and then just sitting down and doing the same myself. I prefer to listen to the whole thing together as one journey, so it doesn't happen too often, but I have made a lot of time for this album just for how it makes me feel.\n* ***Radical Optimism*** was simply confusing to me on first listen given the promotion and description, but now that I've returned to it, I find it really pleasant and a lovely summer listen! Shout out to everyone who was saying this on release day in the thread; I needed some time to come to the same conclusion.\n* ***Big Ideas*** is similarly summerful; I started itching to play a couple of songs in April and finally got the chance to put it on all the way through around a fire pit over drinks in July. This might become a yearly tradition; it's just so satisfying.\n* ***The Great Impersonator*** has a lot of songs that work for this nostalgic 2000s acoustic phase I've been in this year; it's very pleasant to listen to when I need to slow down and stop dancing. Alternatively, sometimes you just need to cry very hard.\n\n**What are you still listening to?** And if you're listening to too many 2024 albums to count, or just have a different listening style than me (which is most people!), **what has revealed new depths to you over the past year? What do you think will continue to age well and be meaningful to you?**",

Addison Rae, Miley Cyrus, Lorde, Sabrina, neither of them really dominated the conversation although they each had their moments. I’d say that this year was mostly centered around Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift but I’d love to read your opinions !",

The reason being is that I’m no longer in that space I was when the album came out because when was released I just got out of the toxic decade of friendship and I can relate to most of the songs like such as I wish I hated you bye and don’t wanna break up again,but now I can’t really play those songs cause I’m no longer in that headspace. I will say I can play the songs, but it doesn’t hit the same if that makes sense. What about you? \n\nAre there any albums that you can’t really play because you’re no longer sad or happy or whatever reason?",

    "content": "Love and romance is obviously a common subject in pop (perhaps...the most common? A discussion point in itself) but what do we thing is the most referenced stage in relationships? \n\nThe breakup song is obviously a phenomenon in itself -  countless artists have written about the immediate aftermath. Usually this takes the form of wanting someone back, asking what went wrong, or a sassy kiss-off that their ex was never what they wanted anyway. (Consider Hello by Adele, All Too Well by Taylor, or Manchild by Sabrina). \n\nThere's also your classic falling-in-love or I'm-so-lucky song - Ordinary by Alex Warren, Audrey Hepburn by Maisie Peters, countless Ed Sheeran wedding songs. Or the \"what are we??\" song, like Casual by Chappell Roan, or Call Me Maybe by CRJ. Or the \"apologies for what happened\" song, like Back to December by Taylor or Sorry by Justin Bieber. \n\nPersonally I love a \"the relationship is over but we haven't called it quits yet\" song - think Hard Feelings by Lorde or You're Losing Me by Taylor. \n\nSo - what's your favourite part of a relationship to be explored? What are your favourite niche situations to be captured in 3.5 minutes of catchy melodies?",

Tbh i can only think of Ariana at this point.\n\nWhy there are no singers like Whitney, Celine, Beyonce etc. anymore??\n\nEDIT: If you think Sabrina is a vocalist, then you don’t understand my question…\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for all the reactions! Its interesting to see your opions. Also the fact that i think some singers are no power house vocalists (Sabrina, Dua) doesnt mean i dont like them! For me a vocalist is belting, high (and low) notes, runs and riffs, control, vibrato and agility.",

He has demonstrated the rare ability to adapt with the times (his first #1 was \"...Baby One More Time\" by Britney, which was recorded in 1998), but the question is, with which artist(s) can he collaborate to help him achieve this, and how long will it take him?",

This week, we have the chart of /u/tylerf98!\n\nRank|Song|Their Points|Actual Rank|Total Points\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n1|RAYE - WHERE IS MY HUSBAND!|14.5|#16|966.0\n1|Sammy Virji - Survive|14.5|#2139|14.5\n3|Max Dean - Gets Like That|12.5|#3302|12.5\n3|Sammy Virji - Burn The River|12.5|#3302|12.5\n5|Anyma - Girls MIA|7.5|#3515|12.0\n5|Chris Lake - LA NOCHE|7.5|#516|36.5\n5|Doja Cat - Cards|7.5|#39|387.5\n5|Doja Cat - Gorgeous|7.5|#19|787.5\n5|Madison Beer - yes baby|7.5|#46|348.0\n5|Magdalena Bay - Second Sleep|7.5|#33|441.0\n5|Rochelle Jordan - Doing It Too|7.5|#41|382.5\n5|Zara Larsson - Blue Moon|7.5|#22|645.0\n\n\nIf you’d like to have your top 10 shown in a future installment, *PLEASE USE [THIS GOOGLE FORM](https://forms.gle/Mpz5yQXzLyMHJsLJ8)*! Also, if you sign up for this **PLEASE also sign up for the actual charts, with the form found below**. \n\n---\n\n[Here's the current list of people signed up for the charts!](https://pastebin.com/utvJZ08B)  \n\n#If you'd like to sign up for the charts, **[you can sign up here](https://forms.gle/es672tr8jzNwp4Qh6)**!\n \nThe tracking dates for the next weekly chart is **October 9, 12:00 PM GMT - October 16, 11:59 AM GMT** and results will come out next Monday, October 20.\n\n---\n\n##How The Chart Works:\n\nThese charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1o01rls/the_popheads_charts_october_6th_2025_zara_and/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

It was only for 18+ initially, but Avril made it open to all by request and she played a free concert.\n\nWorst was Gene Simmons.Not Pop I know, but KISS is a popular band so I guess it counts.He's a creep and makes everybody feel uncomfortable, especially women. Won't go into details but yeah, he's notorious for this.",

    "content": "So I've listened to every Kylie Minogue album but yesterday when I was trying to listen to her song \"The One\" I accidentally stumbled across a song called [\"I Am The One For You,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYtEdrDWB7E) a house banger from the early '90s that I had no clue existed! It was apparently a B-side for the single release of [\"Shocked\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwYB-DVS27k) and it just made me think about how cool it is that I've been a dedicated fan of Kylie for years now and have actively tried to listen to as much of her music as I can, and yet I'm still finding new little songs hidden away. Her discography is so deep and she's been around for so many different release formats that there's always some B-side or remix or compilation single or something waiting out there to be discovered.\n\nThis is an experience I have specifically with Kylie, and it got me thinking... what are other unique factors that you find \"rewarding\" about being a fan of a specific artist? Obviously we're fans of artists because we like their music, but is there anything else about them that gives them that special little edge and gives you a unique experience with them, specifically?\n\nFor example, one of the benefits of being a Mariah Carey fan is that she cares a lot about honoring her past music, so she's great about releasing tasteful anniversary versions of her albums that are remastered and include new remixes and unreleased songs. Another benefit is that she takes remixes very seriously, so she has lots of remix albums/EPs that are worth listening to.\n\nWould love to hear other things people like about being fans of their faves!",

    "content": "I've been thinking about this recently after Charli XCX finally wrested control from her label to create *BRAT* (2024) only after doing *Crash* (2022) essentially entirely to her label's specifications and having it underperform compared to their expectations. **EDIT: So I completely misremembered this story. To everyone wondering why I was very wrong about this, that is why. I'm sorry! Thanks to those who corrected me in the comments; you should read their comments.**\n\nKim Petras is now having a similar experience on a similar timeline—after years of scrapped albums (\\~2019-2022), she did exactly what her label asked with *Feed the Beast* (2023)*,* which underperformed, which seems to have allowed her to make some kind of bargain where they give her no money and she does the kind of (harsher, weirder) music she wants currently (without a single credit from Dr. Luke!) While it's not getting the critical or commercial success of *BRAT,* it seems artistically more true to what she wants to be doing, and the fans are happy again.\n\nToday I realized Britney Spears had a similar arc—after years of the conservatorship, with the bombing of *Britney Jean* (2013), she was finally able to convince the team to let her have somewhat more control over *Glory* (2016), which she remains incredibly proud of. Despite the album not doing as well commercially as some of her others, again, it was obviously more in line with what she wanted, and the superfans were (and are!) very happy with it.\n\n**Who are some other artists who had to let a project underperform in order to get enough control to do what they wanted?**",

For additional context, please read [this introductory post](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1nt8tzn/ratricks_revenge_an_introduction/) from the start of the event. There's also a full fanfiction that accompanies the rate that expounds upon the lore of St. Ratrick, which I will link after I finish uploading it to AO3.\n\nIf you're completely lost and do not know what a rate is, check this [30 second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UifAv-gVqI0) or [6 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1SDlLZcpM) tutorial video.\n\nOne thing to note is that this is our third ever flash rate! A flash rate is just like a normal rate, except it is only open for a very limited time and reveals all in one day. As such, **this rate will be due in less than 72 hours.** It will then reveal within hours of the scores being due.\n\nWithout further ado, this flash rate is OPEN!\n\n---\n\n# Songlist\n\nThe winners of each of the games, plus the creative contributors to the rate, each got to submit one song that fit the following moodboard:\n\n* revenge\n* darkness\n* sadness\n* negativity\n* \"gone bad\" (Rihanna/Reputation style)\n\nHere is what they came up with:\n\n1. 070 Shake - Elephant\n2. 5 Seconds of Summer - Voodoo Doll\n3. Adele - Set Fire to the Rain\n4. Akini Jing - Villain (feat. Tee Zandos)\n5. Bebe Rexha - Sacrifice\n6. Beyoncé - Don't Hurt Yourself (feat. Jack White)\n7. Charli xcx - Sympathy is a knife\n8. Dolly Parton - Baby I'm Burnin'\n9. Dreamcatcher - Chase Me\n10. Femtanyl - Murder Every 1 U Know! (feat. Takihasdied)\n11. Imogen Heap - Hide and Seek\n12. Metric - Die Happy\n13.

Taylor Swift - All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\n25. The Chicks - Goodbye Earl\n\n---\n\n# Copypasted Rules\n\n* Listen to every song and score each 1 to 10. You can use decimals to one point, meaning 7.5 is acceptable, but 7.75 is not.\n\n* Score every song without skipping any. I won't be able to record your ballot if it's not completely filled out. If you accidentally miss any songs, I'll send a DM asking you to correct it, but given the short timetable of this rate, this is riskier than usual as you will have less time to correct your mistake.\n\n* Use the formatted ballot to submit your scores. Rates use a program that requires properly formatted ballots, so it's easiest for everyone if you use it!

    "content": "Welcome back to the Popheads Jukebox! Here are [the results from last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1nqie55/the_popheads_jukebox_revival_week_326_i_get_wet/?):\n\n* Sabrina Carpenter - Tears: 8.75\n* JADE - Unconditional: 7.64\n* CMAT - When A Good Man Cries: 7.33\n* Lady Gaga - The Dead Dance: 7.20\n\n\\-\n\n* Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine - Conga: 9.07\n\n\n###Rules Refresher\n\n1. Rate the songs a score from 1 to 10. Please keep it to one decimal place at the most (so 7.5 is fine but 7.58 is not). Also don’t get too hung up on the final scores. This is a fun exercise and not a competition so don’t worry about over/under rating things. Just give what you think the song is to you.\n\n2. For your review, reply to the comment that will be posted by one of us for each song. Avoid posting your reviews as a top level comment cause we probably won’t notice them if you do. Non-reviews such as questions or general commentary as upper level comments are fine.\n\n3. Must have some sort of justification. Try to be a bit more concise than “It’s a bop!” or “I don’t like it”. Explain why! It doesn’t have to be long, two or three sentences can be plenty (though more is definitely allowed). We reserve the right not to include a review in the final total if proper justification is not given.\n\n4. You don’t have to review each song to participate! You can do all of them or only the ones you’re familiar with.\n\n5. The thread will be open for 13 days and close in two Wednesdays around 11PM EST. The scores will be calculated and a new post will come up the next day (Thursday) at 5PM EST(ish) with the next week’s tracks.\n\n---\n\n###This Week’s Tracks\n\n* **[Allie X - Is Anybody Out There?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RUjfajOqmc)**\n* **[Madison Beer - yes baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFmNWm60bjA)**\n* **[Miley Cyrus - Secrets (feat.

Like, any level of \"star\".\n\nI understand it's completely dependent on the level of success, the time period (like someone selling loads of physical copies in 1999 would have made a lot more money than someone today relying on streams), the specific record deal, the amount of touring and merchandising etc. and even then I imagine it must be so difficult to measure exactly because there's so many income streams and it's very volatile...but there's also (understandably) a lot of hush hush surrounding it. I'd still be curious if someone has ever given concrete actual numbers. Most of the figures I see are just the net worth estimations from Forbes and the likes which are obviously just a general guesstimate.",

In normal weeks, songs are sometimes several months or over a year old. It's become very stale. There's also double counting between B200/BH100.",
    "content": "Here's my proposed fix.\n\n**BILLBOARD 200** (ALBUMS)\n\n* Only 4 variants are allowed for the life of an album\n   * Example: *Sandbox* (Standard Edition), *Sandbox* (Deluxe Edition), *Sandbox* (Deluxe Edition - Clean), *Sandbox* (Anniversary Edition)\n   * The reason being that it forces labels to be strategic on how they utilize their variant strategy. Do they want to release the same album in different colors? Or do they want to reserve it for later to offer outtakes/extra tracks?\n* Clean / Edit Versions of an album count as a variant\n   * Some artists are forcing swearing on songs just so they can issue a separate SKU for the clean version. This closes that loophole. This rule also forces artists to think, \"Do I really need to swear here? Do I want to use 1 variant slot to release a clean version? Or do I release all variants in explicit and just issue clean versions for singles?\"\n* Each variant is allowed to be released in 4 different physical formats + 1 digital\n   * Example: *Sandbox* (Standard Edition) can be released in CD, CD+DVD, Cassette, Vinyl and Digital. Same as the other editions. The artist doesn't have to do all. They just have the option.\n* Only two variants at launch; sales from excess variants will not be counted\n* Six months from the original release, the artist can utilize their remaining two variants if they choose\n* Sales from variants in excess of 4 are not counted towards the charts\n   * Eligible variants are taken from order of release/announcement. If that data isn't available, they will be sorted alphabetically based on variant name. If there is no variant name, the sorting will be on catalog number.\n\n**BILLBOARD HOT 100** (SINGLES)\n\n* Artists are required to issue a \"single page\" for their singles during their respective campaign period\n   * Example: \"The Life of a Snowgirl - Single\"\n* Once the promo campaign for their chosen single is done, the artists can remove the \"single page\"\n* Only three singles from the same album can be active at a time; if they want to issue a new single, they must remove one of the active \"single pages\"\n* Clean versions are not counted towards their 3-singles-at-a-time quota\n* **Streaming:**\n   * ONLY *active singles* will be counted towards the Hot 100\n   * *Active singles* will ONLY be counted towards the Hot 100, not the Billboard 200\n   * Non-singles and *inactive singles* are counted towards Billboard 200\n* **Digital store purchases:** Song purchases remain as is. They are counted towards the Hot 100 regardless of if they are a single or not.\n\n**GENERAL CHANGES**\n\n* Consumers can only purchase a maximum of 2 copies per order per week (albums / physical singles), or 1 copy per order per week per account (digital).\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Was thinking about how there’s been conversation around Taylor with TLOAS and the album being a lot of cutesy love songs, which people think don’t live up to her other songs lyrically. \n\nSo I wanna know, what artists do you all think make the best love songs about romance? Like I love you so much, you’re the love of my life type or songs? And what songs from them would you recommend?",

    "content": "Recently, Ghostface Killah cancelled his tour and claimed it was because of the government shutdown, which makes no sense. A lot of people compared it to Joey Badass dropping out of Logic's tour and saying he got eye damage from looking at the solar eclipse (he later admitted that wasn't true, he just didn't want to do the tour anymore).\n\nThis got me wondering about the dumbest and most obvious lies told by popstars.

    "content": "With the rise of multiple album variants from every artist or band, why don’t music services let you pick which one you like as a feature? \n\n\nBack in the day, artist had one main photo for their cover with a possible deluxe version which sometimes would be the same cover with deluxe added on. But nowadays with all different variants being released, wouldn’t it make sense for Spotify to have a feature where it lets you pick which one? I know you can make playlists with different covers, or download the files and make a certain cover what you’d like. \n\nWould this be something you would want to see? The variants and multiple covers have been popular mostly since 2020, and I think for a more personal experience as consumers we should be able to choose what cover we like the most. I really don’t think artists can say “well I want the main cover to represent the album” when they release so many different covers to choose and purchase from, when most of us don’t listen to physical music and mostly buy them to support the artist when we are mostly streaming in this day and age. That’s why I personally like purchasing physical music for how personable it feels and I think music services need something that isn’t a cash grab to make streaming feel more personal. Even as a pro feature. \n\n\nThere are Spotify variants of albums that artists do for their cd or vinyl pressings but I think such a simple feature would feel nice if an artist chooses to do so. For example with the recent release of show girl, Taylor has over 20 covers to choose from with deluxe, online only etc. I know these are cash grabs to get more sales but I would personally enjoy the it’s beautiful variant on streaming, or the red lipstick vinyl pressing.",

    "content": "Earlier today, I decided to listen and compare Taylor Swift's recently released album, The Life Of A Showgirl in both versions.\n\nI think in my opinion, the clean version is better because she goes overboard when it comes to using explicit words and when she doesn't use it, she sounds more creative and deeper for me. I also think it's because she's showing it, not telling it.\n\nFor example:\nOn the chorus of the song \"Wood\", she said:\n\nAll of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star\nNever did me any good\nI ain't got to knock on wood\nIt's you and me forever dancing in the dark\nAll over me, it's understood\nI ain't got to knock on wood\nForgive me, it sounds cocky\nHe **dickmatized** me\nAnd opened my eyes\nRedwood tree\nIt ain't hard to see\nHis love was the key\nThat opened my thighs\n\nBut then, on the cleaner verson, she said:\n\n(Ah) All of that missin', wishing on a falling star\nNever did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood\n(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark\nAll over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood\nForgive me, it sounds cocky\nHe **hypnotised** me and opened my eyes\nRedwood tree, it ain't hard to see\nHis love was the key that opened my skies\n\nThe cleaner version sounds better because she's showing everyone what she's feeling over the love that Travis is giving her, while still being subtle about it and the cleaner version also ties back to the earlier song on the tracklist, Opalite, where she sang:\n\n\nBut my Mama told me, \"It's alright\nYou were dancing through the lightning strikes\nSleepless in the onyx night\nBut now the sky is opalite\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh my Lord\nNever made no one like you before\nYou had to make your own sunshine\nBut now the sky is opalite\"\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh\n\n-------------------------\nAlso, in the song Father Figure, she sang at the explicit version:\n\nI'll be your father figure\nI drink that brown liquor\nI can make deals with the devil because my **dick's** bigger\nThis love is pure profit\nJust step into my office\nI dry your tears with my sleeve\n\nWhile in the clean version, she sang:\n\nI'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor\nI can make deals with the devil because my **check’s** bigger\nThis love is pure profit, just step into my office\nI dry your tears with my sleeve\n\nI think the cleaner version is better because she's singing in the perspective of a powerful person instead of a dick-measuring contest.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

Also, if you sign up for this **PLEASE also sign up for the actual charts, with the form found below**. \n\n---\n\n[Here's the current list of people signed up for the charts!](https://pastebin.com/utvJZ08B)  \n\n#If you'd like to sign up for the charts, **[you can sign up here](https://forms.gle/es672tr8jzNwp4Qh6)**!\n \nThe tracking dates for the next weekly chart is **October 2, 12:00 PM GMT - October 9, 11:59 AM GMT** and results will come out next Monday, October 13.\n\n---\n\n##How The Chart Works:\n\nThese charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1ntzpeq/the_popheads_charts_september_29th_2025_where_is/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

    "content": "My theory is that iconic artists always have 2 distinct genres/styles, and the way they “blend” them makes them iconic. One is more for radio (the genre that gets the big budget music videos), and one is for storytelling/songwriting (getting to know the artist). \n\nThe Weeknd: 80s synth / dark r&amp;b\n\nLady Gaga: electro pop / soft rock ballads\n\nDrake: dance-hall pop / classic rap\n\nTaylor: max martin synth pop / folk country pop\n\nBillie: avant garde dark music / soft pop\n\nBruno Mars: funky disco / sappy ballads\n\nThe list could go on. But I’ve noticed that more unique the mix, the faster the artist becomes “big”. Often times these artists aren’t reinventing the wheel, but rather the unique combination of these 2 genres makes them “them”. \n\nAlso you’ll notice that sometimes, when an artist has their breakthrough moment, it’s often due to finding that “second genre” that makes them really unique. (Sabrina and Post Malone with country, for example)\n\nAnd often artsts who only have 1 main genre that they are known for are not taken as seriously as artists, or are seen as one dimensional. (Think Tyla or Halsey or Camila Cabello - they have hit potential and name recognition but need that “second genre” to add dimension to their artistry.)",

    "title": "20 Years of Fiona Apple's Extraordinary Machine",
    "content": "[On October 4, 2005 Fiona Apple released Extraordinary Machine](https://preview.redd.it/ebx6mhby58tf1.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f64c5a7ecd1bb06011bd68e6cccc59578ae54df)\n\n**Prelude:**\n\nFiona Apple shot into the spotlight in 90s with her sharp lyrics, her sharp speeches and her great music. As was common back then, she wasn't taken seriously by critics back then as a woman who wrote her own music and her involvement as often questioned [and much of her genius was credited to Jon Brion](https://americansongwriter.com/jon-brion-on-producing-fiona-apple/). Fiona recorded Extraordinary Machine with Jon Brion, and the Jon Brion version leaked fully in the middle of label drama while Fiona was rerecording the album with Mike Elizondo and Brian Kehew. The Jon Brion version was dramatic and full of strings and much loved by fans and some critics, but Fiona was not happy with how it turned out and didn't consider it finished. She rerecorded the album to be more in line with her later works with experimental percussion and focus on her own piano skills.\n\n  \n**Album:**\n\nExtraordinary Machine is an extraordinary album. The official version of the album has 12 tracks, all written by Fiona and all but two produced by Mike Elizondo and Brian Kehew. Extraordinary Machine and Waltz (Better than Fine) were produced by Jon Brion, and feature lush, sweeping strings and grand orchestral arrangements. \n\nGet Him Back is a masterpiece about revenge on her ex she gracefully refused to name. The song is driven by heavy percussion and piano. She flips the script during the last chorus and makes it a song about getting back with her ex. This song would inspire several generations of pop girls to make their own versions of this song, including Alecia Cara, Taylor Swift, and Olivia Rodrigo- the last two would even reference the song in the song title.\n\n  \nThe focus on experimental production continues onto Tymps, which also features fuzzy synths, mellotron and programmed drums along with tacked pianos.\n\nParting Gift is was a new song as a stripped back song with almost no instruments other than Fiona's voice and a piano while she was rerecording the album. This is the most \"Fiona Apple\" song of the album. The drama in the song isn't a result of the production choices or arrangements but a result of Fiona emoting through her voice and playing with the dynamics of the instruments she controls.  \n\n\nWindow, Oh Well, Please Please Please, and Red Red Red continue the focus on percussion and Fiona's voice with support from guitars and piano as well as the occasional organs and bass.  \n\n\nThe climax of the album is Not About Love, the best song on the album in my opinion. And this song is also the climax of Fiona's clash of vision with the production of Jon Brion, the official release of this song is the most different from Jon Brion's version. The officially released version of the song is angry, with heavy piano and drums and expresses the emotions of the song through songwriting and vocals alone. The Jon Brion version of the song features a very prominent strings playing along with piano which overshadow's Fionas piano as well as her voice and creates a melodramatic soundscape where Fiona plays second fiddle to a very prominent cello. Mike's drums on the other hand compliment Fiona's piano and vocals very nicely and she gets to shine in her own song.  \n\n\nJon Brion finally returns to the album in the closer, Waltz which starts quite minimalistic compared to the bootlegged album songs, over the course of the song it features a nice piano melody, faint organ and drum and very prominent strings orchestrated by Patrick Warren.\n\n  \n**The Response:**\n\n  \nThe album was a critical smash, and the official version topped the best albums of the years list published by New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, and Slant. It also ranked high in the year end list published by Blender magazine, Rolling Stone, Los Angeles Times, Spin, and The Village Voice.\n\n  \nPitchfork, in their contrarianness and \\[dissmissal of Fiona's artistic integrity\\](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/247-when-the-pawn/) ranked the leaked version of the album on their year end list, and called the official version a \"rehash\". \n\n  \nCommercially the album as hurt by the bootlegged version leaking but it still did fine and sold 1 million copies and was certified gold by RIAA.\n\n  \n**The Legacy and Future:**\n\n  \nExtraordinary Machine is the sound of Fiona Apple refusing to be contained by her fans' or producer's expectations and releasing what she wanted to release. Twenty years later, Extraordinary Machine is still a pivotal album for 2000s music. It has inspired generations of songwriters, and the soundscape explored by Fiona Apple would be fleshed out in The Idler Wheel and Fetch The Bolt Cutters. Keys and drums would become more and more prominent in records, with The Idler Wheel being produced primarily by the pianist Feedy and drummer Seedy. Fiona would take greater role in production of her later records and her vision would bring her widespread critical acclaim, especially when she would distill her sound to perfection with Fetch the Bolt Cutters which is the second highest rated album of all time on Metacritic.",

    "title": "Music Nerd Approved K-Pop Rate (f(x) vs Wonder Girls vs LOONA / ODD EYE CIRCLE vs Red Velvet vs YUKIKA)",
    "content": "Onion haseyo yeorobum\n\nIt’s a pleasure for u/rickikardashian and I to present to you…\n\n## The Music Nerd Approved K-Pop Rate!\n\nA rate consisting of 5 of the most acclaimed K-Pop projects in online circles.\n\n---\n\n# f(x) - Pink Tape\n\nThe first project in this lineup is from perhaps one of the first K-pop artists to garner critical clout in the Anglosphere. While SM Entertainment's Girls' Generation indulged in every sort of style across mainstream music with a bubblegum twist, f(x) were the edgier, experimental counterpart who traversed the extremes of electronic dance-pop. Pink Tape was their sophomore album, and remains a touchstone not just for the recognition of K-pop in English publications but also for the potential that remains in Korean pop.\n\nPerhaps what has allowed Pink Tape to remain so relevant is its representation of the unique quirks one can only find in K-pop. Take, for example, \"Shadow\", which marries a stalker narrative to a bouncy electronic beat for an eerie take on electropop that has few other parallels. The interpolation of \"Little Drummer Boy\" on \"Rum Pum Pum Pum\" alongside a cultural potpourri of other influences allows for f(x) to develop one of the most novel title tracks in K-pop history. Elsewhere on the album their muse guides them towards Sleigh Bells-esque chanting, ethereal electro house, and cutesy doo-wop pastiche. While f(x) are no longer active, their influence remains undeniable among every generation of K-pop that follows them.\n\n# Wonder Girls - REBOOT\n\nAs somebody growing up in an Asian American community, I was passingly familiar with K-pop exports; I remember having an elementary school friend tell me to listen to SHINee, and adoring the clamorousness of Girls' Generation's \"The Boys.\" Yet the one K-pop group that has remained in my consciousness the longest was the ever-retro, internationally beloved Wonder Girls. To younger me, \"Nobody\" was the barometer to which every Korean crossover would be compared; it was the first single from a Korean pop act to enter the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nWonder Girls debuted in 2007 as the flagship girl group of JYP with five members: Sunye, Hyuna, Sunmi, Sohee, and Yeeun. Shortly before their debut album, Hyuna would drop out due to health issues (she would later join the girl group 4Minute and debut solo with \"Bubble Pop!\", a song which would be parodied on Family Guy, if that's your bag), and she was replaced with Yubin prior to their debut album. Their singles \"Tell Me\" and the aforementioned \"Nobody\" would launch viral dance crazes, and polls from Gallup Korea would rank them as the Singer of the Year in 2007 and 2008. 2009, the year which Google suggests begins the steady climb of searches for K-pop, marks the beginning of Wonder Girls' stint as an opening act for the Jonas Brothers. In 2010, Sunmi would leave the group to be replaced by Hyerim. Their TeenNick debut would arrive two years later. Five years later, following a three year hiatus, Sunmi would return as Sunye and Sohee departed.\n\nThus begins the journey towards Wonder Girls' third and final album, the aptly titled Reboot. Promotional materials would embrace their new concept as a bona fide band; although they did not play the instruments on the studio recording, every member would have production and writing credits throughout Reboot, and the group would perform their instruments live. The album was a revelation, both a revision of what Wonder Girls were and a true reboot of the sounds of the 1980s. Single \"I Feel You\" would be a proper tribute to the excitement of freestyle music, while \"Rewind\" brought back the swingbeat slow jams of the early '90s. \"Back\" paid homage to old school hip hop, while \"One Black Night\" had all the excitement of '80s anthems like Michael Sembello's \"Maniac.\" Reboot is a hallmark of K-pop not just for its excellent production value, not just for its effortless pastiches of bygone eras, but also for its representation of exactly what great music can come about as a result of creative input from K-pop idols themselves.\n\n\n# LOONA/ODD EYE CIRCLE - Max &amp; Match\n\nstan loona\n\n\n\n\n# Red Velvet - The Perfect Red Velvet\n\nAt the end of 2019, Billboard released a list of the greatest K-pop songs of the decade to slight mutterings of approval. #1 was IU's \"Good Day,\" which, I fear, has nothing to do with this rate, but just beneath it was a marvelous tune by none other than the girl group Red Velvet. The writer of the blurb off-handedly describes Red Velvet as \"the best idol group alive,\" the torch having been passed down from f(x) presumably in some elaborate SM Entertainment ritual. While the statement remains a bit of insane hyperbole, their catalog is the perfect rebuttal to any skepticism that they haven't earned their place in the K-pop pantheon.\n\nWith their debut album The Red embracing the exuberant, energetic \"Red\" side of their concept, Red Velvet's sophomore record Perfect Velvet exists as the sultry, sensual counterpart representing their \"Velvet\" side. Coming off of the success of their joyous \"Red Flavor\" summer single, expectations were higher than ever for a new full-length album, especially as previous singles had indulged further and further in the mania of bombastic pop. As further visual teasers for the album dropped, the contrast was evident: in lieu of campy fruit interviews, they were embracing campy horror poster graphics complete with blood spatters. While the group had always had an element of unease in their music, with the video for title track \"Peek-a-Boo\" they expanded upon the slapstick murder concept of \"Russian Roulette\" into a creepier, almost \"elevated horror\"-esque tale of homicide. The songs on the album ranged from more overtly funky synth pastiche to quirkier bass music inspired pop, all given a degree of polish beyond their contemporaries. The album would later be re-released as a repackage later that year as The Perfect Red Velvet, with one of their most iconic singles \"Bad Boy\" as the title track. The album proper would be recognized as one of the greatest K-pop projects of the decade by Billboard; as we near a decade since their debut full-length, does their arguable magnum opus hold up?\n\n\n# YUKIKA - SOUL LADY\n\nstan yukika\n\n\n---\n\n##How to Complete a Rate\n\n- Use the prepared format found [HERE](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r%2FYukikaChartUpdates&amp;subject=Music%20Nerd%20Approved%20K-Pop%20Rate%20Ballot&amp;message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Pink%20Tape%0A%0ARum%20Pum%20Pum%20Pum%3A%20%0A%0AShadow%3A%20%0A%0APretty%20Girl%3A%20%0A%0AKick%3A%20%0A%0ASignal%3A%20%0A%0AStep%3A%20%0A%0AGoodbye%20Summer%3A%20%0A%0AAirplane%3A%20%0A%0AToy%3A%20%0A%0ANo%20More%3A%20%0A%0ASnapshot%3A%20%0A%0AEnding%20Page%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20REBOOT%0A%0ABaby%20Don't%20Play%3A%20%0A%0ACandle%3A%20%0A%0AI%20Feel%20You%3A%20%0A%0ARewind%3A%20%0A%0ALoved%3A%20%0A%0AJohn%20Doe%3A%20%0A%0AOne%20Black%20Night%3A%20%0A%0ABack%3A%20%0A%0AOPPA%3A%20%0A%0AFaded%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AGONE%3A%20%0A%0ARemember%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Max%20%26%20Match%0A%0AADD%3A%20%0A%0ASweet%20Crazy%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AUncover%3A%20%0A%0AGirl%20Front%3A%20%0A%0ALOONATIC%3A%20%0A%0AChaotic%3A%20%0A%0AStarlight%3A%20%0A%0AODD%20Front%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20The%20Perfect%20Red%20Velvet%0A%0ABad%20Boy%3A%20%0A%0AAll%20Right%3A%20%0A%0APeek-A-Boo%3A%20%0A%0ALook%3A%20%0A%0AI%20Just%3A%20%0A%0AKingdom%20Come%3A%20%0A%0ATime%20to%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AMy%20Second%20Date%3A%20%0A%0AAttaboy%3A%20%0A%0APerfect%2010%3A%20%0A%0AAbout%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AMoonlight%20Melody%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20%20SOUL%20LADY%0A%0AFrom%20HND%20to%20GMP%3A%20%0A%0AI%20FEEL%20LOVE%3A%20%0A%0ASOUL%20LADY%3A%20%0A%0ANEON%3A%20%0A%0AYesterday%3A%20%0A%0AA%20Day%20For%20Love%3A%20%0A%0Apit-a-pet%3A%20%0A%0ACherries%20Jubiles%3A%20%0A%0AI%20Need%20A%20Friend%3A%20%0A%0ASHADE%3A%20%0A%0AAll%20flights%20are%20delayed%3A%20%0A%0ANEON%201989%3A%20%0A%0AEND) to fill in and send your scores.

I am joined by my beloved cohosts /u/JIRACHI &amp; /u/Stryxen to make this a rate you will never forget. \n\nFeaturing 3 of the biggest stars of the 80s making their transition to the early 90s with bold and sexually charged statements that led to varying degrees of pushback. Madonna being no stranger to controversy courted her biggest backlash so far during this era, Janet, who had spent most of the 80s stepping outside of her family’s shadow to show she was a star in her own right continued her hot streak of hits while embracing further genre experimentation and exploration, and Sade locking in to make a genre-, decade-, and star-defining statement that defied their polished public reputation… and then falling asleep for the rest of the decade.\n\n## Quick links/tldr\n\n[Submission link](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=FlavaSavaVandal&amp;subject=90s%20Sensual%20Songstresses%20Rate&amp;message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Erotica%0A%0AErotica%3A%20%0A%0AFever%3A%20%0A%0ABye%20Bye%20Baby%3A%20%0A%0ADeeper%20and%20Deeper%3A%20%0A%0AWhere%20Life%20Begins%3A%20%0A%0ABad%20Girl%3A%20%0A%0AWaiting%3A%20%0A%0AThief%20of%20Hearts%3A%20%0A%0AWords%3A%20%0A%0ARain%3A%20%0A%0AWhy%20It's%20So%20Hard%3A%20%0A%0AIn%20This%20Life%3A%20%0A%0ADid%20You%20Do%20It%3F%3A%20%0A%0ASecret%20Garden%3A%20%0A%0AJustify%20My%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20janet.%0A%0AThat's%20The%20Way%20Love%20Goes%3A%20%0A%0AYou%20Want%20This%3A%20%0A%0AIf%3A%20%0A%0AThis%20Time%3A%20%0A%0AThrob%3A%20%0A%0AWhat'll%20I%20Do%3A%20%0A%0AFunky%20Big%20Band%3A%20%0A%0ANew%20Agenda%3A%20%0A%0ABecause%20Of%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AAgain%3A%20%0A%0AWhere%20Are%20You%20Now%3A%20%0A%0AThe%20Body%20That%20Loves%20You%3A%20%0A%0AAny%20Time%2C%20Any%20Place%3A%20%0A%0AAre%20You%20Still%20Up%3A%20%0A%0AWhoops%20Now%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Love%20Deluxe%0A%0ANo%20Ordinary%20Love%3A%20%0A%0AFeel%20No%20Pain%3A%20%0A%0AI%20Couldn't%20Love%20You%20More%3A%20%0A%0ALike%20a%20Tattoo%3A%20%0A%0AKiss%20of%20Life%3A%20%0A%0ACherish%20the%20Day%3A%20%0A%0APearls%3A%20%0A%0ABullet%20Proof%20Soul%3A%20%0A%0AMermaid%3A%20%0A%0ABONUS%20TRACKS%0A%0AMorning%3A%20%0A%0AYou%20Know%3A%20%0A%0ABe%20A%20Good%20Boy%3A%20%0A%0ABack%3A%20%0A%0AGo%20On%20Miss%20Janet%3A%20%0A%0AThe%20Lounge%3A%20%0A%0ARacism%3A%20%0A%0ALove%20Part%202%3A%20%0A%0AWind%3A%20%0A%0AAnother%20Lover%3A%20%0A%0AHold%20On%20Baby%3A%20%0A%0ARain%3A%20%0A%0ASweet%20Dreams%3A%20%0A%0AEND)\n\n[Backup ballot template](https://pastebin.com/eQWT0HcH)\n\nDue Date: Tentatively 9th November\n\nReveal Weekend: Tentatively 14-16th November\n\n[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3E2OdxLo1AzuW6LROkdlvw) | [Apple](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/90s-sensual-songstresses-rate/pl.u-b3b81PgU0EK5mo) | [Tidal](https://tidal.com/playlist/b555ed88-e307-498b-867d-2c45ac4493b9) | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2v649r5f8TxKYU-6bMs4IXIe8iJLseWa)\n\n# Madonna - *Erotica* (1992)\n\n*“There’s a certain satisfaction, in a little bit of pain”*\n\nMadonna is no stranger to being expressive in her artistry in spite of all public backlash: Pepsi pulling its sponsorship with the superstar over “Like a Prayer”; multiple religious groups protesting against the airing of the same video; MTV banning the video for “Justify My Love”... However, in 1992, almost three years after her last album “Like A Prayer”, Madonna was about to release one of, if not her riskiest ventures in her career ever, one that is so important that it is still referenced and talked about to this day, at least by the gays.\n\nReleased on October 20, “Erotica” is Madonna’s fifth studio album and it marked a huge departure from her past dancefloor diva persona, instead introducing the world to a more melancholic, vulnerable and sensual (shocking, i know) side to the singer. Accompanying its release is “Sex”, Madonna’s first ever book publication consisting of explicit and erotic images of the singer engaging in different sexual activities. Altogether they form a head-to-toe conceptual output, one where Madonna’s innermost thoughts and fantasies were being explored through art.\n\n“Erotica” is as 90’s urban as it can get- one of those albums where you could hear New York City just from the songs alone. The album is an amalgamation of dance pop, r&amp;b and hip hop, with hints of jazz and house influences sprinkled into it, which when all combined creates music to dance to, to fuck to and to think (MESSAGE!) to, or all at once if you’re just strong like that. As the title suggests, “Erotica” is in its core, erotic AF. In the album, Madonna finds comfort in both physical and emotional intimacy, drawing connections between feelings of pleasure &amp; pain. This central idea is furthered explored from lyrical themes as straightforward as sexual innuendos and BDSM in songs like the title track, “Secret Garden” and “Where Life Begins”, to deeper, more thought-provoking nuances such as interpersonal relationships and queerness in songs like “Bad Girl”, “Why Is It So Hard” and “In This Life”. Here lies the beauty within the record: just like in real life, it will never JUST be about the sex. It is about people, about heart, and about pain; You don’t get turned on by pure physical attraction, you’re eroticized by the feelings. From slow soulful jams with vulnerable, almost spoken word like lyrical deliveries, to hard hitting dance tracks that make your heart race and your feets break, “Erotica” is a musical reenactment of sex itself: hot and cold, rough and soft, sweet and sour. \n\nIt is also incredibly worthy to mention that both “Erotica” and “Sex” were released at the peak of the HIV/AIDS crisis, where sexual liberation, especially that linked with queerness, was an extremely sensitive subject that most people would rather avoid talking about, or worse, frown upon. Madonna’s unafraidness to reference such themes in her music not only paved the way for female openness and expression in the future, it had also raised awareness for the LGBTQ+ community and brought necessary discourse within the general public. \n\nCommercially, “Erotica” peaked at #2 on the Billboard Albums Chart, alongside spawning two top ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100 with the title track and “Deeper &amp; Deeper”. When compared to her previous efforts, although “Erotica” is considered an underperformance for the megastar, which mainly is due to the overwhelming backlash from the “Sex” book, “Erotica” has 100% stood the test of time, with many regarding it as her best work to date. \n\nWritten by JIRACHI\n\n**Songlist:**\n\n1.

Following 3 commercial success ‘80s smooth pop records, Sade hit the ‘90s sprinting with 1992’s *Love Deluxe*, a downtempo, mature and intimate, classy party stand-out in a very consistent discography, and a departure from the aesthetics and concepts of the other albums in this rate. What *Love Deluxe’s* character omits in Scandal and Celebrity, it more than makes up for in Heart and Truth Bombs, and there’s still plenty of nudity and sensuality to earn its spot in this lineup. Sade is THE QUEEN OF WOKENESS with a MESSAGE!... discussing poverty, racism, war, and love, sex, and empowerment, with the elusive Sade Adu quietly but consistently being a woke progressive queer ally; last year, she released a soundtrack song [“Young Lion”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFMmnMjFiPk), a supportive tribute to her transgender son.\n\nWhile Sade’s legacy has aged as luxuriously as their music and ascended to classic status, the band’s soulful and spotless sound, perhaps too ahead of its time, was more regarded as an inoffensive background record for a middle class dinner party than the cool enigmatic sensual icon depicted on the album cover. Thankfully new generations of listeners have rediscovered this album with a rapturous reverence, even making deep cuts into honest hits: “Like a Tattoo” has rightfully become the album’s most streamed track, only behind other Tiktok hit “Smooth Operator” in the band’s full discography. “Like a Tattoo” is the best example of this smooth soul r&amp;b sound but its grave confessive story-telling, alongside similar tracks “Pearls” and “Feel No Pain”, lets Sade’s liquid vocals and polished r&amp;b come alive with a sharp edge that cuts to the emotional core of every song. The trip hop sleeper hit “Kiss of Life (There Must Have Been An Angel By My Side)” and the lead single “No Ordinary Love” with its chugging almost-metal guitars are innovative, reinvent the band’s signature sound with alternative genres, while “Bullet Proof Soul” and “Cherish The Day” bring elegant melodies and pertinent songwriting that make even the Sophisti-est jazz songs dynamic and full.\n\nAll that said, I do think your first *Love Deluxe* listen over a middle class dinner party would be quite divine and it is indeed RECOMMENDED LISTENING for the rate. Acceptable alternatives: bubble bath; moonlight rooftop; jazz lounge; a really fancy elevator.\n\nWritten by Stryxen\n\n**Songlist:**\n\n1.

(the album) is the album where Janet (the person) learned to fuck. Before this in the 80s, Janet Jackson’s output generally shied away from the topic of s.e.x. in favour of new-jack-swing dance bops covering a range of topics personal autonomy, and race + gender relations, and love. One of her earliest big hits, *Let’s Wait Awhile* was ostensibly about not having s.e.x. in favour of being abstinent, at least for a while, in a way that feels weirdly prescient of what was to come for Janet’s 90’s output\n\nSo fast forward to 1993, it has been a few years since the absolutely massive Rhythm Nation 1814 era had run its course. And she was among the biggest names in music while still only being 2* albums into her music career. In between that album and janet. Janet’s contract with A&amp;M had run its course and a huge bidding war started for her name, eventually Virgin (yes really) won the bid and Janet and her two primary collaborators, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis would begin work on janet. \n\njanet. is an intimate album. Dropping her last name in the title of the album to show that this album is about her, completely removed from the Jackson entertainment industrial-complex. It’s a bold statement that follows in the footsteps of themes shown on Control and Rhythm Nation 1814, but combined with soft gentle touch of some of her more intimate singles like Come Back To Me from the latter album. Singles like *That’s the Way Love Goes* and *Any Time, Any Place* introduced us to this new side of Janet that was as new to us as it was to her. While also exploring a more sensual side to herself, the sonic diversity showed on Rhythm Nation 1814 was still present, while new jack swing has been pushed to the sidelines in favour of a more traditional R&amp;B structure, hip-hop is now fully incorporated into the soundscape with it showing up on the production of the lead single, while Chuck D of Public Enemy shows up on *New Agenda*. House music makes a brief cameo on radio-only single *Throb* which would be a precursor to The Velvet Rope’s *Free Xone* (also known as the best song ever to anyone who’s heard it). There’s even an industrial -dance swerve on the second single *If* which was a hit but should’ve been a much bigger fucking hit for how good it is. \n\nJanet. would go on to deliver Janet Jackson with two more number one singles in America, the lead single *That’s The Way Love Goes* becoming one of her biggest hits ever, and the ballad *Again* which is tied to the film Poetic Justice starring Janet herself and Tupac Shakur. The album produced four other top 10 singles in America and has gone on to be Janet Jackson’s best-selling album worldwide, and hopefully that can translate into a rate win. \n\nNow that’s MESSAGE!\n\nWritten by Flava\n\n**Songlist:** *\n\n1.

    "content": "So every era and decade of pop music obviously has it's trends. There are obvious big overlaps in sound and aesthetic and we usually see a lot of artists adapting to those new trends and it's usually hard to miss. \n\nBut sometimes there are examples of several artists moving in a similar artistic direction at the same time or dealing with the same themes in their songs without it being a big trend. For example, a couple of years ago I noticed a lot of artists were singing about Wabi-sabi. Also about Kintsugi. There were also a lot of songs talking about \"the cracks letting the light in\". I cant't remember all of specific references but it was some bigger names and some up and coming artists. Almost like a lot of people were going through similar things.\n\nThis summer I noticed a lot of pop musicians using fake newspaper clippings for promo. For example Marina for Princess of Power and Allie X for her new project (also Lady Gaga in her \"for your consideration\" box for Grammys). \n\nAre there any similar cases you know of? Where different artists had similar ideas or were singing about same things and themes? Or maybe some weird marketing trends that a couple of artists used but not a lot of people noticed?",

While I’m waiting\r\nfor tour dates to be announced, I started thinking about how to get tickets for big-name tours in\r\ngeneral. Every time I try for big shows, I end up in the virtual queue for an hour only to see\r\n“platinum” or resale listings pop up before I even get through.\n\r\nI’m fine paying face value, it just feels like it’s impossible to get decent seats anymore unless\r\nyou have some kind of presale magic. I’ve never really tried to get presale tickets, it seems\r\ncomplicated. But with rumors about this tour, I want to up my game.\n\r\nIf you’ve managed to score good seats for major arena shows, HOW did you do it?\n\r\nWhat insider tricks should I know before the next wave of tour announcements drops?\n\r\nLast time I gave up and watched TikToks from the nosebleeds.\n\r\nI don’t want to do that again!

If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1oc0vdk/the_popheads_charts_october_20th_2025_fancy_some/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

    "content": "I feel like there is a lot of discussion on this subreddit about songwriting and production credits, but I feel like we very rarely talk about pop artists who are genuinely talented instrumentalists and can compose nice tracks. Or, people who could sit down with an instrument and play it in the studio for their own and for other people's records. Or artists who play instruments outside of their own live performances and are in bands for other artists or play gigs for other artists.\n\nOn the top of my head I can think of these pop and pop adjacent artists:\n\n1. Billie Eilish: Played keyboards and synths on her last album\n\n2. Natalie Mering aka Weyes Blood: She played the guitar and piano on In The Darkness, Hearts Aglow.\n\n3. Haim: Danielle and Alana play the guitar on all Haim records, Alana does the keys on all of them, and Este does the Bass and they all play drums on their records.\n\n4. St. Vincent: She's otherworldly, she played almost everything but strings and wind instruments on her first two albums, and she plays the guitars and synths on her newer albums.\n\n5. Bruno Mars: He played the guitars and other plucked instruments on An Evening with Silk Sonic\n\n6. Laufey: She plays Cello and Piano on her records.",

However,there are albums that came close if it wasn’t for that one song that doesn’t compare to the other ones. I sill say Thank U Next is a perfect album without “Make up”, that just don’t compare but it’s still my favorite Ariana album.\n\nWhat about you? What are some songs that would be perfect if not for that one or few songs?",

    "title": "15 years ago, Taylor Swift released Speak Now",
    "content": "On October 25, 2010, Taylor Swift released her album [Speak Now](https://imgur.com/a/5nzoisQ ). The album was Swift’s third album and her follow up to her mega successful album Fearless. Swift wrote the album by herself (with the exception of If This Was A Movie). The album mostly about heartbreak and reflections on broken relationships, and some tracks were inspired by Swift’s rising stardom in the public eye to address her critics and adversaries. \n\n5 singles were released from the standard version of the album and six overall (one single is from the deluxe edition of the album). [Mine](https://youtu.be/XPBwXKgDTdE) was the first single from the album and would become the album’s biggest hit peaking at #3 on the Hot 100 and #2 on the Hot Country Songs chart. The second single [Back to December](https://youtu.be/QUwxKWT6m7U) would peak at #6 on the Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot Country Songs charts. The third single [Mean](https://youtu.be/jYa1eI1hpDE) would peak at #11 on the Hot 100 and #2 on the Hot Country Songs charts. [The Story of Us](https://youtu.be/nN6VR92V70M) would peak at #41 on the Hot 100.

    "content": "With the new release of Demi Lovato, I’ve been thinking about how there’s a big difference between artists who experiment because they want to vs artists who experiment because they don’t know what to stick with yet.\n\nSome artists change their sound or genre every album, but it always feels intentional — like they’re just having fun or exploring new ideas. Some clear examples this are Madonna, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift. Each era sounds different, but it still feels like them. You can tell they’re confident in the chaos.\n\nThen there are artists who also switch it up a lot, but it feels more like they’re searching for something that clicks. It’s not necessarily a bad thing — but you can kinda tell when someone isn't really confident with their sound yet. They’re trying pop one album, alt the next, maybe a dance single after that, and it just doesn’t connect in the same way. That is exactly how I personally with Demi. I do listen to Demi a lot but I also do feel like she doesn't really know what to do and tries to somehow follow the current trend with each of her albums. Her run from Teen-Rock to Pop to EDM to R&amp;B to Hard Rock to Dance doesn't feel smooth to me.\n\nIt’s interesting because on the surface both types of artists are “experimenting,” but the intention behind it feels totally different. One is curiosity and growth, the other is uncertainty and trial-and-error.\n\nWhat are some examples of artists you think like trying new stuff vs artists who are still figuring out who they are sonically?",

    "content": "A little game inspired by some cute and compelling-in-hindsight reviews I've been reading recently—post as a top-level comment a review or article quote about an artist **made 10 years ago or earlier,** and we'll all see if we can guess to whom it refers.\n\nI will start us off with three different artists whose names I'm sure everyone here knows...\n\n&gt;*The music industry’s collapse may have seemed like a dress rehearsal for the current financial meltdown, but there are still stars in the business, and there is an interesting trend in both number and gender: the popular groups are male—Nickelback, Coldplay, the Eagles. The solo stars now, though, are more likely to be women: Alicia Keys, Carrie Underwood, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and* ***\\[Artist A\\]*** *(who probably won’t need that surname for long). Her self-titled début album, released when she was sixteen, has been on the charts for two years. It is triple platinum and still rests, impressively, at No. 31 on the Billboard 200. \\[She\\] wrote or co-wrote every song on the album, one when she was twelve. ...\\[Artist A\\] is not an agent of revolution; she, much like Beyoncé, is a preternaturally skilled student of established values. Her precociousness isn’t about her chart success, but lies in the quality of her work, how fully she’s absorbed the lessons of her elders and how little she seems to care which radio format will eventually claim her. Change the beat and the instruments around the voice, and her songs could work anywhere.*\n\n—From an article on Artist A's rise by Sasha Frere-Jones for the New Yorker\n\n&gt;*The teenage heartthrob who cut through the fourth-quarter clutter with the pop/R&amp;B single \\[\"Lead Single\"\\] delivers her debut album, a top 40-ready workout filled with hook-laden songs from the same bag as the title cut. Blessed with a sweet voice and a wholesome, girl-next-door image,* ***\\[Artist B\\]*** *has hit a nerve among a teen fan base primed by the likes of Hanson, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys... Although much of the world will be introduced to \\[Artist B\\] by this album, she already tasted the limelight in a two-year run on \\[television show\\]. A talent to watch.*\n\n—Billboard review of Artist B's debut album\n\n&gt;*I actually enjoy a good portion of this album. It's a bubblegum pop record that includes some infectious music that make you want to sing along to at high volumes. Some of the material is just throwaway junk but not too many albums don't include crappy filler. The title track is one of the good ones along with the monster single \\[\"Lead Single\"\\] and one of my favorite songs this year \\[\"Second Single\"\\]. If* ***\\[Artist C\\]*** *can continue to write music like these tracks she will have nice little career ahead of her.*\n\n&gt;*She will probably never achieve the hysteria of \\[\"Lead Single\"\\] but she's not going to be a Toni Basil. She's got at minimum five hit singles on this platter and a couple of them have staying power long past their run on pop radio. I would compare this album to Pink's excellent M!ssundaztood or Ashlee Simpson's Autobiography. Not groundbreaking but fun and infectious the way music needs to be sometimes.*\n\n—RateYourMusic review of Artist C's debut major-label album\n\nSee if you can guess the artists above, and post your own redacted quotes below so I can guess yours \\^\\_\\_\\^",

    "content": "Welcome back to the Popheads Jukebox! Here are [the results from last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1o2j7tz/the_popheads_jukebox_revival_week_327_where_is_my/):\n\n* RAYE - WHERE IS MY HUSBAND!: 9.39\n* Madison Beer - yes baby: 7.64\n* XG - GALA: 7.64\n* Miley Cyrus - Secrets (feat. Lindsey Buckingham &amp; Mick Fleetwood): 7.17\n* Allie X - Is Anybody Out There?: 5.25\n\n-\n\n* Adele - Hello: 8.17\n\n\n###Rules Refresher\n\n1. Rate the songs a score from 1 to 10. Please keep it to one decimal place at the most (so 7.5 is fine but 7.58 is not). Also don’t get too hung up on the final scores. This is a fun exercise and not a competition so don’t worry about over/under rating things. Just give what you think the song is to you.\n\n2. For your review, reply to the comment that will be posted by one of us for each song. Avoid posting your reviews as a top level comment cause we probably won’t notice them if you do. Non-reviews such as questions or general commentary as upper level comments are fine.\n\n3. Must have some sort of justification. Try to be a bit more concise than “It’s a bop!” or “I don’t like it”. Explain why! It doesn’t have to be long, two or three sentences can be plenty (though more is definitely allowed). We reserve the right not to include a review in the final total if proper justification is not given.\n\n4. You don’t have to review each song to participate! You can do all of them or only the ones you’re familiar with.\n\n5. The thread will be open for 13 days and close in two Wednesdays around 11PM EST. The scores will be calculated and a new post will come up the next day (Thursday) at 5PM EST(ish) with the next week’s tracks.\n\n---\n\n###This Week’s Tracks\n\n* **[Khalid - out of body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrXXgp8XP1E)**\n* **[Magdalena Bay - Second Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAe2faaZ3sY)**\n* **[Taylor Swift - The Fate of Ophelia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko70cExuzZM)**\n* **[Victoria Justice - Love Zombie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-S91K81NRk)**\n* **[Zara Larsson - Midnight Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvY8fdgezLQ)**\n\nThrowback\n\n* **[Justin Bieber - Sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRh_vgS2dFE)**\n\n\n—\n\n\n###Next Week\n\n* Doja Cat - Gorgeous\n* Kim Petras - I Like Ur Look\n* Oklou - viscus (feat.

    "title": "Anyone remembers Birdy and Gabrielle Aplin?",
    "content": "I remember back in the first half of the 2010s there was a small but still influential trend of pop ballads leaning towards melodic folk, with artists like Birdy, Gabrielle Aplin, Tom Odell, James Bay, George Ezra, Kodaline, Aurora, Daughter, and Lauren Aquilina. Quite a good number of artists, most of them from the UK (for some reason, British singers always seem more romantic than American ones). The ones that stood out the most for me were the first two: Birdy and Gabrielle Aplin. Both were very young when they became famous. They were pretty much the epitome of the English roses that history and literature books talk about.\n\nI was very young back then too, still a teenager, and when I found out about them, I immediately fell in love with their music. I was still an emo kid, listening to post-hardcore bands like Bring Me the Horizon and Sleeping with Sirens, but when I felt sad and alone, I would open YouTube and tune into their melodic, introspective songs. They always made me feel better. It was my dream back then to attend one of their concerts, to travel to England, and enjoy the English rain. It never happened. Years passed, I became more depressed, and all the big dreams I had -- becoming a poet, a novelist, a musician -- went nowhere. Then the pandemic came and made everything worse. I dropped out of college twice but finally got a degree, and suddenly it was already 2025, and I was 30. For some reason, this autumn -- with its early darkness and distant, fading sun -- made me think of them again. They were around my age, but after their first two albums, it seems like they either stopped making music or never found the same success.\n\nSo, what happened to them? Are there any new musicians in this decade who resemble their sound, that pop, indie-folk magic that mesmerized us with sweet, melodic vocals and that unmistakable British accent that felt straight out of a Jane Austen novel? Is it possible that I could finally become a musician and honor them, releasing an indie folk album that would become a big success? And in some future interview, I would mention them as my main influences, and thank them for making music more poetic, intimate and sincere?",

I can only assume this is because less people are going out to clubs, malls, partys, third spaces as they use too.. so is this the new normal for pop?",

I could see some parallels with pop music and religion: \n\n1) people have unrealistic expectations of their pop girlies to be politically responsible and woke even though humans are not perfect (like the uplifted, pedestaled pastor who gets caught cheating).\n\n2) When you do hear the right song that hits you right, it feels euphoric and you can’t stop playing it over and over (my most recent ones are By the End of the Night by Amber Mark, The Subway, twilight zone, Shapeshifting on a Saturday Night). It almost feels spiritual to have the melodies or lyrics or tone of a voice hit u in that right way. \n\n3) when you sing in a crowd at a concert, it feels akin to a worship night at church. You feel like a part of something bigger and it’s awesome. \n\nWhat are some other ways pop music parallels religion?",

According to a statement, the album “traces a widescreen emotional arc of feminine mystique, transformation, and transcendence — moving between intimacy and operatic scale to create a radiant world where sound, language, and culture fuse as one.”\n\nWhile it’s unclear which songs will feature guests, the press release confirms that the record will include Björk, Portuguese fado singer Carminho, Spanish flamenco star Estrella Morente, Spanish singer Silvia Pérez Cruz, música mexicana star Yahritza, and experimental musician Yves Tumor. The boys choir Escolania de Montserrat i Cor Cambra Palau de la Música Catalana will also be part of the album.\n\nThe album is broken up into four movements, and the physical versions of the LP will include 18 songs while digital versions will include 15. Among the physical exclusives are “Focu ‘Ranni” and “Jeanne” from MOV III, and “Novia Robot” from MOV IV. The album also includes songs titled “Porcelana,” “Mio Cristo,””Memória,” and “La Perla.”",

This week, we have the chart of /u/pm174!\n\nRank|Song|Their Points|Actual Rank|Total Points\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n1|Charli xcx - Girl, so confusing featuring lorde|15.0|#154|143.5\n2|Caroline Polachek - Pang|14.0|#387|58.5\n3|Caroline Polachek - So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings|12.5|#400|56.0\n3|The Japanese House - Touching Yourself|12.5|#571|40.5\n5|Taylor Swift - Fortnight (feat. Post Malone)|10.5|#1458|18.5\n5|Troye Sivan - One Of Your Girls|10.5|#770|31.0\n7|Caroline Polachek - Welcome To My Island|7.0|#559|41.0\n7|Sabrina Carpenter - Tears|7.0|#30|523.5\n7|Taylor Swift - So Long, London|7.0|#1011|25.0\n7|The 1975 - Robbers|7.0|#622|37.0\n7|The Japanese House - Something Has To Change|7.0|#2379|14.5\n\nIf you’d like to have your top 10 shown in a future installment, *PLEASE USE [THIS GOOGLE FORM](https://forms.gle/Mpz5yQXzLyMHJsLJ8)*! Also, if you sign up for this **PLEASE also sign up for the actual charts, with the form found below**. \n\n---\n\n[Here's the current list of people signed up for the charts!](https://pastebin.com/utvJZ08B)  \n\n#If you'd like to sign up for the charts, **[you can sign up here](https://forms.gle/es672tr8jzNwp4Qh6)**!\n \nThe tracking dates for the next weekly chart is **October 16, 12:00 PM GMT - October 23, 11:59 AM GMT** and results will come out next Monday, October 27.\n\n---\n\n##How The Chart Works:\n\nThese charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1o624hp/the_popheads_charts_october_13th_2025_will/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

    "content": "Partially inspired by the rise of Showgirls material I've seen with conjunction of the new Taylor record, it had me thinking what is the best \"so bad it's good\" music/albums of pop music. Something that swung hard only to completely hit another mark. Taylor's Life of a Showgirl feels to predictable to fall into this, but her album Rep has the argument on being in that musical equivalent of camp classic, especially with the whole \"goth punk female range bs\". Are their pop equivalents to these campy bad movies, or does that bad its good mentality not translate over to albums",

    "title": "How much do famous artists ACTUALLY make? Can we get real numbers?",
    "content": "I’m so confused about how much famous artists actually make and I’m hoping someone can break down the real numbers. On one hand, you scroll through Instagram and these musicians are flashing massive watch collections, luxury cars, designer everything, the lifestyle screams money. But then I hear people saying that most artists are actually broke, that they’re just fronting for image, or that the labels take everything and they’re barely scraping by despite millions of streams. So what’s the truth? How much does someone with 10 million monthly Spotify listeners actually take home? Is touring where the real money is? Are these luxury lifestyles even real or is it all rented and borrowed? I keep hearing everything from “streaming pays pennies” to “top artists make $50M+ a year” but nobody ever backs it up with actual data. Does anyone actually have insight into what moderately famous musicians (not Taylor Swift level, but like recognized artists) are really earning?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

    "content": "Now that it's been a year since most of the major albums of 2024, which are you still listening to?\n\nI tend to move very swiftly forwards through music, looping a new song every few days and keeping up with weekly album releases, so I haven't had a lot of albums from last year on what one might call \"regular rotation.\" With that said, I have re-listened to some in full, and a few songs made it onto various playlists and came up on autoplay enough for me to sift through my listening metrics out of curiosity.\n\nMy personal most-played 2024 releases in 2025 (not including, e.g., singles for 2025 albums or 2024 albums I heard *for the first time* in 2025):\n\n* ***BRAT*** simply has a lot to offer, so I keep switching my favorite tracks off the record and looping new ones. I didn't understand the \"Everything is romantic\" hype until this year, but now I adore both versions!\n* ***C,XOXO*** has been my surprise recommendation to a *lot* of people; I keep telling people to listen to it using my tracklist order and then just sitting down and doing the same myself. I prefer to listen to the whole thing together as one journey, so it doesn't happen too often, but I have made a lot of time for this album just for how it makes me feel.\n* ***Radical Optimism*** was simply confusing to me on first listen given the promotion and description, but now that I've returned to it, I find it really pleasant and a lovely summer listen! Shout out to everyone who was saying this on release day in the thread; I needed some time to come to the same conclusion.\n* ***Big Ideas*** is similarly summerful; I started itching to play a couple of songs in April and finally got the chance to put it on all the way through around a fire pit over drinks in July. This might become a yearly tradition; it's just so satisfying.\n* ***The Great Impersonator*** has a lot of songs that work for this nostalgic 2000s acoustic phase I've been in this year; it's very pleasant to listen to when I need to slow down and stop dancing. Alternatively, sometimes you just need to cry very hard.\n\n**What are you still listening to?** And if you're listening to too many 2024 albums to count, or just have a different listening style than me (which is most people!), **what has revealed new depths to you over the past year? What do you think will continue to age well and be meaningful to you?**",

Addison Rae, Miley Cyrus, Lorde, Sabrina, neither of them really dominated the conversation although they each had their moments. I’d say that this year was mostly centered around Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift but I’d love to read your opinions !",

The reason being is that I’m no longer in that space I was when the album came out because when was released I just got out of the toxic decade of friendship and I can relate to most of the songs like such as I wish I hated you bye and don’t wanna break up again,but now I can’t really play those songs cause I’m no longer in that headspace. I will say I can play the songs, but it doesn’t hit the same if that makes sense. What about you? \n\nAre there any albums that you can’t really play because you’re no longer sad or happy or whatever reason?",

    "content": "Love and romance is obviously a common subject in pop (perhaps...the most common? A discussion point in itself) but what do we thing is the most referenced stage in relationships? \n\nThe breakup song is obviously a phenomenon in itself -  countless artists have written about the immediate aftermath. Usually this takes the form of wanting someone back, asking what went wrong, or a sassy kiss-off that their ex was never what they wanted anyway. (Consider Hello by Adele, All Too Well by Taylor, or Manchild by Sabrina). \n\nThere's also your classic falling-in-love or I'm-so-lucky song - Ordinary by Alex Warren, Audrey Hepburn by Maisie Peters, countless Ed Sheeran wedding songs. Or the \"what are we??\" song, like Casual by Chappell Roan, or Call Me Maybe by CRJ. Or the \"apologies for what happened\" song, like Back to December by Taylor or Sorry by Justin Bieber. \n\nPersonally I love a \"the relationship is over but we haven't called it quits yet\" song - think Hard Feelings by Lorde or You're Losing Me by Taylor. \n\nSo - what's your favourite part of a relationship to be explored? What are your favourite niche situations to be captured in 3.5 minutes of catchy melodies?",

Tbh i can only think of Ariana at this point.\n\nWhy there are no singers like Whitney, Celine, Beyonce etc. anymore??\n\nEDIT: If you think Sabrina is a vocalist, then you don’t understand my question…\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for all the reactions! Its interesting to see your opions. Also the fact that i think some singers are no power house vocalists (Sabrina, Dua) doesnt mean i dont like them! For me a vocalist is belting, high (and low) notes, runs and riffs, control, vibrato and agility.",

He has demonstrated the rare ability to adapt with the times (his first #1 was \"...Baby One More Time\" by Britney, which was recorded in 1998), but the question is, with which artist(s) can he collaborate to help him achieve this, and how long will it take him?",

This week, we have the chart of /u/tylerf98!\n\nRank|Song|Their Points|Actual Rank|Total Points\n---|---|---|---|---|---\n1|RAYE - WHERE IS MY HUSBAND!|14.5|#16|966.0\n1|Sammy Virji - Survive|14.5|#2139|14.5\n3|Max Dean - Gets Like That|12.5|#3302|12.5\n3|Sammy Virji - Burn The River|12.5|#3302|12.5\n5|Anyma - Girls MIA|7.5|#3515|12.0\n5|Chris Lake - LA NOCHE|7.5|#516|36.5\n5|Doja Cat - Cards|7.5|#39|387.5\n5|Doja Cat - Gorgeous|7.5|#19|787.5\n5|Madison Beer - yes baby|7.5|#46|348.0\n5|Magdalena Bay - Second Sleep|7.5|#33|441.0\n5|Rochelle Jordan - Doing It Too|7.5|#41|382.5\n5|Zara Larsson - Blue Moon|7.5|#22|645.0\n\n\nIf you’d like to have your top 10 shown in a future installment, *PLEASE USE [THIS GOOGLE FORM](https://forms.gle/Mpz5yQXzLyMHJsLJ8)*! Also, if you sign up for this **PLEASE also sign up for the actual charts, with the form found below**. \n\n---\n\n[Here's the current list of people signed up for the charts!](https://pastebin.com/utvJZ08B)  \n\n#If you'd like to sign up for the charts, **[you can sign up here](https://forms.gle/es672tr8jzNwp4Qh6)**!\n \nThe tracking dates for the next weekly chart is **October 9, 12:00 PM GMT - October 16, 11:59 AM GMT** and results will come out next Monday, October 20.\n\n---\n\n##How The Chart Works:\n\nThese charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each. \n\n---\n\n#Credits\n\n* **Reddit Post Author / Chart Runner**: /u/ImADudeDuh\n* **Video Editor:** /u/rickikardashian\n* **Statistician:** /u/RandomHypnotica\n\n[Chart Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/charts)\n\n[Last Week’s Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1o01rls/the_popheads_charts_october_6th_2025_zara_and/) \n\n[Link to an archive of all charts](https://popheads-chart-cs0o.onrender.com/) [Credit to u/bright_baby_blue for the website!]\n\n---",

It was only for 18+ initially, but Avril made it open to all by request and she played a free concert.\n\nWorst was Gene Simmons.Not Pop I know, but KISS is a popular band so I guess it counts.He's a creep and makes everybody feel uncomfortable, especially women. Won't go into details but yeah, he's notorious for this.",

    "content": "So I've listened to every Kylie Minogue album but yesterday when I was trying to listen to her song \"The One\" I accidentally stumbled across a song called [\"I Am The One For You,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYtEdrDWB7E) a house banger from the early '90s that I had no clue existed! It was apparently a B-side for the single release of [\"Shocked\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwYB-DVS27k) and it just made me think about how cool it is that I've been a dedicated fan of Kylie for years now and have actively tried to listen to as much of her music as I can, and yet I'm still finding new little songs hidden away. Her discography is so deep and she's been around for so many different release formats that there's always some B-side or remix or compilation single or something waiting out there to be discovered.\n\nThis is an experience I have specifically with Kylie, and it got me thinking... what are other unique factors that you find \"rewarding\" about being a fan of a specific artist? Obviously we're fans of artists because we like their music, but is there anything else about them that gives them that special little edge and gives you a unique experience with them, specifically?\n\nFor example, one of the benefits of being a Mariah Carey fan is that she cares a lot about honoring her past music, so she's great about releasing tasteful anniversary versions of her albums that are remastered and include new remixes and unreleased songs. Another benefit is that she takes remixes very seriously, so she has lots of remix albums/EPs that are worth listening to.\n\nWould love to hear other things people like about being fans of their faves!",
