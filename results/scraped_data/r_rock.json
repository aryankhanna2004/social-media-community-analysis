    "title": "The Helldozers Rock’n’Roll Diplomacy: How Beer, Ouzo, and Vodka Became Our Stage Ritual",
    "content": "It all started back in April 2010, when three musicians — Atha, Philipp, and Tony — got together at Atha’s house to record one song.\nWe instantly connected through the spirit of rock’n’roll — one song became two, then three, then ten… and soon our first EP and live shows followed.\n\nFunny enough, each of us came from a different background:\nAtha is Greek, Philipp is German, and Tony is Russian.\nAnd, naturally, each of us preferred our own kind of drink — but when creating music, we drank them all together.\n\nThat’s how every track we’ve written has probably been fueled by beer (Philipp, being a true German, can drink unthinkable amounts of it), ouzo (which Atha taught us to sip slowly and enjoy properly), and stronger stuff like brandy, whiskey, or vodka — Tony’s choice.\n\nOver time, this mix of national drinks turned into a ritual — a tradition that has stayed with The Helldozers ever since.\nBefore every show, we line up disposable shot cups along the edge of the stage — one filled with vodka, the next with ouzo, alternating — and invite the audience to come forward, grab a shot (without knowing which one they’ll get!) and drink it with us before we start playing.\n\nPhilipp usually jokes from the stage that our music sounds even better that way.\nAnd for 15 years now, we’ve kept that tradition alive wherever it’s technically possible — as Philipp always says:\n“Come to the stage and have a drink with us — it makes the music sound even better!” 🍻\n\nThis tradition actually became so well-known that for several years we even had an endorsement deal with a vodka brand, which provided us with a full crate for every show. 🍸\n\nAnd if you’re curious what that spirit led to, check out our new album Parasite 2025.",

This is a track from the new album ***Roar Like Thunder***, just released on major streaming platforms (see the link at the bottom of this post). Pete Frengel is a musician living in central PA, and was inspired to create the album after hearing songs drawn from traditional African American prison work songs recorded in 1947 at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman Farm). These recordings have been preserved and made publicly accessible through the Internet Archive. The source recordings themselves are traditional works firmly in the public domain: [https://archive.org/details/negroprisonsongs](https://archive.org/details/negroprisonsongs)\n\nALBUM COVER: JEFF COPUS \n\nThis project does not use or rely upon any commercial reissues, remasters, or compilations. Instead, all audio sources were taken from the publicly available archival materials which remain free for scholarly and creative use.   \n\nThe vocals heard here have been carefully restored and reinterpreted from the original field recordings. New instrumentation and arrangements were added with the intention of amplifying their voices: C. B. Cook, Dan Barnes, Benny Will Richardson, and Henry Jimpson-Wallace. This album, Roar Like Thunder, is offered in the spirit of cultural preservation, education, and respect for the incarcerated people whose music survived against the odds. \n\nTen percent of proceeds will be donated to the Association for Cultural Equity (ACE) (founded by Alan Lomax) to support preservation of world music traditions: [https://www.culturalequity.org/](https://www.culturalequity.org/)\n\nAnother ten percent to the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) (founded by Bryan Stevenson), which works to end mass incarceration and racial injustice: [https://eji.org/](https://eji.org/)\n\n[GET THE MUSIC](https://petefrengel.hearnow.com/)",

The ultimate test of your fear and determination. The ultimate struggle. The ultimate sacrifice.\nIt makes the issues we’re concerned with today seem minor and unimportant when nations oppose each other. At the end of the next section from Wikipedia, it says that his father reversed his position, and took the risk and joined the war effort because he saw the evilness of the Nazis that had to be stopped at all costs.\n\n“The song sets up the story premise for The Wall movie, set over footage recreating the British contribution to Operation Shingle, where American and British troops landed on the beaches near Anzio, Italy, with the goal of liberating Rome from German control. These forces included Z Company of the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, in which Waters' father Eric served.[5] As Waters tells it, the forward commander had asked to withdraw his forces from a German Tiger I tank assault, but the generals refused, and \"the generals gave thanks / As the other ranks / Held back the enemy tanks for a while\" and \"the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price / Of a few hundred ordinary lives\" as the German assault inflicted heavy losses including Eric Waters.\nIn the second verse of the song (which makes up the reprise later in The Wall film), Waters describes how he found a letter of condolence from the British government, described as a note from George VI in the form of a gold leaf scroll which \"His Majesty signed / with his own rubber stamp.\" Waters' resentment then explodes in the final line \"And that's how the High Command took my daddy from me.\"\nThe underlying theme of the song is one of the primary catalysts for the character Pink's descent into isolation throughout the story of The Wall, especially in the film version.[6]\nOn 18 February 2014, 70 years to the day after his father was killed at Anzio,[7] Waters unveiled a memorial to the 8th Battalion, and his father, near to the site of the battle. Another monument had already been erected at the approximate spot where his father fell. After many years of not knowing the details of what happened on that fateful day, Waters was finally able to get some closure after 93-year-old Fusilier and Anzio veteran Harry Shindler uncovered precise details of the time and place of Waters' father's death. Both of them were present at the unveiling of the memorial.[8]\nWaters has indicated that his father was originally a conscientious objector during the outbreak of the Second World War. However, as the German expansion grew, Waters' father felt compelled to join the armed forces. Waters goes on to say, \"So he went back to the conscription board in London and told them he had changed his mind. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, which is how he ended up here 70 years ago. He believed he was involved in a necessary fight against the Nazis, and for that he paid the ultimate price.\"[9] (Wikipedia)",

It has been out for almost a year now, and we are slowly beginning to build a solid fanbase. The feedback we get is that we are a solid blend of Nirvana/Foos/Biffy so if you like these bands it would be great if you could check us out.\n\nWe recently updated our cover art, so let us know what you think. It was designed and drawn by my brother (who I am scared of) our drummer. \n\nWe have our first gig coming up with Scotland Rocks Radio in december so we are busy prepping for that, and we are back in the studio next weekend to finish off 6 more songs which we will be releasing as singles.\n\nI have included our Spotify link below, but we are on all other platforms if you don't use it.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/7FWj9E465vHktCqqFQZ3EO?si=SXUFGwebRnGBvMvufhq2ow\n\nKeep rocking on ya Legends 🤘🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🧨💥",

The EP opens with two darker tracks – Prisoners and Targets – inspired by the troubled times we’re living through. The second half moves toward a more melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere.\n\nIt’s both intimidating and exciting to put these first pieces out into the world, and I’d be truly grateful for any feedback – on the writing, the production, or just the overall mood.\n\nIf anyone here is based in Paris and relates to this kind of sound, I’d love to connect and maybe collaborate on future tracks.\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to listen!",

It leans heavy but isn’t afraid of space or mood; riffs can shift from melodic spacey leads to sharper alt-metal crunch, while the vocals move between ethereal, melodic passages and raw, emotive bursts. It’s meant to feel like that in-between state... not fully one genre or another, but floating somewhere on the edge of heavy and dreamlike. Would love to know what you think of this kind of mix :) [You can check it out on all streaming platforms or BandCamp.](https://www.submithub.com/link/regina-liminal-space) We are from Montevideo, Uruguay!",

I really wished that he would have either done something different with his sound throughout the years to keep it fresh, or focussed more on filmmaking because I find his filmmaking career so much more interesting and creative.\n\nObviously he’s an icon and he’s never made a bad album per se, I just think his schtick doesn’t have the staying power to warrant the same album time and time again",

They're legends for a reason. The setlist was perfect, and the band's performance was tight and atmospheric. But... the mix in our venue was just kinda muddy. Chino's vocals were buried for a good chunk of the set, and the low end was a bit overwhelming. Still a 8/10 experience because it's the 'Tones.\n\n**Chevelle:** HOLY. CRAP. I was not prepared. From the first note, the mix was absolutely pristine. Pete's voice was crystal clear, the guitar tones were crushing yet distinct, and the drums hit you right in the chest. It was one of the best-sounding live mixes I've ever heard. They played with so much raw energy and precision.\n\nIt just shocked me that a band I consider (musically) less layered and complex than Deftones delivered a far superior audio experience. Anyone else had a similar experience with these two live?",

    "title": "A Life of Revolutionary Sound: The Journey of Jimi Hendrix",
    "content": "A Life of Revolutionary Sound: The Journey of Jimi Hendrix\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Early Life (1942-1966)\\*\\*\n\nBorn Johnny Allen Hendrix (later renamed James Marshall Hendrix) on November 27, 1942, in Seattle, Washington, Jimi's early life was marked by poverty and family instability. His connection to music began with a ukulele and then a second-hand acoustic guitar. As a left-handed player, he famously restrung right-handed guitars upside down, developing a completely unique technique.\n\n\n\nHe honed his craft as a backing guitarist for touring R&amp;B acts on the \"Chitlin' Circuit,\" playing with icons like Little Richard, The Isley Brothers, and Sam Cooke. Though he was a phenomenal player, he felt stifled creatively in these roles and longed to lead his own band.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Breakthrough and Stardom (1966-1969)\\*\\*\n\nIn 1966, Hendrix moved to New York's Greenwich Village, where he formed Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. It was here that former Animals bassist Chas Chandler discovered him and brought him to London, promising to make him a star.\n\n\n\nChandler became his manager, and Hendrix formed \\*\\*The Jimi Hendrix Experience\\*\\* with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding. The UK music scene was instantly electrified. His raw talent, flamboyant style, and revolutionary approach to the guitar—using feedback, distortion, and wah-wah pedals as expressive tools—blew away his peers, including Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, and The Beatles.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*1967:\\*\\* The release of their first single, \"Hey Joe,\" was followed by the groundbreaking album \\*\\*\\*Are You Experienced\\*\\*\\*, which featured timeless tracks like \"Purple Haze,\" \"Foxy Lady,\" \"The Wind Cries Mary,\" and \"Fire.\"\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Monterey Pop Festival (1967):\\*\\* His incendiary performance, culminating in him setting his guitar on fire, announced him to America and became the stuff of rock and roll legend.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*1968:\\*\\* The critically acclaimed double album \\*\\*\\*Electric Ladyland\\*\\*\\*, featuring his definitive cover of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" and the epic \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return),\" became his only US number one album.\n\n\n\nHendrix was the embodiment of the 1960s counterculture. His performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Woodstock in 1969 was a defining moment—a distorted, psychedelic, and poignant commentary on the state of America during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Final Days and Internal Struggles\\*\\*\n\nBy 1970, The Jimi Hendrix Experience had disbanded. Hendrix was exhausted from a relentless touring schedule, embroiled in complex business disputes, and under pressure from record labels to produce more music. He was experimenting musically, forming a new band called Band of Gypsys with bassist Billy Cox and drummer Buddy Miles, exploring funkier, blues-rooted sounds. Despite his iconic status, he felt immense pressure and was searching for a new musical direction.\n\n\n\n\\### The Mysterious Circumstances of His Death\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Final Night: September 17-18, 1970\\*\\*\n\nAfter a late-night recording session in London, Hendrix spent the early hours of September 18 at a party at the flat of a German model named Monika Dannemann. Sometime around 7 a.m., Dannemann found him unconscious in her bed, unresponsive. She called an ambulance, but Hendrix was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Mary Abbot's Hospital in Kensington at 9:45 a.m.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Cause\\*\\*\n\nThe official inquest ruled his death as \\*\\*asphyxiation due to inhalation of vomit after barbiturate intoxication.\\*\\* He had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping pills, which was nearly double the recommended dose. The coroner recorded an open verdict, meaning there was insufficient evidence to prove whether it was an accident or intentional.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Enduring Mystery and Controversy\\*\\*\n\nThe exact events of that night have been the subject of intense speculation and conflicting accounts for decades.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Monika Dannemann's Story:\\*\\* She claimed that Hendrix took the pills unknowingly, thinking they were her prescribed medication for nerves. She stated she was asleep when it happened and that he had been alive and talking when she called the ambulance.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Conflicting Accounts:\\*\\* Others, including Hendrix's manager Michael Jeffrey, who arrived on the scene, gave different versions. Some suggest Jeffrey may have had something to hide, though this is pure conjecture.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*The Ambulance Call:\\*\\* A key point of controversy is the significant delay between when Dannemann found him and when she called for help. This delay is often cited as a critical factor in his death.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Conspiracy Theories:\\*\\* Over the years, wilder theories have emerged, including suggestions of foul play or a deliberate overdose, but there is no credible evidence to support these claims.\n\n\n\nThe most widely accepted conclusion is that \\*\\*Jimi Hendrix died of a tragic accidental overdose.\\*\\* He was known to have a low tolerance for alcohol and pills, and it is likely he simply misjudged the strength of the medication he ingested.\n\n\n\n\\### Legacy\n\n\n\nJimi Hendrix's life was tragically short—he was only 27 years old, part of the infamous \"27 Club.\" Yet, in just four years as a superstar, he fundamentally changed the landscape of popular music. He expanded the vocabulary of the electric guitar more than any other player before or since.\n\n\n\nHe remains an enduring icon of creativity, innovation, and the psychedelic era—a visionary artist whose music continues to inspire and astonish new generations of listeners and musicians. His death remains a sobering reminder of the pressures of fame and the fragility of genius.",

    "content": "In the music video of November Rain, we can see the wedding and the tragic death of the fiancée, but the cause of her death is never clearly explained. I have a theory: it is likely that she died by suicide. Axl Rose was a close friend of writer Del James, who wrote the short story Without You (the inspiration for the video). In that story, the fiancée kills herself because she is unhappy in the relationship. After this, the funeral takes place, and the coffin is half-open, just like in the video. In the story, she takes her own life with a gun. Interestingly, in the video there’s a scene where Axl is walking at night and we see a gun shop, which could either be a reference to the band’s name, Guns N’ Roses, or a symbolic hint at the cause of death.",

It was pretty boring tbh. my dad has seen them twice and assures that the other concert he attended was a real blaster, but… yeh, it was a special tour where marty collaborated. \n\n2. i’d buy tickets even if marty doesn’t play because i obviously love the band by itself, the thing is that i’m moving to another country this year so i’ll be pretty tight on money and also im pREEEGnant lol, so it’d be a lot of hassle for me to make it to the concert. i’d rather put my money into something that actually feels worth it, you know?\n\nyou know is pretty common for bands to invite old relevant members and marty is prolly their most iconic ex gp, so… let me know what you think, thx :D",

    "content": "I've been thinking about the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises. How much of a part did they play in introducing younger audiences to classic rock music in the '00s?\n\nI was 12 when Guitar Hero III and the first Rock Band games were released. Those games were everywhere for a few years. Even my friends who've never had an interest in classic rock are familiar with the songs from those soundtracks, because they played along to them as kids, with their friends and siblings.\n\nNowadays, the odd classic tune will blow up on TikTok. But, with terrestrial radio being less and less present in everyday life, that seems to be the only regular means of exposure for kids to classic songs.\n\nReal-life musicians like Post Malone (who, I understand will elicit mixed reactions in a rock subgenre) has spoken about his love for Guitar Hero, and how it introduced him to different artists. \n\nI've become a big Beatles fan over the past two decades, and have spoken to many other fans about how their first taste of the Beatles was through The Beatles: Rock Band as kids.\n\nWhat do you think these games' legacies were in bringing this music into young people's spaces in the late 2000's? Could they have helped create, whether consciously or subconsciously, the next generation of rock musicians?",

It's so fun, I've met so many people and music has shaped my entire life. But 20 minutes before I get on stage I'm nauseous with anxiety and regretting ever picking up a guitar and mic. When I get on stage, I literally black out and rely on muscle memory to get me through the songs cause I'm just NOT there 😥 it doesn't help that we're a girl band and our local music scene is very much a boy's club.

    "content": "Welcome back to the \"Rock'n'Blues Experience\" coming up today \nwe catch up with Status Quo's original drummer John Coghlan to talk about the just released \"Quo Live \" Super deluxe \n\n\n\nJohn Robert “Spud” Coghlan (born 19 September 1946, Dulwich, London) is best known as the powerhouse drummer who helped shape Status Quo’s signature boogie‑rock sound. He joined in 1962 when they were known as The Spectres, progressing through names like Traffic Jam before officially becoming Status Quo in 1967 \nSelf-taught through jazz records and Air Cadets drumming lessons, Coghlan quickly developed a dynamic, driving style.\nHe was the rhythmic force behind their biggest hits: “Pictures of Matchstick Men,” “Paper Plane,” “Caroline,” “Down Down,” “Rockin’ All Over the World,” and more \nloudersound.com\n\n.\nStatus Quo’s reliable but simple chord-driven boogie rock became a hallmark of 1970s rock culture, fuelled by Spud’s steadfast backbeat .\n Pressure and Departure (1981)\nThe band’s fast-paced lifestyle and rampant cocaine use left Coghlan feeling isolated—he preferred a pint to pills \n\n.\nDuring recording of the album 1+9+8+2 in Switzerland, tensions peaked: Coghlan famously snapped, throwing his drum kit and walking out mid-session, then immediately boarded a flight home to the Isle of Man \n\nHe officially left the band at the end of 1981, marking the end of the original “Frantic Four” lineup\n\n\nAfter departing, Coghlan remained musically active:\nJohn Coghlan’s Diesel Band (formed 1977; later reformed post-1985) \n\n.\nPlayed on a one-off Rockers single with Phil Lynott, Roy Wood, and Chas Hodges \n\n.\nFormed John Coghlan’s Quo in the late 1990s, dedicated to the early Quo catalogue and steeped in boogie‑rock tradition, and still performing today \n\n\n\nIn 2013–14, the “Frantic Four” reunited (Coghlan, Rossi, Parfitt, Lancaster) for two major tours—selling out venues and celebrating their classic era \n\n.\nAfter the loss of Rick Parfitt (2016) and Alan Lancaster (2021), Coghlan has continued touring with John Coghlan’s Quo, including farewell shows through 2025 \n\n🏡 Personal Life &amp; Interests\nHe grew up in Dulwich, dropped school at 15 to become a mechanic, and now lives in Shilton, Oxfordshire, with wife Gillie (they’ve been married over 30 years) \n\n.\nPreviously lived on the Isle of Man (1976–86) as a tax exile \niomtoday.co.im\n.\nPassionate about vintage vehicles and military/4×4 machines; a patron of the “Westie ReHoming” charity \n\n.\n\nHis latest venture, John Coghlan’s Quo, blends early Quo hits with rare deep cuts like “A Year” and “Spring, Summer and Wednesdays” \n\n.\nThe band also released original singles like Lockdown (2020) and No Return (2024) \n\n.\nAt 78 years young, Coghlan’s garnering acclaim for reinterpreting Quo classics in jazz‑styled sets at festivals in Oxfordshire, Isle of Man, and beyond .\nHis farewell tour in 2025 will conclude at the Quo convention in Minehead this September\n\n.\n\nJohn Coghlan is more than a legendary drummer—he’s an enduring torchbearer for Status Quo’s boogie rock legacy. From his captivating rhythms that defined an era, to his bold departure in 1981, through decades of reinvention, reunions, and now a farewell, he remains a vibrant and humble presence in the rock world.\n\nIf you’re a fan of classic rock, boogie, or pure rhythmic energy, Coghlan’s story is a must‑know. Happy to dive deeper into his recordings,",

    "content": "Hello! Very small and uninformed musician here. \n\nI recently released a song last week through DistroKid that - prior to releasing - sounded FANTASTIC. I thought the mixing and mastering was done very well (I’ve known my sound engineer for a few years at this point.) \n\nI await patiently for my song to come on Spotify so I can give it a listen in rotation to my playlists. I notice though, that it’s strangely… quiet compared to the other songs. I have the volume normalization on from DistroKid and on Spotify, yet I still find my vocals too low and the bass too high.\n\nMy question is this: if the issue was specifically to raise my vocals and lower the bass frequency, would I be able to get the song remastered or would I have to get the entire project remixed? I apologize as my knowledge to this is VERY amateur.\n\n(I upgraded my DistroKid account to be able to replace the audio file, so there’s no issue there once it is resolved.)",

Jordison’s family has announced that they are planning to release the debut project from his post-Slipknot band, Vimic, its release was delayed due to the passing of producer Kato Khandwala in 2018 and Jordison’s passing in 2021. They released 4 singles but never dropped a proper album. Until now.\n\nThe release of Open Your Omen was supported through a Kickstarter campaign and will be accompanied by a special reunion show in Los Angeles on October 3, 2025, honoring Jordison’s legacy. The show will feature performances by Vimic, special guests, and iconic drummers playing on Jordison’s drum kit.\n\nComing this October 3rd Joey’s highly anticipated “Open Your Omen” will be available for preorder along with its new single\n‘In Your Shadow’ is out now.\n\nTo Joey, your music and legacy continue to inspire and energize fans around the world. We miss you, but your impact lives on through the rhythms and riffs that still move us. Thank you for the unforgettable beats and the memories that will forever echo.\n\nWe love you, Joey. ① 🖤 🥁",

As life gets harder for all, these craven lunatics will only coalesce more and more power through increasingly cult-like, sycophantic worshipers.\n\nInspired by the likes of Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, Nick Fuentes, Joe Rogan, and the rest of the \"alternative media\" ghouls promulgating baseless terrors, while profiteering off of our collapsing institutions and rapidly degraded sense of a shared objective reality.\n\nHope ya'll enjoy, and stay safe.

    "content": "It all started back in April 2010, when three musicians — Atha, Philipp, and Tony — got together at Atha’s house to record one song.\nWe instantly connected through the spirit of rock’n’roll — one song became two, then three, then ten… and soon our first EP and live shows followed.\n\nFunny enough, each of us came from a different background:\nAtha is Greek, Philipp is German, and Tony is Russian.\nAnd, naturally, each of us preferred our own kind of drink — but when creating music, we drank them all together.\n\nThat’s how every track we’ve written has probably been fueled by beer (Philipp, being a true German, can drink unthinkable amounts of it), ouzo (which Atha taught us to sip slowly and enjoy properly), and stronger stuff like brandy, whiskey, or vodka — Tony’s choice.\n\nOver time, this mix of national drinks turned into a ritual — a tradition that has stayed with The Helldozers ever since.\nBefore every show, we line up disposable shot cups along the edge of the stage — one filled with vodka, the next with ouzo, alternating — and invite the audience to come forward, grab a shot (without knowing which one they’ll get!) and drink it with us before we start playing.\n\nPhilipp usually jokes from the stage that our music sounds even better that way.\nAnd for 15 years now, we’ve kept that tradition alive wherever it’s technically possible — as Philipp always says:\n“Come to the stage and have a drink with us — it makes the music sound even better!” 🍻\n\nThis tradition actually became so well-known that for several years we even had an endorsement deal with a vodka brand, which provided us with a full crate for every show. 🍸\n\nAnd if you’re curious what that spirit led to, check out our new album Parasite 2025.",

The source recordings themselves are traditional works firmly in the public domain: [https://archive.org/details/negroprisonsongs](https://archive.org/details/negroprisonsongs)\n\nALBUM COVER: JEFF COPUS \n\nThis project does not use or rely upon any commercial reissues, remasters, or compilations. Instead, all audio sources were taken from the publicly available archival materials which remain free for scholarly and creative use.   \n\nThe vocals heard here have been carefully restored and reinterpreted from the original field recordings. New instrumentation and arrangements were added with the intention of amplifying their voices: C. B. Cook, Dan Barnes, Benny Will Richardson, and Henry Jimpson-Wallace. This album, Roar Like Thunder, is offered in the spirit of cultural preservation, education, and respect for the incarcerated people whose music survived against the odds. \n\nTen percent of proceeds will be donated to the Association for Cultural Equity (ACE) (founded by Alan Lomax) to support preservation of world music traditions: [https://www.culturalequity.org/](https://www.culturalequity.org/)\n\nAnother ten percent to the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) (founded by Bryan Stevenson), which works to end mass incarceration and racial injustice: [https://eji.org/](https://eji.org/)\n\n[GET THE MUSIC](https://petefrengel.hearnow.com/)",

    "title": "Pink Floyd - When the Tigers Broke Free (1982)",
    "content": "While Roger Waters was likely deeply anti-war, and the song’s lyrics imply what a waste of his father’s life from the battle, and the cavalier attitude of the British leadership, to me, the song expresses the nobility of war. The ultimate test of your fear and determination. The ultimate struggle. The ultimate sacrifice.\nIt makes the issues we’re concerned with today seem minor and unimportant when nations oppose each other. At the end of the next section from Wikipedia, it says that his father reversed his position, and took the risk and joined the war effort because he saw the evilness of the Nazis that had to be stopped at all costs.\n\n“The song sets up the story premise for The Wall movie, set over footage recreating the British contribution to Operation Shingle, where American and British troops landed on the beaches near Anzio, Italy, with the goal of liberating Rome from German control. These forces included Z Company of the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, in which Waters' father Eric served.[5] As Waters tells it, the forward commander had asked to withdraw his forces from a German Tiger I tank assault, but the generals refused, and \"the generals gave thanks / As the other ranks / Held back the enemy tanks for a while\" and \"the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price / Of a few hundred ordinary lives\" as the German assault inflicted heavy losses including Eric Waters.\nIn the second verse of the song (which makes up the reprise later in The Wall film), Waters describes how he found a letter of condolence from the British government, described as a note from George VI in the form of a gold leaf scroll which \"His Majesty signed / with his own rubber stamp.\" Waters' resentment then explodes in the final line \"And that's how the High Command took my daddy from me.\"\nThe underlying theme of the song is one of the primary catalysts for the character Pink's descent into isolation throughout the story of The Wall, especially in the film version.[6]\nOn 18 February 2014, 70 years to the day after his father was killed at Anzio,[7] Waters unveiled a memorial to the 8th Battalion, and his father, near to the site of the battle. Another monument had already been erected at the approximate spot where his father fell. After many years of not knowing the details of what happened on that fateful day, Waters was finally able to get some closure after 93-year-old Fusilier and Anzio veteran Harry Shindler uncovered precise details of the time and place of Waters' father's death. Both of them were present at the unveiling of the memorial.[8]\nWaters has indicated that his father was originally a conscientious objector during the outbreak of the Second World War. However, as the German expansion grew, Waters' father felt compelled to join the armed forces. Waters goes on to say, \"So he went back to the conscription board in London and told them he had changed his mind. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, which is how he ended up here 70 years ago. He believed he was involved in a necessary fight against the Nazis, and for that he paid the ultimate price.\"[9] (Wikipedia)",

It has been out for almost a year now, and we are slowly beginning to build a solid fanbase. The feedback we get is that we are a solid blend of Nirvana/Foos/Biffy so if you like these bands it would be great if you could check us out.\n\nWe recently updated our cover art, so let us know what you think. It was designed and drawn by my brother (who I am scared of) our drummer. \n\nWe have our first gig coming up with Scotland Rocks Radio in december so we are busy prepping for that, and we are back in the studio next weekend to finish off 6 more songs which we will be releasing as singles.\n\nI have included our Spotify link below, but we are on all other platforms if you don't use it.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/7FWj9E465vHktCqqFQZ3EO?si=SXUFGwebRnGBvMvufhq2ow\n\nKeep rocking on ya Legends 🤘🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🧨💥",

    "content": "**ROR-Reflection of Reality - Progressive Rockband**  \n– inspiriert von Bands wie Tool und Rage Against the Machine, verbindet das Trio komplexe Arrangements, ungewöhnliche Taktarten und dynamischen Ausdruck mit jugendlicher Energie. Ihre 7- bis 12-minütigen Instrumentals bewegen sich zwischen atmosphärischer Ruhe und kraftvollen Höhepunkten. Jeder Titel erzählt eine eigene Geschichte – oft mit reduziertem, manchmal auch ganz ohne Gesang, aber stets eindringlich. Durch technische Finesse, Experimentierfreude und einen frischen Ansatz bereichert **ROR** den Progressive Rock auf moderne Weise.",

It kind of ruins their legacy to me, because they have great classic albums but also a lot of mediocre and bad albums. Should have ended the band when they were on top. The Who also should have called it quits when Keith Moon and John died in my opinion. There are a lot of bands i feel should have called it a day but what are your guys opinions.",

The EP opens with two darker tracks – Prisoners and Targets – inspired by the troubled times we’re living through. The second half moves toward a more melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere.\n\nIt’s both intimidating and exciting to put these first pieces out into the world, and I’d be truly grateful for any feedback – on the writing, the production, or just the overall mood.\n\nIf anyone here is based in Paris and relates to this kind of sound, I’d love to connect and maybe collaborate on future tracks.\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to listen!",

    "content": "My band REGINA just released *Liminal Space* — it’s somewhere between alternative metal and stoner/psychedelic, with a bit of grunge grit and ambient atmosphere woven in. It leans heavy but isn’t afraid of space or mood; riffs can shift from melodic spacey leads to sharper alt-metal crunch, while the vocals move between ethereal, melodic passages and raw, emotive bursts. It’s meant to feel like that in-between state... not fully one genre or another, but floating somewhere on the edge of heavy and dreamlike. Would love to know what you think of this kind of mix :) [You can check it out on all streaming platforms or BandCamp.](https://www.submithub.com/link/regina-liminal-space) We are from Montevideo, Uruguay!",

I really wished that he would have either done something different with his sound throughout the years to keep it fresh, or focussed more on filmmaking because I find his filmmaking career so much more interesting and creative.\n\nObviously he’s an icon and he’s never made a bad album per se, I just think his schtick doesn’t have the staying power to warrant the same album time and time again",

They're legends for a reason. The setlist was perfect, and the band's performance was tight and atmospheric. But... the mix in our venue was just kinda muddy. Chino's vocals were buried for a good chunk of the set, and the low end was a bit overwhelming. Still a 8/10 experience because it's the 'Tones.\n\n**Chevelle:** HOLY. CRAP. I was not prepared. From the first note, the mix was absolutely pristine. Pete's voice was crystal clear, the guitar tones were crushing yet distinct, and the drums hit you right in the chest. It was one of the best-sounding live mixes I've ever heard. They played with so much raw energy and precision.\n\nIt just shocked me that a band I consider (musically) less layered and complex than Deftones delivered a far superior audio experience. Anyone else had a similar experience with these two live?",

As a left-handed player, he famously restrung right-handed guitars upside down, developing a completely unique technique.\n\n\n\nHe honed his craft as a backing guitarist for touring R&amp;B acts on the \"Chitlin' Circuit,\" playing with icons like Little Richard, The Isley Brothers, and Sam Cooke. Though he was a phenomenal player, he felt stifled creatively in these roles and longed to lead his own band.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Breakthrough and Stardom (1966-1969)\\*\\*\n\nIn 1966, Hendrix moved to New York's Greenwich Village, where he formed Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. It was here that former Animals bassist Chas Chandler discovered him and brought him to London, promising to make him a star.\n\n\n\nChandler became his manager, and Hendrix formed \\*\\*The Jimi Hendrix Experience\\*\\* with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding. The UK music scene was instantly electrified. His raw talent, flamboyant style, and revolutionary approach to the guitar—using feedback, distortion, and wah-wah pedals as expressive tools—blew away his peers, including Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, and The Beatles.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*1967:\\*\\* The release of their first single, \"Hey Joe,\" was followed by the groundbreaking album \\*\\*\\*Are You Experienced\\*\\*\\*, which featured timeless tracks like \"Purple Haze,\" \"Foxy Lady,\" \"The Wind Cries Mary,\" and \"Fire.\"\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Monterey Pop Festival (1967):\\*\\* His incendiary performance, culminating in him setting his guitar on fire, announced him to America and became the stuff of rock and roll legend.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*1968:\\*\\* The critically acclaimed double album \\*\\*\\*Electric Ladyland\\*\\*\\*, featuring his definitive cover of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" and the epic \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return),\" became his only US number one album.\n\n\n\nHendrix was the embodiment of the 1960s counterculture. His performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Woodstock in 1969 was a defining moment—a distorted, psychedelic, and poignant commentary on the state of America during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Final Days and Internal Struggles\\*\\*\n\nBy 1970, The Jimi Hendrix Experience had disbanded. Hendrix was exhausted from a relentless touring schedule, embroiled in complex business disputes, and under pressure from record labels to produce more music. He was experimenting musically, forming a new band called Band of Gypsys with bassist Billy Cox and drummer Buddy Miles, exploring funkier, blues-rooted sounds. Despite his iconic status, he felt immense pressure and was searching for a new musical direction.\n\n\n\n\\### The Mysterious Circumstances of His Death\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Final Night: September 17-18, 1970\\*\\*\n\nAfter a late-night recording session in London, Hendrix spent the early hours of September 18 at a party at the flat of a German model named Monika Dannemann. Sometime around 7 a.m., Dannemann found him unconscious in her bed, unresponsive. She called an ambulance, but Hendrix was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Mary Abbot's Hospital in Kensington at 9:45 a.m.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Cause\\*\\*\n\nThe official inquest ruled his death as \\*\\*asphyxiation due to inhalation of vomit after barbiturate intoxication.\\*\\* He had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping pills, which was nearly double the recommended dose. The coroner recorded an open verdict, meaning there was insufficient evidence to prove whether it was an accident or intentional.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Enduring Mystery and Controversy\\*\\*\n\nThe exact events of that night have been the subject of intense speculation and conflicting accounts for decades.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Monika Dannemann's Story:\\*\\* She claimed that Hendrix took the pills unknowingly, thinking they were her prescribed medication for nerves. She stated she was asleep when it happened and that he had been alive and talking when she called the ambulance.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Conflicting Accounts:\\*\\* Others, including Hendrix's manager Michael Jeffrey, who arrived on the scene, gave different versions. Some suggest Jeffrey may have had something to hide, though this is pure conjecture.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*The Ambulance Call:\\*\\* A key point of controversy is the significant delay between when Dannemann found him and when she called for help. This delay is often cited as a critical factor in his death.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Conspiracy Theories:\\*\\* Over the years, wilder theories have emerged, including suggestions of foul play or a deliberate overdose, but there is no credible evidence to support these claims.\n\n\n\nThe most widely accepted conclusion is that \\*\\*Jimi Hendrix died of a tragic accidental overdose.\\*\\* He was known to have a low tolerance for alcohol and pills, and it is likely he simply misjudged the strength of the medication he ingested.\n\n\n\n\\### Legacy\n\n\n\nJimi Hendrix's life was tragically short—he was only 27 years old, part of the infamous \"27 Club.\" Yet, in just four years as a superstar, he fundamentally changed the landscape of popular music. He expanded the vocabulary of the electric guitar more than any other player before or since.\n\n\n\nHe remains an enduring icon of creativity, innovation, and the psychedelic era—a visionary artist whose music continues to inspire and astonish new generations of listeners and musicians. His death remains a sobering reminder of the pressures of fame and the fragility of genius.",

I have a theory: it is likely that she died by suicide. Axl Rose was a close friend of writer Del James, who wrote the short story Without You (the inspiration for the video). In that story, the fiancée kills herself because she is unhappy in the relationship. After this, the funeral takes place, and the coffin is half-open, just like in the video. In the story, she takes her own life with a gun. Interestingly, in the video there’s a scene where Axl is walking at night and we see a gun shop, which could either be a reference to the band’s name, Guns N’ Roses, or a symbolic hint at the cause of death.",

    "content": "so, marty is my favorite megadeth’s guitar player, and i’m wondering if there’s any chance of him playing w the band for their retirement tour :’) \n\ni know they played together in japan a few months ago but i suppose that’s only because marty basically lives there, so… if i had to guess i’d say that at most that’s what he’s gonna do again.\n\nwhat do you guys know/think? i’m really considering attending to this last tour but gotta be honest with you: \n\n1. i already saw them live once and it was kinda disappointing. i’m a true fan so zero hate about it. but i was super sad since they were really dull and the sound wasn’t great. It was pretty boring tbh. my dad has seen them twice and assures that the other concert he attended was a real blaster, but… yeh, it was a special tour where marty collaborated. \n\n2. i’d buy tickets even if marty doesn’t play because i obviously love the band by itself, the thing is that i’m moving to another country this year so i’ll be pretty tight on money and also im pREEEGnant lol, so it’d be a lot of hassle for me to make it to the concert. i’d rather put my money into something that actually feels worth it, you know?\n\nyou know is pretty common for bands to invite old relevant members and marty is prolly their most iconic ex gp, so… let me know what you think, thx :D",

    "content": "I've been thinking about the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises. How much of a part did they play in introducing younger audiences to classic rock music in the '00s?\n\nI was 12 when Guitar Hero III and the first Rock Band games were released. Those games were everywhere for a few years. Even my friends who've never had an interest in classic rock are familiar with the songs from those soundtracks, because they played along to them as kids, with their friends and siblings.\n\nNowadays, the odd classic tune will blow up on TikTok. But, with terrestrial radio being less and less present in everyday life, that seems to be the only regular means of exposure for kids to classic songs.\n\nReal-life musicians like Post Malone (who, I understand will elicit mixed reactions in a rock subgenre) has spoken about his love for Guitar Hero, and how it introduced him to different artists. \n\nI've become a big Beatles fan over the past two decades, and have spoken to many other fans about how their first taste of the Beatles was through The Beatles: Rock Band as kids.\n\nWhat do you think these games' legacies were in bringing this music into young people's spaces in the late 2000's? Could they have helped create, whether consciously or subconsciously, the next generation of rock musicians?",

    "content": "Welcome back to the \"Rock'n'Blues Experience\" coming up today \nwe catch up with Status Quo's original drummer John Coghlan to talk about the just released \"Quo Live \" Super deluxe \n\n\n\nJohn Robert “Spud” Coghlan (born 19 September 1946, Dulwich, London) is best known as the powerhouse drummer who helped shape Status Quo’s signature boogie‑rock sound. He joined in 1962 when they were known as The Spectres, progressing through names like Traffic Jam before officially becoming Status Quo in 1967 \nSelf-taught through jazz records and Air Cadets drumming lessons, Coghlan quickly developed a dynamic, driving style.\nHe was the rhythmic force behind their biggest hits: “Pictures of Matchstick Men,” “Paper Plane,” “Caroline,” “Down Down,” “Rockin’ All Over the World,” and more \nloudersound.com\n\n.\nStatus Quo’s reliable but simple chord-driven boogie rock became a hallmark of 1970s rock culture, fuelled by Spud’s steadfast backbeat .\n Pressure and Departure (1981)\nThe band’s fast-paced lifestyle and rampant cocaine use left Coghlan feeling isolated—he preferred a pint to pills \n\n.\nDuring recording of the album 1+9+8+2 in Switzerland, tensions peaked: Coghlan famously snapped, throwing his drum kit and walking out mid-session, then immediately boarded a flight home to the Isle of Man \n\nHe officially left the band at the end of 1981, marking the end of the original “Frantic Four” lineup\n\n\nAfter departing, Coghlan remained musically active:\nJohn Coghlan’s Diesel Band (formed 1977; later reformed post-1985) \n\n.\nPlayed on a one-off Rockers single with Phil Lynott, Roy Wood, and Chas Hodges \n\n.\nFormed John Coghlan’s Quo in the late 1990s, dedicated to the early Quo catalogue and steeped in boogie‑rock tradition, and still performing today \n\n\n\nIn 2013–14, the “Frantic Four” reunited (Coghlan, Rossi, Parfitt, Lancaster) for two major tours—selling out venues and celebrating their classic era \n\n.\nAfter the loss of Rick Parfitt (2016) and Alan Lancaster (2021), Coghlan has continued touring with John Coghlan’s Quo, including farewell shows through 2025 \n\n🏡 Personal Life &amp; Interests\nHe grew up in Dulwich, dropped school at 15 to become a mechanic, and now lives in Shilton, Oxfordshire, with wife Gillie (they’ve been married over 30 years) \n\n.\nPreviously lived on the Isle of Man (1976–86) as a tax exile \niomtoday.co.im\n.\nPassionate about vintage vehicles and military/4×4 machines; a patron of the “Westie ReHoming” charity \n\n.\n\nHis latest venture, John Coghlan’s Quo, blends early Quo hits with rare deep cuts like “A Year” and “Spring, Summer and Wednesdays” \n\n.\nThe band also released original singles like Lockdown (2020) and No Return (2024) \n\n.\nAt 78 years young, Coghlan’s garnering acclaim for reinterpreting Quo classics in jazz‑styled sets at festivals in Oxfordshire, Isle of Man, and beyond .\nHis farewell tour in 2025 will conclude at the Quo convention in Minehead this September\n\n.\n\nJohn Coghlan is more than a legendary drummer—he’s an enduring torchbearer for Status Quo’s boogie rock legacy. From his captivating rhythms that defined an era, to his bold departure in 1981, through decades of reinvention, reunions, and now a farewell, he remains a vibrant and humble presence in the rock world.\n\nIf you’re a fan of classic rock, boogie, or pure rhythmic energy, Coghlan’s story is a must‑know. Happy to dive deeper into his recordings,",

    "content": "Hello! Very small and uninformed musician here. \n\nI recently released a song last week through DistroKid that - prior to releasing - sounded FANTASTIC. I thought the mixing and mastering was done very well (I’ve known my sound engineer for a few years at this point.) \n\nI await patiently for my song to come on Spotify so I can give it a listen in rotation to my playlists. I notice though, that it’s strangely… quiet compared to the other songs. I have the volume normalization on from DistroKid and on Spotify, yet I still find my vocals too low and the bass too high.\n\nMy question is this: if the issue was specifically to raise my vocals and lower the bass frequency, would I be able to get the song remastered or would I have to get the entire project remixed? I apologize as my knowledge to this is VERY amateur.\n\n(I upgraded my DistroKid account to be able to replace the audio file, so there’s no issue there once it is resolved.)",

    "content": "As some Queen and Freddie Mercury fans may know, in 2019 was released \"Never Boring\", a album with remixes and remasters of Freddie's solo work, and they released a \"alternative version\" of \"Time\" from \"Time - The Musical\" by Dave Clark.\n\nShort story, the videoclip which the song was released with, was taken down from the official solo channel of Freddie, so, in a way to \"preserve\" that content, I decided to reupload the videoclip in 4K upscaled.\n\nHad some problems with UMC, but after 30 days with my appeal without being answered, now the videoclip seems to be without any DMCA complaint, so please, feel free to watch it or download it, I don't know how much time will it be before taken down.",

As life gets harder for all, these craven lunatics will only coalesce more and more power through increasingly cult-like, sycophantic worshipers.\n\nInspired by the likes of Elon Musk, Jordan Peterson, Nick Fuentes, Joe Rogan, and the rest of the \"alternative media\" ghouls promulgating baseless terrors, while profiteering off of our collapsing institutions and rapidly degraded sense of a shared objective reality.\n\nHope ya'll enjoy, and stay safe.

    "content": "It all started back in April 2010, when three musicians — Atha, Philipp, and Tony — got together at Atha’s house to record one song.\nWe instantly connected through the spirit of rock’n’roll — one song became two, then three, then ten… and soon our first EP and live shows followed.\n\nFunny enough, each of us came from a different background:\nAtha is Greek, Philipp is German, and Tony is Russian.\nAnd, naturally, each of us preferred our own kind of drink — but when creating music, we drank them all together.\n\nThat’s how every track we’ve written has probably been fueled by beer (Philipp, being a true German, can drink unthinkable amounts of it), ouzo (which Atha taught us to sip slowly and enjoy properly), and stronger stuff like brandy, whiskey, or vodka — Tony’s choice.\n\nOver time, this mix of national drinks turned into a ritual — a tradition that has stayed with The Helldozers ever since.\nBefore every show, we line up disposable shot cups along the edge of the stage — one filled with vodka, the next with ouzo, alternating — and invite the audience to come forward, grab a shot (without knowing which one they’ll get!) and drink it with us before we start playing.\n\nPhilipp usually jokes from the stage that our music sounds even better that way.\nAnd for 15 years now, we’ve kept that tradition alive wherever it’s technically possible — as Philipp always says:\n“Come to the stage and have a drink with us — it makes the music sound even better!” 🍻\n\nThis tradition actually became so well-known that for several years we even had an endorsement deal with a vodka brand, which provided us with a full crate for every show. 🍸\n\nAnd if you’re curious what that spirit led to, check out our new album Parasite 2025.",

    "content": "\"Come Dancing\" is a tribute to Davies' older sister Rene. Living in Canada with her reportedly abusive husband, the 31-year-old Rene was visiting her childhood home in Fortis Green in London at the time of Ray Davies' 13th birthday—21 June 1957—on which she surprised him with a gift of the Spanish guitar he had tried to persuade his parents to buy him.[3] That evening, Rene, who had a weak heart as a result of a childhood bout of rheumatic fever, suffered a fatal heart attack while dancing at the Lyceum ballroom.” (Wikipedia)\n\nI totally thought this was a 60s song. Really surprised it was 80s. Released Nov 82, but video was 1983 is my guess.",

This is a track from the new album ***Roar Like Thunder***, just released on major streaming platforms (see the link at the bottom of this post). Pete Frengel is a musician living in central PA, and was inspired to create the album after hearing songs drawn from traditional African American prison work songs recorded in 1947 at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman Farm). These recordings have been preserved and made publicly accessible through the Internet Archive. The source recordings themselves are traditional works firmly in the public domain: [https://archive.org/details/negroprisonsongs](https://archive.org/details/negroprisonsongs)\n\nALBUM COVER: JEFF COPUS \n\nThis project does not use or rely upon any commercial reissues, remasters, or compilations. Instead, all audio sources were taken from the publicly available archival materials which remain free for scholarly and creative use.   \n\nThe vocals heard here have been carefully restored and reinterpreted from the original field recordings. New instrumentation and arrangements were added with the intention of amplifying their voices: C. B. Cook, Dan Barnes, Benny Will Richardson, and Henry Jimpson-Wallace. This album, Roar Like Thunder, is offered in the spirit of cultural preservation, education, and respect for the incarcerated people whose music survived against the odds. \n\nTen percent of proceeds will be donated to the Association for Cultural Equity (ACE) (founded by Alan Lomax) to support preservation of world music traditions: [https://www.culturalequity.org/](https://www.culturalequity.org/)\n\nAnother ten percent to the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) (founded by Bryan Stevenson), which works to end mass incarceration and racial injustice: [https://eji.org/](https://eji.org/)\n\n[GET THE MUSIC](https://petefrengel.hearnow.com/)",

    "title": "Pink Floyd - When the Tigers Broke Free (1982)",
    "content": "While Roger Waters was likely deeply anti-war, and the song’s lyrics imply what a waste of his father’s life from the battle, and the cavalier attitude of the British leadership, to me, the song expresses the nobility of war. The ultimate test of your fear and determination. The ultimate struggle. The ultimate sacrifice.\nIt makes the issues we’re concerned with today seem minor and unimportant when nations oppose each other. At the end of the next section from Wikipedia, it says that his father reversed his position, and took the risk and joined the war effort because he saw the evilness of the Nazis that had to be stopped at all costs.\n\n“The song sets up the story premise for The Wall movie, set over footage recreating the British contribution to Operation Shingle, where American and British troops landed on the beaches near Anzio, Italy, with the goal of liberating Rome from German control. These forces included Z Company of the 8th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, in which Waters' father Eric served.[5] As Waters tells it, the forward commander had asked to withdraw his forces from a German Tiger I tank assault, but the generals refused, and \"the generals gave thanks / As the other ranks / Held back the enemy tanks for a while\" and \"the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price / Of a few hundred ordinary lives\" as the German assault inflicted heavy losses including Eric Waters.\nIn the second verse of the song (which makes up the reprise later in The Wall film), Waters describes how he found a letter of condolence from the British government, described as a note from George VI in the form of a gold leaf scroll which \"His Majesty signed / with his own rubber stamp.\" Waters' resentment then explodes in the final line \"And that's how the High Command took my daddy from me.\"\nThe underlying theme of the song is one of the primary catalysts for the character Pink's descent into isolation throughout the story of The Wall, especially in the film version.[6]\nOn 18 February 2014, 70 years to the day after his father was killed at Anzio,[7] Waters unveiled a memorial to the 8th Battalion, and his father, near to the site of the battle. Another monument had already been erected at the approximate spot where his father fell. After many years of not knowing the details of what happened on that fateful day, Waters was finally able to get some closure after 93-year-old Fusilier and Anzio veteran Harry Shindler uncovered precise details of the time and place of Waters' father's death. Both of them were present at the unveiling of the memorial.[8]\nWaters has indicated that his father was originally a conscientious objector during the outbreak of the Second World War. However, as the German expansion grew, Waters' father felt compelled to join the armed forces. Waters goes on to say, \"So he went back to the conscription board in London and told them he had changed his mind. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, which is how he ended up here 70 years ago. He believed he was involved in a necessary fight against the Nazis, and for that he paid the ultimate price.\"[9] (Wikipedia)",

It kind of ruins their legacy to me, because they have great classic albums but also a lot of mediocre and bad albums. Should have ended the band when they were on top. The Who also should have called it quits when Keith Moon and John died in my opinion. There are a lot of bands i feel should have called it a day but what are your guys opinions.",

The EP opens with two darker tracks – Prisoners and Targets – inspired by the troubled times we’re living through. The second half moves toward a more melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere.\n\nIt’s both intimidating and exciting to put these first pieces out into the world, and I’d be truly grateful for any feedback – on the writing, the production, or just the overall mood.\n\nIf anyone here is based in Paris and relates to this kind of sound, I’d love to connect and maybe collaborate on future tracks.\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to listen!",

It leans heavy but isn’t afraid of space or mood; riffs can shift from melodic spacey leads to sharper alt-metal crunch, while the vocals move between ethereal, melodic passages and raw, emotive bursts. It’s meant to feel like that in-between state... not fully one genre or another, but floating somewhere on the edge of heavy and dreamlike. Would love to know what you think of this kind of mix :) [You can check it out on all streaming platforms or BandCamp.](https://www.submithub.com/link/regina-liminal-space) We are from Montevideo, Uruguay!",

I really wished that he would have either done something different with his sound throughout the years to keep it fresh, or focussed more on filmmaking because I find his filmmaking career so much more interesting and creative.\n\nObviously he’s an icon and he’s never made a bad album per se, I just think his schtick doesn’t have the staying power to warrant the same album time and time again",

    "content": "Just need to share this with people who might get it. I was lucky enough to catch Deftones last monday and Chevelle just last night.\n\n**Deftones:** Amazing, of course. They're legends for a reason. The setlist was perfect, and the band's performance was tight and atmospheric. But... the mix in our venue was just kinda muddy. Chino's vocals were buried for a good chunk of the set, and the low end was a bit overwhelming. Still a 8/10 experience because it's the 'Tones.\n\n**Chevelle:** HOLY. CRAP. I was not prepared. From the first note, the mix was absolutely pristine. Pete's voice was crystal clear, the guitar tones were crushing yet distinct, and the drums hit you right in the chest. It was one of the best-sounding live mixes I've ever heard. They played with so much raw energy and precision.\n\nIt just shocked me that a band I consider (musically) less layered and complex than Deftones delivered a far superior audio experience. Anyone else had a similar experience with these two live?",

    "title": "A Life of Revolutionary Sound: The Journey of Jimi Hendrix",
    "content": "A Life of Revolutionary Sound: The Journey of Jimi Hendrix\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Early Life (1942-1966)\\*\\*\n\nBorn Johnny Allen Hendrix (later renamed James Marshall Hendrix) on November 27, 1942, in Seattle, Washington, Jimi's early life was marked by poverty and family instability. His connection to music began with a ukulele and then a second-hand acoustic guitar. As a left-handed player, he famously restrung right-handed guitars upside down, developing a completely unique technique.\n\n\n\nHe honed his craft as a backing guitarist for touring R&amp;B acts on the \"Chitlin' Circuit,\" playing with icons like Little Richard, The Isley Brothers, and Sam Cooke. Though he was a phenomenal player, he felt stifled creatively in these roles and longed to lead his own band.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Breakthrough and Stardom (1966-1969)\\*\\*\n\nIn 1966, Hendrix moved to New York's Greenwich Village, where he formed Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. It was here that former Animals bassist Chas Chandler discovered him and brought him to London, promising to make him a star.\n\n\n\nChandler became his manager, and Hendrix formed \\*\\*The Jimi Hendrix Experience\\*\\* with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding. The UK music scene was instantly electrified. His raw talent, flamboyant style, and revolutionary approach to the guitar—using feedback, distortion, and wah-wah pedals as expressive tools—blew away his peers, including Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend, and The Beatles.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*1967:\\*\\* The release of their first single, \"Hey Joe,\" was followed by the groundbreaking album \\*\\*\\*Are You Experienced\\*\\*\\*, which featured timeless tracks like \"Purple Haze,\" \"Foxy Lady,\" \"The Wind Cries Mary,\" and \"Fire.\"\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Monterey Pop Festival (1967):\\*\\* His incendiary performance, culminating in him setting his guitar on fire, announced him to America and became the stuff of rock and roll legend.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*1968:\\*\\* The critically acclaimed double album \\*\\*\\*Electric Ladyland\\*\\*\\*, featuring his definitive cover of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" and the epic \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return),\" became his only US number one album.\n\n\n\nHendrix was the embodiment of the 1960s counterculture. His performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at Woodstock in 1969 was a defining moment—a distorted, psychedelic, and poignant commentary on the state of America during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Final Days and Internal Struggles\\*\\*\n\nBy 1970, The Jimi Hendrix Experience had disbanded. Hendrix was exhausted from a relentless touring schedule, embroiled in complex business disputes, and under pressure from record labels to produce more music. He was experimenting musically, forming a new band called Band of Gypsys with bassist Billy Cox and drummer Buddy Miles, exploring funkier, blues-rooted sounds. Despite his iconic status, he felt immense pressure and was searching for a new musical direction.\n\n\n\n\\### The Mysterious Circumstances of His Death\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Final Night: September 17-18, 1970\\*\\*\n\nAfter a late-night recording session in London, Hendrix spent the early hours of September 18 at a party at the flat of a German model named Monika Dannemann. Sometime around 7 a.m., Dannemann found him unconscious in her bed, unresponsive. She called an ambulance, but Hendrix was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Mary Abbot's Hospital in Kensington at 9:45 a.m.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Cause\\*\\*\n\nThe official inquest ruled his death as \\*\\*asphyxiation due to inhalation of vomit after barbiturate intoxication.\\*\\* He had taken nine of her prescribed Vesparax sleeping pills, which was nearly double the recommended dose. The coroner recorded an open verdict, meaning there was insufficient evidence to prove whether it was an accident or intentional.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The Enduring Mystery and Controversy\\*\\*\n\nThe exact events of that night have been the subject of intense speculation and conflicting accounts for decades.\n\n\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Monika Dannemann's Story:\\*\\* She claimed that Hendrix took the pills unknowingly, thinking they were her prescribed medication for nerves. She stated she was asleep when it happened and that he had been alive and talking when she called the ambulance.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Conflicting Accounts:\\*\\* Others, including Hendrix's manager Michael Jeffrey, who arrived on the scene, gave different versions. Some suggest Jeffrey may have had something to hide, though this is pure conjecture.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*The Ambulance Call:\\*\\* A key point of controversy is the significant delay between when Dannemann found him and when she called for help. This delay is often cited as a critical factor in his death.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*Conspiracy Theories:\\*\\* Over the years, wilder theories have emerged, including suggestions of foul play or a deliberate overdose, but there is no credible evidence to support these claims.\n\n\n\nThe most widely accepted conclusion is that \\*\\*Jimi Hendrix died of a tragic accidental overdose.\\*\\* He was known to have a low tolerance for alcohol and pills, and it is likely he simply misjudged the strength of the medication he ingested.\n\n\n\n\\### Legacy\n\n\n\nJimi Hendrix's life was tragically short—he was only 27 years old, part of the infamous \"27 Club.\" Yet, in just four years as a superstar, he fundamentally changed the landscape of popular music. He expanded the vocabulary of the electric guitar more than any other player before or since.\n\n\n\nHe remains an enduring icon of creativity, innovation, and the psychedelic era—a visionary artist whose music continues to inspire and astonish new generations of listeners and musicians. His death remains a sobering reminder of the pressures of fame and the fragility of genius.",

    "content": "This is where you can post all requests and recommendations.\n\nIf you're looking for a recommendation give a description/music link/artist so that other people will know what you want.\n\nExample: \"I want to hear an artist that sounds like Royal Blood\" (you can get more specific but usually enough) - and then hopefully someone will respond with recommendations X, Y, and Z.\n\nYou can also leave a top level comment recommending an artist/project/scene that you think others might like if they like X, Y, and Z.\n\nThe more descriptive you guys are, the easier it is to help you find what you want. Just stating an artist's name isn't that helpful since you might only like one specific aspect of that artist's music.\n\nSomeone reported this post last week for playlists - note that you can have playlists in the comments/ here, the rules are for posts in the sub itself.",
