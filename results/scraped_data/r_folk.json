    "content": "Hi guys,\n\nthere's an old folk / neofolk album by Ex-Ensiferum keyboardist Meiju Enho, Mythmusik. Very soothing and atmospheric, Enya-like music.\n\nUnfortunately, It's only scarcely available, I got it via Amazon Music, but unfortunately there are no lyrics included. Does anyone have the booklet with the lyrics (if there are any) or is there a link to the lyrics I haven't found yet?\n\nI'd love to have the lyrics, since they are very echoing and sometimes hardly intelligible.",

    "title": "Folk influences on Russian music I noticed.",
    "content": "SHORT VERSION  \nI noticed that I enjoyed some music from Russia that seemed to have a much different feel than western music. It had some kind of folk influences or instruments but not the folk I am used to.  Such groups do not exist in the US and if they did they would starve. So I asked around and got some answers.   I am familiar with lots of foreign music going way back like Sergio Mendes, Ravi Shankar, Brazilian folk, northern EU  pagan.  but this Russian music had a folk influence that was way different.  Russians can reach back further in time and space compared to US/UK  folk.\n\nIn short, Russians (and other neighbors) can draw on ancient folk music and instruments in modern music if they wish, and they are. USSR  pushed folk music across the USSR including minority region music. After USSR there were lots of re-enactments including folk inspired music. This led to folk inspired music from various regions including Northern EU and  Russia. Some video games included folk music. I included a couple of video links. One is a song from Melntisa as an example. The other is an example of \"buhurt\", modern  medieval fighting in Russia. I asked grok to find the closest western groups to didula. It produced a list and none were close. the closest was Pat Metheny group which was snot even close.\n\nHere is one song from the Russian folk rock group Мельница aka Melnitsa (Mill) formed in 1999.  \n[https://youtu.be/JVNyzmpUFDY](https://youtu.be/JVNyzmpUFDY)  \nМельница - Господин Горных Дорог - Live in Moskva, 5.12.2024  \nHere is another example. OTTA ORCHESTRA  \n[https://youtu.be/C1iL0h-j5p4](https://youtu.be/C1iL0h-j5p4)\n\ndidula [https://youtu.be/58Zd8PUuHQo?list=RD58Zd8PUuHQo&amp;t=384](https://youtu.be/58Zd8PUuHQo?list=RD58Zd8PUuHQo&amp;t=384)\n\notava yo [https://youtu.be/Wdfg602XEls](https://youtu.be/Wdfg602XEls)\n\nMUSICTOGETHER / МУЗЫКАВМЕСТЕ [https://youtu.be/AGtl-gU978A](https://youtu.be/AGtl-gU978A)\n\n#  \n\n# LONG VERSION\n\n# There is a female vocalist/harpist/song writer, acoustic guitar, woodwind, bass, percussion.\n\n#  [https://youtu.be/Qcg12Z8kAx0?t=1142](https://youtu.be/Qcg12Z8kAx0?t=1142)\n\nNote the crowd size and how they sing along.  \nWhy is this group in Russia but not US?  \nIn US folk music means UK and US folk music using UK instruments like guitar, banjo, fiddle. If you go  back in time before European settlement say 1600 there is no older folk music in North America but there was elsewhere in the world. Native Americans  IMO had little and did not pass it on. They did not write it down or draw the instruments. I recall 500 nations in North America?   \nI follow Russian musician Alina Gingertail and notice instruments. Many are folk instruments that go further back in time. She first played a 3 stringed domra that only was reproduced because a broken domra was found in a barn in 1896. It was first made in 1500s, evolved from Turkish instruments, and banned in 1648 by the tsar.  \nShe also plays the Gudok (1000 AD) and Rebec (900 AD). None of these survived. They were recreated from sketches and maybe fragments found in peat bogs. Also Gusli (1000 AD) and Psaltery (900 AD). Also Svirel (900 AD).Hammered dulcimer (900 AD). Many evolved from Turkish or other middle eastern instruments. Anyway, these and other folk instruments evolved are part of Russian and other folk music.  \nThe USSR supported such folk music and standardized it. Many towns and villages had a \"house of culture\" where such music was played, sometimes by official USSR folk groups. So this kept the traditions alive through 1990 and people all learned the same folk songs growing up although the USSR encouraged minority folk music across the USSR.\n\nFrom r/askarussian  \n**In the USSR, folk music was utilized as a significant ideological tool for cultural propaganda, fostering national unity and a unified Soviet identity by celebrating traditional ethnic music and creating state-sponsored folk orchestras and ensembles.** While promoting a positive, proletarian image of Soviet culture, particularly against Western influences, the state also standardized and professionalized folk music, suppressing its spontaneous nature in favor of controlled, choreographed performances and distorting its authenticity.  \n...  \nFinally, there's the identity factor. Russia has a very long history and people are often looking for ways to connect with their cultural roots in a modern form. Not only Russians. I also know some modern folk bands performing in minority languages. The most popular ones, I think, are Otyken and Ay Yola. But there are many more across different genres - for example, I even know a Tatar folk death metal band.  \n...  \n**Melnitsa's lead singer for example, her first audience was a crowd of larpers / reconstruction enthusiasts. Those hobbies saw insane popularity in Russia in 90s and 00s (we are the birthplace of buhurt, fyi)**. At the time it wasn't really folk rock, much rather just simple singer/songwriter stuff which already was super common since the 80s because of Soviet era \"bard music\" (think Vysotsky, Bashlachev and the likes). But the \"setting\" in which it all came about, I think, lead to incorporation of folk elements: lyrically and thematically first, and instrumentally later.  \nModern - like since 2012 to current time - fascination with folk rock imo is more of a global phenomenon. It just happened to become a trend in popular culture. First it was the \"Irish\", then the \"Vikings\" and then the \"Slavic\". This is more thanks to videogames, tv series and all that\n\n...  \n**Grok says**  \n**Buhurt is a modern full-contact combat sport that recreates medieval melee battles, where participants wear full suits of armor (up to 100 pounds) and fight using blunt steel weapons such as swords, axes, and maces.** Fighters compete in team-based \"last-man-standing\" formats, aiming to ground opponents through strikes or grappling, with referees ensuring safety and scoring on points if needed. It's governed by organizations like the International Medieval Combat Federation (IMCF) and Buhurt International (BI), and emphasizes historical authenticity while prioritizing blunt edges to prevent lethal injuries.  \n[https://youtu.be/wuRUbOxi2W4?list=PLVmg3ofLiKGoew6Oc4wg9vULZU6c1Dxkf](https://youtu.be/wuRUbOxi2W4?list=PLVmg3ofLiKGoew6Oc4wg9vULZU6c1Dxkf) **this makes sense now Buhurt. Alina sings while Russians fight.**  \nI later found Slavic folk music. Much Polish. Then German and Scandinavian.  \nBelow is the English translation of the lyrics to Королевна (Queen) by Мельница (Melnitsa), as requested. The song is a poetic folk-rock ballad with mythological and romantic themes, and I've aimed to preserve its lyrical tone while making it natural in English.\n\nThe lyrics below are nothing like anything in the west.  \nQueen (Королевна) – English Translation\\[Instrumental\\]  \n\\[Verse 1\\]  \nI sang of gods and heroes bold,  \nOf clashing blades and battles told;  \nWhile my falcon stayed by my side,  \nHis cry was my prayer, my guide.  \nBut now a year has passed since he flew—  \nA stranger's hand took him, it's true.  \nAnd since that day, I sing alone,  \nOf my queen, my queen, my own.  \n\\[Chorus\\]  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's delight,  \nIn your dark eyes shines the starry night,  \nIn your golden braids, the river's flow.  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's own woe,  \nYou are my fate, my sorrow's call,  \nMy endless, mad, and radiant thrall.\n\n\\[Verse 2\\]  \nI roamed through forests, swamps, and streams,  \nO'er mountains high and rivers' gleams,  \nTo find her trace, to hear her call,  \nTo bring my falcon back, my all.  \nBut found her shadow in moonlight's glow,  \nHer eyes a chasm, her heart aglow.  \nAnd since that night, I sing alone,  \nOf my queen, my queen, my own.\n\n\\[Chorus\\]  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's delight,  \nIn your dark eyes shines the starry night,  \nIn your golden braids, the river's flow.  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's own woe,  \nYou are my fate, my sorrow's call,  \nMy endless, mad, and radiant thrall.\n\n\\[Bridge\\]  \nOh, how the wind howls o'er boundless plains,  \nHow waves crash hard on cliffs' remains!  \nSo my heart lies captive, bound by thee,  \nMy queen, in your spell, I cease to be.\n\n\\[Verse 3\\]  \nNow I sing of love that cannot be,  \nOf parting, longing, memory.  \nOf my falcon soaring in distant skies,  \nAnd of her—my queen with starlit eyes.  \nThough fate may keep us forever apart,  \nA sorceress tearing my beating heart,  \nIn my songs, you'll live eternally,  \nMy queen, my only, my destiny.\n\n\\[Chorus (Outro)\\]  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's delight,  \nIn your dark eyes shines the starry night,  \nIn your golden braids, the river's flow.  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's own woe,  \nYou are my fate, my sorrow's call,  \nMy endless, mad, and radiant thrall...  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nNotes  \n•   The translation keeps the poetic and emotional essence, reflecting the song's folkloric and romantic themes. Imagery like the falcon, starry eyes, and river-like braids draws from Slavic mythology and nature.",

His influence on Croce’s sound can’t be overstated. He too died in that same plane crash as Jim. Maury was a young 24 years old.\n\nMaury was, and will always be remembered as, an unsung hero of Jim Croce’s legacy.",

    "title": "Show Thoughts: The Tallest Man On Earth at The 9:30 Club on Sunday, October 5th (With The Still Tide)",
    "content": "I saw the Tallest Man on Earth on Sunday, October 5th at The 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., and it was a very intimate show. Maybe the most intimate that I’ve been to. The music was very good, as (Kristian Mattson) is such a special guitarist and overall performer. He definitely requires a certain taste just because his voice is, well, his voice. It’s not pretty, but it’s oh so powerful if you like it. But it was clear that he was playing around with some ideas of his on how to play songs differently. I didn’t like all the experiments, all the different versions, but I respected them for what they were, because they all seemed to come from his desire to pull something new from his songs. A very folk mindset, but I still think he is not your stereotypical folk singer. I also think he puts pressure on himself to learn new instruments, and that’s partly why he’s thrusting them into his songs. \n\nAnyways, my biggest takeaway from the show was not necessarily the music, but the things Mattson said. The short stories he told, and the honesty he gave to the audience about his life, and the way he shared his view of the world (a small version of that view, atleast). I really like the way he shares what he’s thinking, it is fascinating to me. \n\nSo, the music was wonderful. I think it was better the first time I saw him, but I am such a fan, so “better” doesn’t feel like an accurate term, because I am almost always going to think his songs are great live unless he plays a banjo version that I don’t enjoy as much for every song. I felt the music more the first time, I guess, and the second time, I felt Mattson more overall, in addition to his music. But enough with the comparisons, let me just tell you about this show first. \n\n**Fan Context:** \n\nAs I’ve shown already, I am a huge fan of The Tallest Man On Earth. I have known his music since I was in high school, one of the last artists I remember having burned on a CD (my brother burned it for me, I wish I could say I was cool enough to know how to burn a CD). But, I didn't wrap myself in his music for very long, like I’ve done recently. I went away from him for years. I liked him, but didn’t feel the need to go deeper into his music. But I started listening to more of him over the last three years, and in the past year or so, I have held his music in such high regard. I said in [my first review of his show at the Strathmore Theatre in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/indie/comments/1jywsw8/show_thoughts_tallest_man_on_earth_headlining_at/) that I’ve recently found his music very calming, and it makes me crave nature. He’s so descriptive, he always seems to be around nature, and his overall sound grabs me so hard that I wonder about his life. Not just his lyrics, but his *sound* paints flashes of film in my mind of what I think he’s describing, but it’s not so direct. He makes me think very imaginatively, and there aren’t any other artists that have the same effect to the extent that he does. Recently, I’ve said that I think he’s the closest that anyone will ever come to making English sound like a romance language. And his guitar playing is so unique and creative, and just immensely impressive, there is no artist that compares to him in my mind. Anyways, enough with my fangirling.\n\n**The Show…** \n\nTMOE came on stage at 9:00, after The Stilltide came off at 8:41. A short wait between sets, which is great. \n\nHe walked onto the stage with that fully Swedish song of his playing in the background, I believe it’s “For Sent for Edelweiss,” but it’s a really distorted version, sounds very old, like it’s being played on vinyl. It’s cool though, I like it, and I wonder if there is actually a difference between the one they use on tour vs. the studio recording. \n\nMattson turned and looked really gratefully into the crowd, putting his hand over his heart. After a round of applause, he started by playing the violin (fiddle, in this case?). He played an intro with a bow first, then came up to the microphone and started picking it, playing it like a mandolin. Then he started singing a cover of “Moonshiner,” which I thought was a Bob Dylan cover, but later discovered that it’s a traditional folk song that’s been played by so many people, there is no known writer of it. It was a very cool way to start the show. It was so quiet in the room, and the picking of the violin strings was so faint, his voice expanded so powerfully over them. He really let it out on some lyrics, especially the build up to “I’ll go to… some HOLLOOOOWWW,” for example. He clearly loves this song, and he eventually said that it’s a traditional folk song “from where I’m from,” so I’ll have to do some digging there to see if he meant it’s from Sweden, or just Europe in general. Probably Europe, I’d guess. \n\nAnyways, I forget when he ended it, but I don’t think he got through the entire song. Thinking back, I love that as a way to start the show. A really bare intro before he starts playing guitar heavily for the next hour and a half. And his voice, it’s never been the prettiest, but when it’s standing mostly on its own like that it wakes your ears up at the very least, and introduces them to this singer. \n\nBefore starting the next song, he spoke for a minute or so, and I loved what he had to say. “Thank you so much for coming out tonight… this is exactly where I’m supposed to be, because it’s a luxury that I get to do this…” something along those lines. He talked about how no matter what’s happening in his life or in society, he thinks to himself about music: “Wait a minute, this is what it’s all about… we still do this, we’re still here… you’re my light \\[the audience\\].” He also said that that was the first time he played fiddle on stage just a moment ago for Moonshiner. And he talked about how jet lagged he was, too: “I am soooo jetlagged.” It was funny. \n\nThen Mattson started playing “A Lion’s Heart,” which was a pleasant surprise! I knew I recognized the riff, but it took me a moment to realize what song it was. Perhaps it took me a moment because he was playing it on electric, his big white guitar (I think a Les Paul?), and the studio recording is on acoustic and I’ve never heard it electric. It was stunning. It sounds so freaking good on electric, it’s awesome. The riff after the chorus, good lord. So many of his songs are given an extra feeling when played on electric guitar, much like “Love is All.” A Lion’s Heart is quietly one of the great TMOE songs I think, and one that I don’t speak enough about as one of my favorites. It was so pleasant to hear live, and the electric version was quite the gift. \n\nHe went into “Wind and Walls” next, I really liked the intro and he played it on a 12 string guitar. Super tingy sound. This was a song I recognized the name of, but I don’t think I ever listened to. Maybe I did, but just didn’t give it much of my attention. I was struck by the entrance to the chorus: “In all these riots of BROKEN sounds!” He belted that lyric out with screeching passion, which is almost a given, but I thought it was particularly attention-grabbing here, perhaps because I didn’t know the song. \n\nWithout stopping, Mattson went straight into another song, another one that I didn’t know. But I have since learned that it isn’t his. He flowed straight from the end of Wind and Walls into a cover of Blaze Foley’s “Rainbows and Ridges,” which was a really nice touch, it felt right. Like it was meant to be played as an outro to Wind and Walls. Two totally different songs, but the way he transitioned into Rainbows and Ridges made them feel naturally attached to each other.\n\nAfter this, Mattson gave a shoutout to The Stilltide, and made a joke about Anna formerly being his guitar tech, saying “she was my slave,” which got a laugh from the audience. It was funny, he then said, “I can’t joke about that,” in a tone that sounded like he was judging himself. \n\nI wrote down during this brief pause in the music while Mattson was talking: “The guy seems to struggle with his words when speaking. It's shocking, because he spews them out so confidently in song.” And I still feel that way. Many times he would start sentences and then stop a word or two into them, then restart, as if he was constantly rearranging his thoughts to make sure what he said came out how he wanted it to. That’s just my observation about him speaking. I will add, though, as I’ve mentioned, when the words do come out, I am really intrigued by what he has to say. I found his demeanor and way of speaking really interesting. He’s definitely a complex guy, but is not unrelatable. \n\nOne thing that stood out to me was that he said “Thank you for listening,” a handful of times after songs. And he said it with a tone and a facial expression that said “I’m being serious. Thank you for listening.” It’s a funny thing to say because people paid to come to a show to see him play, of course they’re going to listen, but yet he still says thank you specifically for that. I’m not saying this makes him a saint or something, almost all artists say “thank you,” but I do think it adds to the point about how genuine he is. Or maybe just how much he appreciates being able to do what he’s doing. \n\n“Every Little Heart” was after this. He plays a quality version of the song solo, of course, but this is one I’d like to hear with a full band. It’s a light song and doesn’t need a big punching sound, but I think it’s one in which the other instruments add an important backing to it. \n\nHe pulled out what I later learned was a fretless banjo next to play “Like the Wheel.” As I said, I didn’t like all of the different ways he played certain songs, and this version didn’t work for me. I think the slide guitar is so gorgeous in Like the Wheel. When I saw him the first time, it was my first time hearing the song and I thought it was stunning. It’s become one of my favorites of his, so I would have loved to hear it just as it is. BUT, it was cool to see him play an instrument you don’t see everyday, and the song was still enjoyable. Just not as much. From what I remember, he kept pretty much the same rhythm throughout the song, or at least the same strumming/picking pattern. It’s hard to describe the way he was playing this one. If you were there or have seen him play this at other shows, please add how you remember it. I just remember thinking it was a bit underwhelming, but I respect what he’s doing. He’s been playing a lot of these songs, especially that one, for a very long time, so I’d guess he’s trying to pull something new out of them, something that drives him more toward the song and makes him excited to play it. And, he shouldn't care what I want him to play, or what anyone wants him to play. \n\nThe fretless banjo had a really bouncy, wavy sound, a little hypnotic. It made a very distinct sound when he would shoot his hand up and down the (not so fret?) board. \n\nOnto a regular fretful banjo for the next song, he began by saying “This song is about Charlie Sheen,” which got a laugh. He continued, “But \\[it’s about\\] how he was on screen when I was six… I didn’t know he was going to be an asshole.” Something like that. It was funny, and I love that he sticks to that story because it’s true. Of course, the song was “Major League,” and his explanation is that he was in Cleveland when he was six years old and something about watching Major League made him want to be a baseball player. He went through this same story the first time I saw him, he said he actually played baseball in Sweden in his youth at some point. The more ya know. I could not picture TMOE playing baseball. Pretty funny. \n\nAlong this monologue, he also said “Movin’ up in the banjo world.” And he mentioned something about seeing Steve Martin play and John Hartford play. Speaking of which, if you got any John Hartford recs, let me know. Throw ‘em at me. I wanna get to know more of that guy’s music. \n\nAlso, in the middle of the song, if I remember correctly, he paused at one point. Not abruptly, but while he was strumming along and I think he got quieter and quieter and slower and slower, staring at somebody in the audience, then stopped and said, “I just got this app on my phone that turns off all the other apps, because I’m addicted to them, but it’s great I’m getting my life back…” something like that. I don’t know what led him to say that, perhaps someone was on their phone, but I don’t know. He didn’t sound annoyed, he just said that and then continued to the end of the song I believe. Please tell me if I'm off here if you were there, my memory on it is fuzzy and I’m going off of the brief notes that I wrote down. Anyways, I totally relate to the struggle of being addicted to your phone. We all are for the most part. It’s something that I think about a lot and want to change, so I loved to hear him mention that. Whether it was just a random thought or something he thinks a lot about too. Like I said, he’s complex, and weird, odd, but not unrelatable. \n\nHe did Henry Street next, and right before it he said, “I love you guys so much, here’s a song about New York.” \n\n“Love is All” was next. A vintage TMOE song, so excellent on electric. The picking sound is just so cool. He did a long intro into it that I remember from the first show, it was similar. He makes the guitar sound like it’s from space (as I’ve heard him describe the sound of Skip James playing guitar). Anyways, it was funny, during the song he went in front of the stage and squatted down low where almost no one could see him, then stood up and said “There are no monsters down there \\[below the stage\\]!” That got a laugh. \n\nHe went on perhaps his longest monologue before the next song. He talked about the “[Little Red Barn Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuB2HLAbiQw)” that he did in Sweden, which I’ve since come to learn more about and watched it. It’s awesome if you’re a fan, I highly recommend it. He mentioned that it’s his ex wife’s barn, and that they’re actually good friends now. He remembered a time when she asked him, “Could you just get a hobby that’s not music?” And that led him to start fly fishing again, which led him to find this fly fishing YouTube channel that another Swedish guy made. It was funny, he said, “...and it was early-internet, so everything was *fun,”* clearly hinting at how the internet is not very fun now, which I think most people can agree with. Just another example of him showing a bit more of his personality, and how he views things in the world. Anyways, he found a video on this channel that had “The Dreamer” playing in the background. So Mattson emailed the guy who ran the channel, thanking him for using the song. The guy then called Mattson: “He was like, ‘Dude, are you gonna sue me?’” Mattson said. Apparently the guy was paranoid about using his song illegally, it was funny. Long story short, they became friends after that, and their friendship began right around the same time that this guy (sorry, I don’t remember his name) was dating this new girl. After explaining all of that, Mattson said, “They got married this year… This song is about the gravel road where they live.” I can’t seem to find this song, which makes me think it may not have been studio released, but I remember the lyric “gravel road of time.” If I’m missing something here, somebody let me know. Because I remember liking the song, but I can’t find it anywhere! \n\nOne more note on this story, I believe it was during this monologue when talking about his ex-wife asking him about finding a hobby outside of music, he said “Because it’s my passion… and my sickness.” I thought that was a great explanation for something you love so much, that you have to have in your life, so much so that it hurts you too. “It’s my passion and my sickness.” Man, what a thing to say. What a way to explain his love for music and his need to have it as a part of his life, his need to perform, his need to share his art.  \n\n“Burden of Tomorrow” was next, which was another pleasant surprise. I had actually been listening to it for the first time in a while just a day or two before the show, and was thinking that I don’t give the song enough credit. He told a funny story before playing it, about how he wrote the song while living with someone who really hated him playing guitar. So he would have to go into another room and play very quietly at night. \n\nNext, Mattson invited Anna from The Stilltide out on stage to sing “The Dreamer,” together. He introduced her by saying, “There’s a better guitar player in the building,” something like that. A very nice compliment. \n\nI’ve seen videos of them singing this song together before this, and if you’ve seen them, this rendition was similar to most of those. Anna played guitar and they alternated the verses I’m pretty sure, but both sang the chorus together. They sang well together, but they got really quiet in the chorus, making it become a very gentle song, and it’s not quite as uplifting as the way the song usually is, and it’s not as enjoyable in my opinion. I mean, they’re great. Anna is a wonderful singer. And I know they’re just having a good time. But I like to be honest with my opinion, especially when it comes to how much I actually enjoyed a song live, even if it is one of my favorites. Anyways, it’s funny seeing Mattson without a guitar in his hand, it’s as if he doesn’t really know what to do with himself. In the beginning, he was laying on the ground behind her, not doing anything in particular that I could see, just being a goof. It was funny. They clearly love each other as friends. My girlfriend said, “It’s almost like they don’t spend every day together,” which was a good point. They never really get tired of playing this song together. They were messing around for a lot of the song, laughing through some of it. I’m happy they’re happy! I just love the guitar in that song and the lyrics, and neither were as prominent in this version.\n\nHe played “Rivers,” next. Great song. Went well. \n\nI believe Mattson then said that he was “going to play a cover,” but forgot the lyrics or something? I remember him saying “...next time.” It wasn’t a “start the song, then stop” situation, at least I don’t think so. I just remember him saying something about not being able to play a song and then saying “next time.” My memory is fuzzy on this. If you were there, please share if you remember what happened here. \n\nHe played “Revelation Blues,” next, just an excellent song. The guitar riff is so cool live, that sound and tuning is out of this world. And he played an amazing outro. A classic TMOE song, one of the best of the set, and I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s been true at all of his shows. Except I will say, having been at another show of his, I enjoyed it more this time than the first time. I was closer to the stage, and overall I think it just struck me more. \n\nMattson made a mention of the first time he did NPR Tiny Desk here in D.C. before playing the next song, I believe it was after he said a couple of nice things about the area. It was funny, he talked about how awkward it was with all the people in that small room looking at him, and basically said they didn’t give him much information/direction, and he was confused and nervous. He said sarcastically, “They were like, ‘Yeah you’re gonna go play in there… The acoustics sucks!’” That got some laughs. I wonder what all the artists who do Tiny Desk think of it, and what the whole experience is like. \n\n“I Won’t Be Found” was next. Not my favorite of his songs, not one I listen to much, but nonetheless a good song. It went well. Then, at the end, he didn’t stop playing guitar. He intro’d straight into “The Gardener,” screaming “OOOOOOOHHHH!” when he took a brief pause (or a “rest” would be the proper musical term?) just before switching strumming patterns. It was a really cool moment. Like he slowed down a little just to switch gears to something a little more energetic, and one of his best, most quintessential songs. \n\nThat closed out the set, then Mattson came back out for an encore. Didn’t take long for him to come back out. He played “King of Spain” on the fretless banjo, and I already explained how I felt about the instrument. It’s cool, really cool, but I didn’t think it added much to the song, or made it better, or created a good alternate version. It was still enjoyable. I actually wish I could hear it again, but still, it wasn’t my favorite. \n\nHis last story of the night came after this, when he told about how he got the fretless banjo. Basically, a friend of his in Sweden makes them, and he makes them using salad bowls that he gets at a market. So Mattson said, “I always look at this and wonder, ‘What food has been in here?’” It was funny. \n\nThen, he actually closed with a cover. It was “Tomorrow is a Long Time,” by Bob Dylan. It was good! I’m not a huge fan of playing a ton of covers, but I think they’re more acceptable for a band/artist who has a lot of music and has been around for a while. It’s cool to hear them do something different and get a glimpse and the music they like and their influences. And three covers isn’t “a lot” in an 18-song setlist, so, I didn’t mind them here and thought Tomorrow is a Long Time was a cool way to go out. \n\nOverall, this was a great show. But it was a very unique one for me, in which my attention and take away wasn’t completely focused on the music. I left the show with the music in the back of my head, of course, but somewhere near the front of my brain were the things that Mattson said. I felt I learned a little bit about him, his personality. Some more than I already knew. I mean, as much as one can through the lens of a performance and through some comments and some longer stories here and there. I’m not saying I know the guy, but I got a larger glimpse into his persona and how he views things in the world. \n\nAnyways, speaking on the music, it was excellent. The Tallest Man On Earth is one of the best performers you can find in music. He is so unique, and is a powerful artist to watch live. Go see him. \n\nIf you were at this show, or have seen The Tallest Man On Earth on this tour or at any time, please add your perspective in the replies. Tell me I’m dead wrong, tell me I’m right. Tell me I’m slightly off. Tell me something about The Tallest Man on Earth and I’ll be happy.\n\n**\\*One side note\\***\n\nHe was a bit goofy all night, which I know to be his personality, but it was interesting, I actually ran into the woman who was at the merch stand for TMOE the next day, because she was at the Real Estate show at The Lincoln Theatre. She mentioned to me that she thought he may have been drunk. He doesn’t strike me as a big drinker, but what do I know? He had something on stage that looked like it could’ve been beer, but that didn’t make me think he was drunk. I don’t think he was, but she made a good point. He was a bit loopier than probably usual, but he was also super jet lagged. If you were there, let me know what you think. \n\n**\\*A quick nod to the opener\\***\n\nThe Still Tide are a very cool band and a worthy opener. There songs lack a certain punch in my opinion, they’re very soft, but it’s good music and unique music. They’re just a two-piece, and the synth that they use is certainly like nothing you’ve seen before. They’ve briefly explained how it was made in the two shows I’ve seen them. It’s cool. The Stilltide is definitely worth showing up a little early for to catch a couple songs of their set. They started at 8pm, and ended at 8:41. \n\n**\\*Notes on the Venue\\***\n\nThe 9:30 Club is one of, if not *the* best venue in D.C. I’ve been to a good number of shows there over the last six months, and to me, it’s the perfect size (fills 1,200). I’ve never had any complaints about the sound there either. \n\nIt’s become my favorite venue in D.C. For a GA ticket to get you a great look from pretty much anywhere, and there’s an upper level. I personally almost always think the floor area is better for a show, but it is a great view from up there, you’re just pushing your luck on being able to hold a spot up on the balcony, depending on how big of a group you have and how early you get there. A lot more room to maneuver in the GA area. \n\nBars on both sides of the GA area, a cool record/CD room in the top right corner of the GA area, bathrooms very close by and don’t fill up very easily, and it’s easy to get to in D.C. It looks like there’s a “back bar” that you go down a stairwell to, I think it’s on your left as you walk in. I’ve never been down there, but would love to check that out. Let me know if you know what I’m talking about and have been down there. \n\n12 freakin’ dollars for a 12 ounce beer, though. That seems to be the unfortunate cherry on top of any venue anywhere. It was an IPA, I think it’s under 10 bucks for a light beer there. I’ll give them that. \n\nAnyways, go see a show at The 9:30 Club, a staple D.C. venue for good reason.",

The song was initially intended to just remain an album cut, however, when Lynn Anderson's version, released in mid-1973, was a success, the duo was upset that they hadn't released their version as a single to begin with.[5] The Carpenters' version was later released as a single on September 17, 1973. Karen Carpenter re-recorded her lead vocal for the single release as she was not quite satisfied with the original. The new version appeared on the duo's first compilation album, The Singles: 1969-1973.” (Wikipedia)",

Since I don’t remember anything about them, it’s probably a shot in the dark, but maybe someone here will know what im talking about. An anti-folk style artist i listened to a lot in like 2016, I think they were only on YouTube? Didn’t really have any videos, just black background lyric videoes. The usual acoustic guitar, almost monotone rough singing, the Moldy Peaches kinda vibe. As far as I remember their song titles were a little long and often didn’t have anything to do with the lyrics. I think one of their songs might have had a title that started with something like “i dont know” but im not sure? \n\nI realise I could be describing hundreds of different small YouTube singer songwriters right now, but if it rings a bell for anyone at all, please let me know!",

Along with having some great recordings, the sequencing of the Anthology is utterly masterful.  I've finished writing about the first volume, and this piece examines the sequencing, and provides an overview of the connections between the songs on Volume One.",

The arrangement is very simple, only a classical and an electrical guitar. Hope you will like it!",

The project started a few years back with some basic bluegrass-forward melodies I had floating around in my head but when it came time to put them down, they seemed to want to take their time and envelope over time. My primary instrument on this record is Dobro and I find that exploring these ideas on the dobro really lent to a slowing down of them and creating gradients between strong melody-forward tunes into large soundscapes.  \n  \nFor the record I employed the help and talent of some of Montreal’s top bluegrass players and really explained the concept both thematically and musically and I was so happy that they understood the assignment. I also employed some analog synths in here but for the most part I am using recorded voice or sounds that were heavily modulated or plugins.\n\nThematically, there are musical themes that reoccur throughout the album. For the most part they are very simplistic in nature and tend to be around major and happy sounding chords. The reason for this is because the lyrical themes and messaging of the album are truly about the things that matter. Friendship, true love for ourselves and others, the letting go of ego-driven motivations and remembering who and what matters to us. Cheesy I know but it was something I was feeling at the time and felt that the only way to express this was to really lean into it.\n\nAnyway…The project is Ocre and the album is Magnanimity. Available where ever you listen to music…. The album is meant to be heard as a whole and I hope you get a chance to do so. Enjoy! \n\n Love you all.",

    "content": "On 12.9.2019 my father passed away from a Heartattack. Exactly one month before my kid was born.  \nI went to live in another country and was about 2 year without seeing my father personally. He was suppoused to arrive 1 week before the birth of my boy, unfortunately he passed away. I've made alot of plans, things we were suppoused to do together and was so glad that he would be there with me when i turn into a Father myself. That crushed me.... I was empty for 2 years. My son was the light that gave me strength by the time... Even tought i knew he wasn't to blame for that, i was mad (i cannot explain). I've wrote this song to tell him that its not his fault and to release the words i was keeping inside for that long.  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2llmrszCGUI&amp;list=OLAK5uy\\_mrVQyG-4gbCLCrrClRCUFO4w2R0UoSl7k&amp;index=14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2llmrszCGUI&amp;list=OLAK5uy_mrVQyG-4gbCLCrrClRCUFO4w2R0UoSl7k&amp;index=14)\n\nI'm not a professional writer and my english is not perfect, but i hope you guys enjoy it.",

    "content": "I was in a sauna at a folk festival in Oregon this summer and heard the most haunting and enchanting song sung by two young folks. I've tried to Google what I can recall of the lyrics but I can't find anything. Someone else in the sauna asked what song it was and they replied, \"Some ancient English song or something - we learned it at a different singing group.\"\n\nHere's what I remember:\n\n\\-It was a very haunting, like spooky, lilting 4/4 song. Minor key.\n\n\\-It was full of natural themes, kind of like someone was dialoguing with nature/the fae or something.\n\n\\-There was this constant refrain about \"mushrooms and clover,\" something like \"for what do you hunger? I hunger for mushrooms and clover\" or something like that.\n\n\\-There was this very unique chromatic descending melodic phrase, like \"C B Bb A Ab G rest-of-the-line\" that frequently appeared in the song.\n\nThat's all I got. If anyone can find a recording or video or something I'd be super grateful as I'd love to learn it with my sweetheart too.",

If this gets some responses, I’m sure folks will post some in the comments.\n\nHe has stated the inspiration stems from a conversation where a woman told him “I’ve met some rough Johns” in response to his name. I have repeatedly heard this as a rebut to my interpretation, but I think he either failed to understand that woman’s meaning (she may have been a prostitute or was making a joke) or he is playing coy. \n\nI made this post because I’m shocked by how hot of a take this was among my friend group. \n\nWhat do yall think, am i crazy?",

    "content": "Curious about this guy and wondering if anyone can identify him for me, so I can check out more of his music. Here's the story behind the picture:\n\nPulled off the Blue Ridge Parkway about a week ago to have a little picnic and give my 3 and 6 year olds their first good look at a mountain vista.\n\nCouple minutes later, this kid parks his car next to ours, pulls out a red guitar, and starts to sing and play some covers. Dylan, at first. Then The Stones.\n\nAnd he's good. Like, really good. His voice the perfect blend of glass and gravel.\n\nSo we sit there in the hatchback of our car, watching the blue haze of the far off mountain-cut sky, listening to classic songs, artfully remembered.\n\nMy wife starts to sing along softly, harmonizing a bit with that smoky voice of hers until our daughter asks her to stop because she's listening.\n\nAnd it's a perfect, precious, beautiful moment and it's ours, and now a little bit yours, too.\n\nBut we're a long way from home and it's time to go, so we pack up our kids and our stuff as the man plays on.\n\nHe finishes a song and I thank him for it and for the rest and tell him my son says he's a rock star.\n\nHe laughs and says thanks, and I ask him if he's headed to the next show.\n\n\"I hope so,\" he says, and I hope so, too.\n\nI hope it's a good one.\n\n- - -\n\nNote: it's for sure not Jesse Welles - too young, and his hair was too short.",

I couldn't tell if it was affected/quirky or involuntary. He seemed a little out of step and it was hard to tell if he's an asshole or a little confused",

Been doing this for almost 10 years now.\n\nWe recently recorded an album of Shanties. Its by no means professional, but we think its a very honest attempt to do these songs justice without making it about our personality. Shanties speak for themselves. And there is something about them that makes you want to sing your loudest even when you are living in a land locked city in the desert, recording music in an industrial complex with commercial jets roaring overhead. \n\nHere is a video of one of the songs \"Leave Her Johnny\". I'll share the full album when its live:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fov0kcdQR64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fov0kcdQR64)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i3a17jn7ctpf1.png?width=1724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=342c8c7318dcf6a9d8f09d08921030447868d0e3",

When I focused on the lyrics I had always let drift past me, the song also revealed a whole other dimension: pure poetry, yes, but also reflections on being in the world, the censorship of freedoms, and even a form of solidarity...” \n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Scar is a clone-based anti-hero who embodies both discipline and chaos. He’s engineered to serve on impossible missions, carrying self-destruct devices to ensure no DNA remains after his work is done. His identity is wrapped in secrecy and fatalism: every Scar knows he will be erased once his replacement is ready. This cycle gives him an aura of inevitability, making his presence feel more like a force of nature than a single man. His missions are executed with surgical brutality—he infiltrates, detonates, and eradicates, leaving behind nothing but silence and corpses.\n\nWhat makes Scar unique is the philosophy driving his violence. He isn’t a mercenary or a soldier of fortune; his killings are framed as divine obligation. A chemist and junky at once, he creates drug cocktails tailored to heighten his performance, injecting adrenaline and dopamine agonists with heroin to maintain absolute focus. His missions are fueled by this combination of chemical precision and unwavering faith that he is carrying out God’s will. The result is a figure who is at once terrifyingly methodical and completely unhinged, a weaponized zealot moving through shadows.\n\nScar’s mythos deepens with his silent, mythic retaliation against the global elite. In his “genetic failure retaliation arc,” he seeds hidden flaws in the bloodlines of rulers—wealthy Americans, Russians, Chinese, and others—so they die suddenly and fatally, as though struck by destiny itself. No bombs, no armies, just an unseen decay that looks like natural disease but is in truth Scar’s vengeance. This turns him into more than a man or even a weapon—he becomes a story, a whisper of fate that stalks empires. Scar isn’t just feared for what he does, but for what he represents: inevitability.",

    "content": "(Berwyn, PA) On Saturday, September 20th, at 7 p.m., Trinity Presbyterian Church's Spotlight Concert Series presents an unforgettable evening of beautiful music as the critically acclaimed “Harmonic Alternative Folk” duo Flagship Romance take the stage.\n\nFlagship Romance is known for their breathtaking vocal harmonies, inspired songwriting, dynamic live show, and a remarkable on and off-stage chemistry that will leave you with the feeling that you made two new best friends. Married singers-songwriters Shawn Fisher and Jordyn Jackson effortlessly fuse technical precision in their impeccably tight vocal blend with an invigorating sense of emotional abandon in their energetic live persona. Performing each show as if it could be their last, this duo will have you questioning how their larger-than-life sound can come from just two voices and an acoustic guitar.\n\nTraveling over 200,000 miles since their musical inception, the duo has amassed an engaged grassroots following. A testament to Fisher and Jackson’s close relationship with their supporters, Flagship Romance has released four critically acclaimed full-length albums, 100% funded by their enthusiastic fanbase. To date, their multiple crowdfunding efforts, including the duo’s most recent campaign for their recently released self-titled double album, have raised a combined total of over $175,000. Currently based in Louisville, KY, Flagship Romance has begun releasing a consistent string of singles from the double album, produced by GRAMMY award winning producer Lee Miles.\n\nIn today’s music market, where more and more avid listeners are clamoring for something honest and real, Flagship Romance plans to take that honesty, chemistry, and “real-ness” to new heights.\n\nThe doors will open at 6:30 PM and the concert will begin at 7 PM. There is no charge for admission, but a free-will donation is suggested.\n\nTrinity Presbyterian Church is located on Berwyn Avenue, one block south of Route 30 (Lancaster Pike) in Berwyn, PA. Parking is free. The GPS address for the main church parking lot is 51 Waterloo Ave, Berwyn, PA 19312. The church is also one block from the Berwyn train station (Septa's Paoli-Thorndale line).",

    "title": "Cat Vicenç, la veu renaixuda del folk català",
    "content": "Nascut a Barcelona el 22 de maig de 1963, Vicenç Pardo Meseguer, conegut artísticament com Cat Vicenç, és un d’aquells cantautors que han viscut diverses vides dins la música. Criat a Sant Just Desvern, ja de ben jove va sentir l’impuls de compondre i compartir cançons. Amb amics de l’institut va fundar Trapo, una banda de rock simfònic que li va obrir les portes de l’escena musical emergent de finals dels setanta.\n\nAls anys vuitanta, quan el panorama barceloní bullia entre punk i rock urbà, Vicenç va assumir la veu i la guitarra a Oficial Matute, un projecte que recollia l’esperit transgressor de La Banda Trapera del Río. Era una època de passió i excés, però també de recerca personal. Finalment, els camins de la vida el van portar a allunyar-se de la música, deixant enrere escenaris i estudis durant dècades.\n\nEl retorn no va arribar fins al 2017, quan coneix el guitarrista i professor Fernando Mercedes. Entre tots dos neix una amistat i un projecte compartit: Nando &amp; Vicenç, un duet on la fusió de folk i rock pren un protagonisme renovat. D’aquesta etapa sorgiria el missatge pacifista del seu primer màxi/single “Make Music Not War” (2023).\n\nPerò la identitat de Cat Vicenç es desplega sobretot en el terreny del folk d’autor. Amb sensibilitat i maduresa, el músic ha tornat a escriure des de la vivència, la memòria i la mirada crítica sobre el món que l’envolta. L’any 2023 es va atrevir amb un repte singular: un tribut a Cat Stevens en català, demostrant la seva capacitat d’adaptar clàssics universals a la llengua pròpia amb una gran delicadesa.\n\nEl 2025 ha significat un pas més en ferm: la publicació del single “Un Poble Oblidat”, una cançó que recull l’essència del seu estil actual—poètic, intimista i compromès—i que el situa en la nova escena del folk català.\n\nAvui, des de Viladecans (Baix Llobregat), Cat Vicenç continua explorant la seva veu, més lliure que mai, després d’un llarg viatge vital. El seu camí musical és la història d’un renaixement: el d’un cantautor que, després de silenciar-se durant anys, ha tornat per deixar testimoni de la seva experiència i emoció a través de la música.\n\n\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/7H0j9TPzpl6s55BxuicXl2?si=_BwYyv8tTwqGP34z8logEQ",

    "content": "# [Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7e0TSOqTFm7OYnxWcAA98Q?si=DADpteU_RWmoIGSF1qMfAA)\n\nI’ve been curating a playlist that gathers together some of my favorite mystic folk, pagan ambient, Slavic and Nordic-inspired sounds. It’s a journey through fairy tales, myths and forgotten realms, perfect for writing, meditation, or just escaping into another world for a while.\n\nYou’ll find artists like **Sowulo, Rúnahild, Trobar de Morte, The Moon &amp; The Nightspirit, Emian**, and also some Slavic-inspired projects (including my own music project **Cishynia Uspaminau**).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oi24ot9strnf1.png?width=1427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55b59fb25eaac8aa6f5685df83157a3a96d93565",

It was recorded in one afternoon in London by Paul Simmon.\n\nJackson was born in buffalo new York in 1943 and lived one of the saddest and tragic life's in music history. When he was 11 he was involved in an elementary school fire which killed 15 classmates, this left him covered in burns with months of recovery and a lifetime of PTSD. A teacher gave him a guitar to help him and he ended up playing it for the rest of his life.\n \nAfter an insurance payout Jackson moved to London for the folk book where he recorded his first and only album. While there he fell in love and married his wife, the marriage failed after their only child died from cystic fibrosis. After this his mental health spiralled worse and he went back to new York. \n\nWhile in new York he walked down the street with a bb gun which police mistook for a real firearm, resulting in him getting shot in the face and loosing sight in his eyes. Jackson then spiralled into schizophrenia and alcoholism before his death in 1999 from pneumonia.\n\nFollow my instagram @whats.he.spinnin for more information on other albums on my collection",

The playlist is all about new Folk music and upcoming new Folk artists.\n\nI started the playlist out of frustration with the Spotify algorithm, which kept serving me more of the same. Furthermore, many popular Folk-inspired playlists are (partially) owned by major labels who only include their own signings, which drastically limits the selection.\n\nFor my *Indie Folk Boutique* playlist the selections are based on love for the music, not contractual obligations or marketing purposes. I scour the internet for hours every week to find new releases and hidden gems. No algorithms, just pure handpicked discovery. You’d be surprised how much good music you can find off the radar!\n\nI also include household (Indie) Folk artists like Bon Iver, Sufjan Stevens, The Lumineers, Paper Kites etc. but first and foremost the playlist is meant as a platform for new and lesser-known artists to be discovered. \n\nYou can find the playlist here:\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Cwvhff570yGShclzqQVe5?si=79264fb5d06748c8](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4Cwvhff570yGShclzqQVe5?si=79264fb5d06748c8)\n\nI hope that you enjoy the playlist and may you discover some good new music in there!",

Depressed but not depressing is one way to explain it I suppose, sort of melancholic. I feel like most of it is folk adjacent at least and I figured this sub would know best.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have a playlist which right now has these songs:\n\n    Cannock Chase - Labi Siffre\n    \n    Daisy Lady - Tír na nÓg\n    \n    Fool Me a Good Night - Labi Siffre\n    \n    It Must Be Love - Labi Siffre\n    \n    Blue Lady - Labi Siffre\n    \n    'Till Forever - Labi Siffre\n    \n    Pink Moon - Nick Drake\n    \n    Place To Be - Nick Drake\n    \n    zombie girl - Adrianne Lenker\n    \n    Behind That Locked Door - George Harrison\n    \n    Beware of Darkness - George Harrison\n    \n    I Got a Name - Jim Croce\n    \n    April Come She Will - Simon &amp; Garfunkel\n    \n    Mother Nature's Son - The Beatles\n    \n    two reverse - Adrianne Lenker\n    \n    my angel - Adrianne Lenker\n    \n    dragon eyes - Adrianne Lenker\n    \n    Snowqueen Of Texas - The Mamas &amp; The Papas\n    \n    Landslide - Fleetwood Mac\n\nHope someone'll understand what I'm looking for here even if I maybe didn't explain it that well.",

    "content": "I’m John. I’ve been writing lyrics for three decades. At 16, I started a strange ritual: sealing words in bottles and throwing them into the ocean, hoping the right line might find the right person. Later, I tucked many of those words away online under “John From Work.”\n\nI’m done hiding.\n\nI’m releasing songs built from those old lyrics with a simple idea: same words, different genres. A confession that sprints as punk‑folk can also breathe as a quiet folk ballad, an alt‑country hymn, or a beat‑driven cut. The emotional core stays; the clothes change.\n\nA big part of why I’m sharing now: I’m a dad to two profoundly autistic kids who aren’t able to communicate what’s inside the way the world expects. Loving them re‑tuned my ears to the unsaid. It pushed me to stop waiting for perfect and start telling the truth out loud.\n\nWhat’s live and what’s next:\n\nFolk‑punk versions are live now (lyric‑forward, shout‑along choruses)\nEmo cuts are on deck\nNashville sessions are coming in September\n\n\nI’d love honest listens and blunt feedback. Add what moves you, ignore what doesn’t. Thanks for making space for new voices.",

We loved Tim Erikson's version of this song, but also Joan Baez's and a few versions we've heard played by others live - we kind of derived our own version from those.\n\nWe recorded it in a very simple way (just two mics in Rachel's back room) to keep it close to how it feels when we play live - although we have to confess we overdubbed the bass. If you’d like to have a listen, here it is: [https://theoldcrowroad.bandcamp.com/track/i-wish-the-wars-were-all-over](https://theoldcrowroad.bandcamp.com/track/i-wish-the-wars-were-all-over)\n\nWe’d genuinely love to know what you think, especially if you know other versions of this song - we’re always interested in the way these songs travel and change.\n\nThanks for taking the time, and if you've recorded a version then please share yours – we’d love to hear it!",

Any feedback is welcome.\n\nI saw you in the orchard where the rotten apples lie,\nYour hands were full of butterflies and gold rained from the sky,\nThey live just for a moment but they dream a thousand years \nYou let them go like ashes while the sunset dried our tears\n\nButterflies don’t sing my love, they whisper in the trees,\nThey dance on bones and broken dreams blown in on the breeze\nThey paint their wings with sorrow,\nThey drink the dusk and die\nButterflies don’t sing my love, the only float and lie\n\nYou kept a jar of monarchs on the window sill all june,\nAnd watched them turn to ghosts beneath the silver sickle moon\nI asked if you could hear them, those tiny paper screams\nYou smiled and plucked their shadows from the corners of your dreams\n\nButterflies don’t sing my love they hum a deep blue sound,\nIn graveyards full of violets, where the dead are tightly bound,\nThey rise at dusk like embers and fall like frozen rain\nButterflies don’t sing my love, but they remember pain\n\nBridge\nAnd sometimes in the morning light,\nI see them in the air,\nLike promises never kept,\nA million desperate prayers \n\nButterflies don’t sing my love\nBut I love them all the same,\nAnd in my darkest hour, they offer guiding flame\nI see them in the mirror, they caress me like the rain\nButterflies don’t sing my love \nLet’s fly with them again",

    "title": "Il canto degli sposi (Lu Mariulì + Mara Maje)",
    "content": "Questo brano è stato registrato insieme a Nicole Massanisso; è stato impreziosito da un video animato, ed è pronto per venire fuori. Ho messo insieme due canzoni della tradizione popolare di due regioni diverse: “Lu Mariulì” di San Giovanni Rotondo, in Puglia, il mio paese natale e “Mara Maje”, una canzone famosissima dell’Abruzzo, dove adesso si trova la mia casa. Ho scelto il titolo “Il canto degli sposi” perché il brano è composto da due canti legati al matrimonio. In “Lu Mariulì”, cantata al mio paese alle serenate, si possono trovare tutte le fasi dell’amore: dall’innamoramento “ma come e tè bella figghjola / j non l’aje petuta truvà” alla morte “nennèlla mia, jè fatte notte / iame allu lètte a repusà”; “Mara Maje” è lo straziante lamento di una vedova. Il video realizzato da Cristina Chiarilli racconta una storia. Siamo negli ultimissimi anni della transumanza, appena prima del mondo contemporaneo. Due giovani si innamorano, si sposano; subito dopo lui parte pastore e non fa più ritorno. Durante il lutto lei, abruzzese, ricorda il canto che lui, pugliese, le aveva cantato e piano piano lo fa suo, fino a ritrovare la pace e rincorrere la speranza. Può sembrare una storia triste. Occorre però non dimenticare che la malinconia, la nostalgia, la tradizione non sono sinonimo di tristezza ma ci riconducono al nostro presente e ci fanno ricostruire il nostro futuro. \n\nCrediti: \n\nVoci: Nicole Massanisso e Riccardo Santarelli \n\nChitarra: Riccardo Santarelli \n\nMix e mastering: Daniel Montecolle \n\nDisegni e video: Cristina Chiarilli\n\n  \nThis song has been recorded together with Nicole Massanisso: it has been embellished by an animated music video, and it's ready to come out. I have put together two traditional songs from two different regions of Italy: \"Lu Mariulì\", from san Giovanni Rotondo, Puglia, my birthplace and \"Mara Maje\", a very famous song from Abruzzo, where I live now. I have chosen the title \"Il canto degli sposi\" \\[The Song of the Newlyweds\\] because the song is made of two chants tied to marriage. \"Lu Mariulì\" is sung at serenades, and traces the phases of love: from falling in love (\"ma come e tè bella figghjiola / j non l'aje petuta truvà\" \\[but one like thee, sweet girl / I couldn't ever find\\]) to the death together \"nennèlla mia, jè fatte notte / iame allu lètte a repusà\" \\[my little one, it is really night / let's go to bed to rest\\]; \"Mara Maje\" is the heartbreaking lament of a widow. The video realized by Cristina Chiarilli tells a story. We are in the very last years of transhumance in Italy, just before the contemporary world. A young boy and a young girl fall in love, they get married; soon he leaves to be a shepherd and never returns. During the mourning she, a girl from Abruzzo, remembers the song that he, a boy from Puglia, sang to her and slowly she makes it hers, until she founds peace and she gets again hope. It may seem a sad story. We have not to forget though that melancholy, nostalgia, tradition are not synonyms of sadness but they lead us back to our present and they made us rebuild our future.\n\n  \nCredits: \n\nVoices: Nicole Massanisso e Riccardo Santarelli \n\nGuitar: Riccardo Santarelli \n\nMix and mastering: Daniel Montecolle \n\nDrawings and video: Cristina Chiarilli",

The only thing really holding me onto spotify is the opportunity to hear new music and artists I wouldn't ussually listen to or find. \n\n  \nOf course when I come across artists like this I buy their albums etc as I'm very aware that they Spotify isn't the best payers per streams. \n\n  \nDoes anyone have any good ideas on how to find artists etc that aren't on spotify?\n\n  \nLike even now word of mouth really leads to people sending song links on spotify - Ideally I would like to get away from this platform altogehter",

    "title": "Best Album Idea of these four???",
    "content": "---\n\nA. Iron &amp; Wine and Z Berg\n\n→ “Trapeze Swinger” meets “Bad List”\n\nEmotional Range: Sweeping grief, poetic yearning, personal regret.\n\nSound: Lo-fi elegance, sparse acoustics, layered soft harmonies.\n\nPotential Album: A memoir in slow motion. Full of love letters that were never sent, quiet evenings, and bittersweet memory.\n\nVerdict: Heartbreaking and beautiful. Easily the most narrative-rich pairing. Z Berg adds a feminine, bruised elegance to Beam’s rambling nostalgia.\n\nBest For: Fans of tear-stained letters, long walks at dusk, grief soaked in romance.\n\nCeiling: High. Think: a companion piece to Sufjan’s “Carrie &amp; Lowell.”\n\nWeakness: Might feel too heavy or emotionally uniform across 10–12 tracks.\n\n\n\n---\n\nB. Ryan Ross and Gregory Alan Isakov\n\n→ “Behind the Sea (Alt)” meets “Big Black Car”\n\nEmotional Range: Dreamy, melancholic, starry-eyed escape.\n\nSound: Gentle indie-folk with orchestral flourishes, surrealist lyrics.\n\nPotential Album: A dusty, magical realist road trip. Picture postcards, hallucinated lovers, faded circus tents.\n\nVerdict: Otherworldly. Ross brings quirky grandeur, Isakov brings grounded soul. The result? A quietly shimmering album of poetic riddles.\n\nBest For: Listeners who want to feel like they’re reading a weathered fairytale under starlight.\n\nCeiling: Extremely high for lyrical beauty and mood.\n\nWeakness: Risks being too subtle or emotionally distant for some.\n\n\n\n---\n\nC. Jesca Hoop and Robin Pecknold\n\n→ “One Way to Pray” meets “Featherweight”\n\nEmotional Range: Sacred, mysterious, emotionally elusive.\n\nSound: Chamber-folk, complex harmonies, ancient and modern at once.\n\nPotential Album: An elegy for forgotten gods. Built on cryptic metaphors, haunting arrangements, and choral undercurrents.\n\nVerdict: Ethereal masterpiece. This is the most artistically challenging and musically layered option.\n\nBest For: Listeners who like albums that reveal themselves slowly, after 3–5 listens.\n\nCeiling: Incredible. Would draw comparisons to Björk’s “Vespertine” or Radiohead’s “A Moon Shaped Pool.”\n\nWeakness: Not accessible. Might alienate casual listeners.\n\n\n\n---\n\nD. Bon Iver and Dan Auerbach\n\n→ “Wash.” meets “When The Night Comes”\n\nEmotional Range: Woozy romance, sorrowful cool.\n\nSound: Falsetto electronica meets smoky blues rock.\n\nPotential Album: A nocturnal fever dream. Neon-lit soul wrapped in digital fog, whispered heartbreak with guitar twang.\n\nVerdict: Sultry and shape-shifting. If they meet in the middle, this is a sleeper classic—sexy, sad, slow-burning.\n\nBest For: Moonlit drives, hazy summer heartbreaks, sonic texture lovers.\n\nCeiling: Moderately high depending on how well their tones merge.\n\nWeakness: Could feel uneven if the blend isn’t dialed in.",

He was allowed to pass a hat and sell CDs (I bought one)\n\nSo he came out and sang \"Gasoline and Coffee\" it blew me away at the time. \n\nThe album was \"Dumpster Diving Across America\" and he was in the process of doing exactly that. He and his cat, were driving around the country, playing small venues and open-mics, selling CDs, and subsisting at least in part, by dumpster diving. \n\nThe lyrics are very left leaning \\ green \\ socialist, but I can and still do sing along with the whole album. I like his melodies and guitar playing a lot.\n\nIt is not on Spotify unfortunately, or anywhere else that I can find, I think I found a picture of the CD cover online once.  \n\nSomehow a friend of a friend of a friend had a connection with him, and he came to my shared apartment to hang out, I think he slept in his truck in the driveway that night maybe, it's a bit hazy.",

    "content": "\"I Couldn't Help\"\n\nJust last week, one of Breonna Taylor's killers was finally sentenced. He received 33 months in prison, a sentence much shorter than the maximum allowed by law, but still more than the 1 day sentencing recommended by our current administration. And there are still other officers with open cases, and then others who were never charged at all. This isn't justice.\n\n\"I Couldn't Help\" is a song I wrote in August 2020 about racial injustice and police brutality in America. With the recent verdict in the Breonna Taylor case, now seemed like a good time to re-record it.",

For some reason, most of the reporting on this situation leaves out the officer’s name. His name is Elijah Helsley, and he’s a police officer in Clarksburg, WV. He has been placed on leave pending an investigation, but the fact that his name is already being obscured doesn’t inspire confidence in me that Officer Helsley will be held accountable for his actions.",

First one I heard was 'Farewell Johnny Miner' (anthemic song about industrial decline) and I can't get enough of 'Sally Wheatley' and 'Bonny Gateshead Lass' (both written over 150 years ago but amazingly fresh sounding). There are a bunch of great videos of his performances on the Youtube, usually starting with a humorous anecdote about the song's history. His guitar playing and vocal control is up there with the very best, and he chooses great songs that might not be associated with his region, but justifies it through making them his own ('Galway Shawl' for example). He seems to tour all the time, mostly in North East England. Any other fans on here? Any other NE singers I should check out?",

I need recordings by August 20th so I can edit everything together for a September release.\n\nIf you're interested, comment or DM me and I'll send you the Google Drive link with all the details - chord charts, lyric sheets, playalong tracks, and recording instructions.\n\nWould love to make something meaningful together!",

The album was produced at the [Damon Recording Studios](https://www.discogs.com/label/167880-Damon-Recording-Studios) also in Kansas. They were also associated with a group named Jonogle Music which I also can't find anything about. The only other name attached is that the composers name is N. Pack.\n\nAny help with finding a recording of Yellow Daisy or anything else the band released would be greatly appreciated, thank you so much to anyone who sees this.",

My first ever online release, 10 tracks all covers recorded on my iPhone voice memos than mixed and mastered in GarageBand to sound like old tape from the 60s\n2. The second track I recorded at my gf’s (at the time) apartment while a party was happening outside her room (door slams that are on beat / her laughing on time with the lyrics)\n3. For track 4, I covered “I lost something in the hills” by Sibylle Baier,  as far as paying homage to the original goes, I think my take is eerily accurate.\n4. The album cover: gf and I went to a vintage store that had old Polaroids and one stuck out, I took a picture of me holding the guitar that was used to record half the album (also belonged to my ex ex) and color matched it to make it look like I was there in 1929. The sunflowers were her favorite, I like how they reflect side A (full, still living) and side b (withering and sinking)\n5. Other artists I cover include\n- David Bowie’s Lazarus\n- Gregory Alan Isakov’s Big Black Car\n- Amigo The Devil’s Letter From Death Row\n- The Lumineers’ My Eyes\n- Matt Maeson’s Grave Digger\n\nThanks for reading :) have a good one",

Вокал пронизаний емоцією, а приспів не залишить байдужим нікого.  \n  \n🎤 В основі пісні — народні рядки, адаптовані до поп-структури з сучасним аранжуванням.

The lyrics have lived in my memory ever since, though I may not remember them word-for-word — some phrases might be misheard or passed down imperfectly.\n\nHere’s what I recall:\n\n\n---\n\n&gt; I long to hear the melodies my mother used to sing\nIn memory of my childhood days, in my ears they seem to ring\nThere's an echo in each melody I love beyond recall\nThe songs my mother used to sing are the sweetest songs of all\n\nI have heard them ever singing, they oft times sang to me\nBeyond bonnie banks and beyond bonnie blays\nWhen I was but a child upon her knees\nIt was there within a mile of old Edinburgh dunes\nAnd they all too seem to ring\nBut there's no place in all the world like my Edinburgh Hughes\nAnd I'd give the world to hear again the songs my mother used to sing\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nI believe this song may have Scottish or possibly Irish origins, and seems to reference Edinburgh and “bonnie banks.” It may have been passed down orally or part of a local or family tradition, rather than a widely published piece.\n\nDoes anyone recognize this song, even partially?\nDo these lyrics resemble another known lullaby, hymn, or folk tune?\n\nI’d be grateful for any pointers — even a related melody, sheet music, or a place to look further. Thanks for keeping these old songs alive. ❤️\n\nWarm thanks,\n[",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\nThis might be a long shot, but I’m hoping the folk community (or anyone familiar with 70s British folk-rock) might be able to help.\n\nI’ve recently been tracing my family history and discovered that my great-uncle is Pat Donaldson, the session bassist known for his work with Fotheringay, Sandy Denny, Richard &amp; Linda Thompson, and many more throughout the 60s–80s. He’s my dad’s uncle (I’m Emari Stevens nee Donaldson), and I’ve only just begun to uncover his incredible legacy.\n\nWhat’s wild is that I never knew about him growing up. My relationship with my father’s side of the family has always been complicated, and finding Pat — his music, photos, and presence — has been like uncovering a living thread of family that doesn’t suck.\n\nI’ve seen that he was living in the South of France for many years, and that he participated in the Fotheringay reunion around 2016. I recently came across a stunning portrait of him taken by photographer Mark Luscombe-Whyte, and the moment I saw Pat’s face… I knew. That’s family. I look like him. I feel like him.\n\nI’ve reached out gently to people connected to him, but I know time passes and people move on. I don’t expect a direct reply from Pat — I just want to gather any memories, stories, performances, impressions, or kind words from people who might have known him, seen him perform, or just loved his work.\n\nWhether you knew him personally or admired him from afar, please feel free to share. I’d be so grateful to carry those pieces with me. Thank you so much for reading.\n\n— Emari Stevens",

Her lyrics didn't emphasize the hereafter at all, and instead of \"I'm just going over Jordan\", back then she sang that line as \"I'm just going over yonder\".\n\nI felt connection to the tune myself because when life has repeatedly broken me, I'd go back to my Mother and Father, still living in the big old house in the small town I grew up in.  So I'm working on my own version of the tune, but with emphasis on (repeatedly) re-inventing my life in *this* world by healing under Mom and Dad's actual roof, rather than looking forward to death and hoping to see them in the Hereafter. \n\nIf you have Earthly lyrics for this tune, please share!",

    "content": "This is a long shot but I've been going a little insane here. I have recently fallen in love with Eggclab7's rewrite of Lark in the Morning on the Landworkers' Alliance album called Stand Up Now. However, there's no resource online with the lyrics, and I can't discern them on my own. I know that the CD comes with all the lyrics, but I'm in the US and their website won't even let me buy the digital download without a UK address. \nIs there anyone here who happens to have this CD, or can anyone point me in the right direction? Seriously this is bugging me so much.",

    "content": "My dad used to play this song a lot in his car, but he seemed to have forgotten the premise of the song and I doubt he’d remember the title either. But the song is about a relationship going wrong: the girlfriend believes Elvis is alive and doesn’t want to accept help. One of the lines is, “In a small voice, she would say,’This is my world let it be’”. And another line is,”Jellyfish trapped inside”. But I obviously don’t know who sings the song. It seems very obscure. I have tried searching up the lyrics, but no results come up for this song. So please tell me if you know what it is. Thanks :)",

    "content": "New album from Anna Tivel coming in August! The way she talks about it gives me chills:\n\n“Every album is a snapshot, a momentary study of the way a mind reaches for understanding. I can feel myself reaching in these songs, for whatever is right beyond my grasp. Mortality and connection. Suffering and meaning. People lead the narratives, come into orbit, spin away again – an exhausted mother at a freeway exit, an aging neighbor surrounded by a growing pile of newspapers, the unsung heroes of a midwest uprising, two lovers looking at the sky.\n\nIt’s hard to know how to hold a creative life in a time that feels fraught with venomous division, careening technological advance, and an ever widening chasm between the affluent and the dispossessed. What good are poems when affordable housing is scarce, the climate teeters on a dangerous edge, and war breaks out over misinformation spread by profit hungry algorithms? I think about being here. How brief it is. How incomplete our understanding. I think about history. All the worlds we’ve created and broken. Revolution and renaissance. Hope and humility. Everyone here is living a creative life – teachers and parents, kids and convenience store clerks. We’re all tasting this wild existence, finding ways to express how much it hurts and moves us. This work is my own small addition to that communal story. The water we swim in. The way our attention molds our truths. Humanity is unfolding as we describe it. We’ll never get it right, but the attempt is everything.”",

    "title": "Folk influences on Russian music I noticed.",
    "content": "SHORT VERSION  \nI noticed that I enjoyed some music from Russia that seemed to have a much different feel than western music. It had some kind of folk influences or instruments but not the folk I am used to.  Such groups do not exist in the US and if they did they would starve. So I asked around and got some answers.   I am familiar with lots of foreign music going way back like Sergio Mendes, Ravi Shankar, Brazilian folk, northern EU  pagan.  but this Russian music had a folk influence that was way different.  Russians can reach back further in time and space compared to US/UK  folk.\n\nIn short, Russians (and other neighbors) can draw on ancient folk music and instruments in modern music if they wish, and they are. USSR  pushed folk music across the USSR including minority region music. After USSR there were lots of re-enactments including folk inspired music. This led to folk inspired music from various regions including Northern EU and  Russia. Some video games included folk music. I included a couple of video links. One is a song from Melntisa as an example. The other is an example of \"buhurt\", modern  medieval fighting in Russia. I asked grok to find the closest western groups to didula. It produced a list and none were close. the closest was Pat Metheny group which was snot even close.\n\nHere is one song from the Russian folk rock group Мельница aka Melnitsa (Mill) formed in 1999.  \n[https://youtu.be/JVNyzmpUFDY](https://youtu.be/JVNyzmpUFDY)  \nМельница - Господин Горных Дорог - Live in Moskva, 5.12.2024  \nHere is another example. OTTA ORCHESTRA  \n[https://youtu.be/C1iL0h-j5p4](https://youtu.be/C1iL0h-j5p4)\n\ndidula [https://youtu.be/58Zd8PUuHQo?list=RD58Zd8PUuHQo&amp;t=384](https://youtu.be/58Zd8PUuHQo?list=RD58Zd8PUuHQo&amp;t=384)\n\notava yo [https://youtu.be/Wdfg602XEls](https://youtu.be/Wdfg602XEls)\n\nMUSICTOGETHER / МУЗЫКАВМЕСТЕ [https://youtu.be/AGtl-gU978A](https://youtu.be/AGtl-gU978A)\n\n#  \n\n# LONG VERSION\n\n# There is a female vocalist/harpist/song writer, acoustic guitar, woodwind, bass, percussion.\n\n#  [https://youtu.be/Qcg12Z8kAx0?t=1142](https://youtu.be/Qcg12Z8kAx0?t=1142)\n\nNote the crowd size and how they sing along.  \nWhy is this group in Russia but not US?  \nIn US folk music means UK and US folk music using UK instruments like guitar, banjo, fiddle. If you go  back in time before European settlement say 1600 there is no older folk music in North America but there was elsewhere in the world. Native Americans  IMO had little and did not pass it on. They did not write it down or draw the instruments. I recall 500 nations in North America?   \nI follow Russian musician Alina Gingertail and notice instruments. Many are folk instruments that go further back in time. She first played a 3 stringed domra that only was reproduced because a broken domra was found in a barn in 1896. It was first made in 1500s, evolved from Turkish instruments, and banned in 1648 by the tsar.  \nShe also plays the Gudok (1000 AD) and Rebec (900 AD). None of these survived. They were recreated from sketches and maybe fragments found in peat bogs. Also Gusli (1000 AD) and Psaltery (900 AD). Also Svirel (900 AD).Hammered dulcimer (900 AD). Many evolved from Turkish or other middle eastern instruments. Anyway, these and other folk instruments evolved are part of Russian and other folk music.  \nThe USSR supported such folk music and standardized it. Many towns and villages had a \"house of culture\" where such music was played, sometimes by official USSR folk groups. So this kept the traditions alive through 1990 and people all learned the same folk songs growing up although the USSR encouraged minority folk music across the USSR.\n\nFrom r/askarussian  \n**In the USSR, folk music was utilized as a significant ideological tool for cultural propaganda, fostering national unity and a unified Soviet identity by celebrating traditional ethnic music and creating state-sponsored folk orchestras and ensembles.** While promoting a positive, proletarian image of Soviet culture, particularly against Western influences, the state also standardized and professionalized folk music, suppressing its spontaneous nature in favor of controlled, choreographed performances and distorting its authenticity.  \n...  \nFinally, there's the identity factor. Russia has a very long history and people are often looking for ways to connect with their cultural roots in a modern form. Not only Russians. I also know some modern folk bands performing in minority languages. The most popular ones, I think, are Otyken and Ay Yola. But there are many more across different genres - for example, I even know a Tatar folk death metal band.  \n...  \n**Melnitsa's lead singer for example, her first audience was a crowd of larpers / reconstruction enthusiasts. Those hobbies saw insane popularity in Russia in 90s and 00s (we are the birthplace of buhurt, fyi)**. At the time it wasn't really folk rock, much rather just simple singer/songwriter stuff which already was super common since the 80s because of Soviet era \"bard music\" (think Vysotsky, Bashlachev and the likes). But the \"setting\" in which it all came about, I think, lead to incorporation of folk elements: lyrically and thematically first, and instrumentally later.  \nModern - like since 2012 to current time - fascination with folk rock imo is more of a global phenomenon. It just happened to become a trend in popular culture. First it was the \"Irish\", then the \"Vikings\" and then the \"Slavic\". This is more thanks to videogames, tv series and all that\n\n...  \n**Grok says**  \n**Buhurt is a modern full-contact combat sport that recreates medieval melee battles, where participants wear full suits of armor (up to 100 pounds) and fight using blunt steel weapons such as swords, axes, and maces.** Fighters compete in team-based \"last-man-standing\" formats, aiming to ground opponents through strikes or grappling, with referees ensuring safety and scoring on points if needed. It's governed by organizations like the International Medieval Combat Federation (IMCF) and Buhurt International (BI), and emphasizes historical authenticity while prioritizing blunt edges to prevent lethal injuries.  \n[https://youtu.be/wuRUbOxi2W4?list=PLVmg3ofLiKGoew6Oc4wg9vULZU6c1Dxkf](https://youtu.be/wuRUbOxi2W4?list=PLVmg3ofLiKGoew6Oc4wg9vULZU6c1Dxkf) **this makes sense now Buhurt. Alina sings while Russians fight.**  \nI later found Slavic folk music. Much Polish. Then German and Scandinavian.  \nBelow is the English translation of the lyrics to Королевна (Queen) by Мельница (Melnitsa), as requested. The song is a poetic folk-rock ballad with mythological and romantic themes, and I've aimed to preserve its lyrical tone while making it natural in English.\n\nThe lyrics below are nothing like anything in the west.  \nQueen (Королевна) – English Translation\\[Instrumental\\]  \n\\[Verse 1\\]  \nI sang of gods and heroes bold,  \nOf clashing blades and battles told;  \nWhile my falcon stayed by my side,  \nHis cry was my prayer, my guide.  \nBut now a year has passed since he flew—  \nA stranger's hand took him, it's true.  \nAnd since that day, I sing alone,  \nOf my queen, my queen, my own.  \n\\[Chorus\\]  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's delight,  \nIn your dark eyes shines the starry night,  \nIn your golden braids, the river's flow.  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's own woe,  \nYou are my fate, my sorrow's call,  \nMy endless, mad, and radiant thrall.\n\n\\[Verse 2\\]  \nI roamed through forests, swamps, and streams,  \nO'er mountains high and rivers' gleams,  \nTo find her trace, to hear her call,  \nTo bring my falcon back, my all.  \nBut found her shadow in moonlight's glow,  \nHer eyes a chasm, her heart aglow.  \nAnd since that night, I sing alone,  \nOf my queen, my queen, my own.\n\n\\[Chorus\\]  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's delight,  \nIn your dark eyes shines the starry night,  \nIn your golden braids, the river's flow.  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's own woe,  \nYou are my fate, my sorrow's call,  \nMy endless, mad, and radiant thrall.\n\n\\[Bridge\\]  \nOh, how the wind howls o'er boundless plains,  \nHow waves crash hard on cliffs' remains!  \nSo my heart lies captive, bound by thee,  \nMy queen, in your spell, I cease to be.\n\n\\[Verse 3\\]  \nNow I sing of love that cannot be,  \nOf parting, longing, memory.  \nOf my falcon soaring in distant skies,  \nAnd of her—my queen with starlit eyes.  \nThough fate may keep us forever apart,  \nA sorceress tearing my beating heart,  \nIn my songs, you'll live eternally,  \nMy queen, my only, my destiny.\n\n\\[Chorus (Outro)\\]  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's delight,  \nIn your dark eyes shines the starry night,  \nIn your golden braids, the river's flow.  \nMy queen, my queen, my heart's own woe,  \nYou are my fate, my sorrow's call,  \nMy endless, mad, and radiant thrall...  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nNotes  \n•   The translation keeps the poetic and emotional essence, reflecting the song's folkloric and romantic themes. Imagery like the falcon, starry eyes, and river-like braids draws from Slavic mythology and nature.",

His influence on Croce’s sound can’t be overstated. He too died in that same plane crash as Jim. Maury was a young 24 years old.\n\nMaury was, and will always be remembered as, an unsung hero of Jim Croce’s legacy.",

    "title": "Show Thoughts: The Tallest Man On Earth at The 9:30 Club on Sunday, October 5th (With The Still Tide)",
    "content": "I saw the Tallest Man on Earth on Sunday, October 5th at The 9:30 Club in Washington, D.C., and it was a very intimate show. Maybe the most intimate that I’ve been to. The music was very good, as (Kristian Mattson) is such a special guitarist and overall performer. He definitely requires a certain taste just because his voice is, well, his voice. It’s not pretty, but it’s oh so powerful if you like it. But it was clear that he was playing around with some ideas of his on how to play songs differently. I didn’t like all the experiments, all the different versions, but I respected them for what they were, because they all seemed to come from his desire to pull something new from his songs. A very folk mindset, but I still think he is not your stereotypical folk singer. I also think he puts pressure on himself to learn new instruments, and that’s partly why he’s thrusting them into his songs. \n\nAnyways, my biggest takeaway from the show was not necessarily the music, but the things Mattson said. The short stories he told, and the honesty he gave to the audience about his life, and the way he shared his view of the world (a small version of that view, atleast). I really like the way he shares what he’s thinking, it is fascinating to me. \n\nSo, the music was wonderful. I think it was better the first time I saw him, but I am such a fan, so “better” doesn’t feel like an accurate term, because I am almost always going to think his songs are great live unless he plays a banjo version that I don’t enjoy as much for every song. I felt the music more the first time, I guess, and the second time, I felt Mattson more overall, in addition to his music. But enough with the comparisons, let me just tell you about this show first. \n\n**Fan Context:** \n\nAs I’ve shown already, I am a huge fan of The Tallest Man On Earth. I have known his music since I was in high school, one of the last artists I remember having burned on a CD (my brother burned it for me, I wish I could say I was cool enough to know how to burn a CD). But, I didn't wrap myself in his music for very long, like I’ve done recently. I went away from him for years. I liked him, but didn’t feel the need to go deeper into his music. But I started listening to more of him over the last three years, and in the past year or so, I have held his music in such high regard. I said in [my first review of his show at the Strathmore Theatre in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/indie/comments/1jywsw8/show_thoughts_tallest_man_on_earth_headlining_at/) that I’ve recently found his music very calming, and it makes me crave nature. He’s so descriptive, he always seems to be around nature, and his overall sound grabs me so hard that I wonder about his life. Not just his lyrics, but his *sound* paints flashes of film in my mind of what I think he’s describing, but it’s not so direct. He makes me think very imaginatively, and there aren’t any other artists that have the same effect to the extent that he does. Recently, I’ve said that I think he’s the closest that anyone will ever come to making English sound like a romance language. And his guitar playing is so unique and creative, and just immensely impressive, there is no artist that compares to him in my mind. Anyways, enough with my fangirling.\n\n**The Show…** \n\nTMOE came on stage at 9:00, after The Stilltide came off at 8:41. A short wait between sets, which is great. \n\nHe walked onto the stage with that fully Swedish song of his playing in the background, I believe it’s “For Sent for Edelweiss,” but it’s a really distorted version, sounds very old, like it’s being played on vinyl. It’s cool though, I like it, and I wonder if there is actually a difference between the one they use on tour vs. the studio recording. \n\nMattson turned and looked really gratefully into the crowd, putting his hand over his heart. After a round of applause, he started by playing the violin (fiddle, in this case?). He played an intro with a bow first, then came up to the microphone and started picking it, playing it like a mandolin. Then he started singing a cover of “Moonshiner,” which I thought was a Bob Dylan cover, but later discovered that it’s a traditional folk song that’s been played by so many people, there is no known writer of it. It was a very cool way to start the show. It was so quiet in the room, and the picking of the violin strings was so faint, his voice expanded so powerfully over them. He really let it out on some lyrics, especially the build up to “I’ll go to… some HOLLOOOOWWW,” for example. He clearly loves this song, and he eventually said that it’s a traditional folk song “from where I’m from,” so I’ll have to do some digging there to see if he meant it’s from Sweden, or just Europe in general. Probably Europe, I’d guess. \n\nAnyways, I forget when he ended it, but I don’t think he got through the entire song. Thinking back, I love that as a way to start the show. A really bare intro before he starts playing guitar heavily for the next hour and a half. And his voice, it’s never been the prettiest, but when it’s standing mostly on its own like that it wakes your ears up at the very least, and introduces them to this singer. \n\nBefore starting the next song, he spoke for a minute or so, and I loved what he had to say. “Thank you so much for coming out tonight… this is exactly where I’m supposed to be, because it’s a luxury that I get to do this…” something along those lines. He talked about how no matter what’s happening in his life or in society, he thinks to himself about music: “Wait a minute, this is what it’s all about… we still do this, we’re still here… you’re my light \\[the audience\\].” He also said that that was the first time he played fiddle on stage just a moment ago for Moonshiner. And he talked about how jet lagged he was, too: “I am soooo jetlagged.” It was funny. \n\nThen Mattson started playing “A Lion’s Heart,” which was a pleasant surprise! I knew I recognized the riff, but it took me a moment to realize what song it was. Perhaps it took me a moment because he was playing it on electric, his big white guitar (I think a Les Paul?), and the studio recording is on acoustic and I’ve never heard it electric. It was stunning. It sounds so freaking good on electric, it’s awesome. The riff after the chorus, good lord. So many of his songs are given an extra feeling when played on electric guitar, much like “Love is All.” A Lion’s Heart is quietly one of the great TMOE songs I think, and one that I don’t speak enough about as one of my favorites. It was so pleasant to hear live, and the electric version was quite the gift. \n\nHe went into “Wind and Walls” next, I really liked the intro and he played it on a 12 string guitar. Super tingy sound. This was a song I recognized the name of, but I don’t think I ever listened to. Maybe I did, but just didn’t give it much of my attention. I was struck by the entrance to the chorus: “In all these riots of BROKEN sounds!” He belted that lyric out with screeching passion, which is almost a given, but I thought it was particularly attention-grabbing here, perhaps because I didn’t know the song. \n\nWithout stopping, Mattson went straight into another song, another one that I didn’t know. But I have since learned that it isn’t his. He flowed straight from the end of Wind and Walls into a cover of Blaze Foley’s “Rainbows and Ridges,” which was a really nice touch, it felt right. Like it was meant to be played as an outro to Wind and Walls. Two totally different songs, but the way he transitioned into Rainbows and Ridges made them feel naturally attached to each other.\n\nAfter this, Mattson gave a shoutout to The Stilltide, and made a joke about Anna formerly being his guitar tech, saying “she was my slave,” which got a laugh from the audience. It was funny, he then said, “I can’t joke about that,” in a tone that sounded like he was judging himself. \n\nI wrote down during this brief pause in the music while Mattson was talking: “The guy seems to struggle with his words when speaking. It's shocking, because he spews them out so confidently in song.” And I still feel that way. Many times he would start sentences and then stop a word or two into them, then restart, as if he was constantly rearranging his thoughts to make sure what he said came out how he wanted it to. That’s just my observation about him speaking. I will add, though, as I’ve mentioned, when the words do come out, I am really intrigued by what he has to say. I found his demeanor and way of speaking really interesting. He’s definitely a complex guy, but is not unrelatable. \n\nOne thing that stood out to me was that he said “Thank you for listening,” a handful of times after songs. And he said it with a tone and a facial expression that said “I’m being serious. Thank you for listening.” It’s a funny thing to say because people paid to come to a show to see him play, of course they’re going to listen, but yet he still says thank you specifically for that. I’m not saying this makes him a saint or something, almost all artists say “thank you,” but I do think it adds to the point about how genuine he is. Or maybe just how much he appreciates being able to do what he’s doing. \n\n“Every Little Heart” was after this. He plays a quality version of the song solo, of course, but this is one I’d like to hear with a full band. It’s a light song and doesn’t need a big punching sound, but I think it’s one in which the other instruments add an important backing to it. \n\nHe pulled out what I later learned was a fretless banjo next to play “Like the Wheel.” As I said, I didn’t like all of the different ways he played certain songs, and this version didn’t work for me. I think the slide guitar is so gorgeous in Like the Wheel. When I saw him the first time, it was my first time hearing the song and I thought it was stunning. It’s become one of my favorites of his, so I would have loved to hear it just as it is. BUT, it was cool to see him play an instrument you don’t see everyday, and the song was still enjoyable. Just not as much. From what I remember, he kept pretty much the same rhythm throughout the song, or at least the same strumming/picking pattern. It’s hard to describe the way he was playing this one. If you were there or have seen him play this at other shows, please add how you remember it. I just remember thinking it was a bit underwhelming, but I respect what he’s doing. He’s been playing a lot of these songs, especially that one, for a very long time, so I’d guess he’s trying to pull something new out of them, something that drives him more toward the song and makes him excited to play it. And, he shouldn't care what I want him to play, or what anyone wants him to play. \n\nThe fretless banjo had a really bouncy, wavy sound, a little hypnotic. It made a very distinct sound when he would shoot his hand up and down the (not so fret?) board. \n\nOnto a regular fretful banjo for the next song, he began by saying “This song is about Charlie Sheen,” which got a laugh. He continued, “But \\[it’s about\\] how he was on screen when I was six… I didn’t know he was going to be an asshole.” Something like that. It was funny, and I love that he sticks to that story because it’s true. Of course, the song was “Major League,” and his explanation is that he was in Cleveland when he was six years old and something about watching Major League made him want to be a baseball player. He went through this same story the first time I saw him, he said he actually played baseball in Sweden in his youth at some point. The more ya know. I could not picture TMOE playing baseball. Pretty funny. \n\nAlong this monologue, he also said “Movin’ up in the banjo world.” And he mentioned something about seeing Steve Martin play and John Hartford play. Speaking of which, if you got any John Hartford recs, let me know. Throw ‘em at me. I wanna get to know more of that guy’s music. \n\nAlso, in the middle of the song, if I remember correctly, he paused at one point. Not abruptly, but while he was strumming along and I think he got quieter and quieter and slower and slower, staring at somebody in the audience, then stopped and said, “I just got this app on my phone that turns off all the other apps, because I’m addicted to them, but it’s great I’m getting my life back…” something like that. I don’t know what led him to say that, perhaps someone was on their phone, but I don’t know. He didn’t sound annoyed, he just said that and then continued to the end of the song I believe. Please tell me if I'm off here if you were there, my memory on it is fuzzy and I’m going off of the brief notes that I wrote down. Anyways, I totally relate to the struggle of being addicted to your phone. We all are for the most part. It’s something that I think about a lot and want to change, so I loved to hear him mention that. Whether it was just a random thought or something he thinks a lot about too. Like I said, he’s complex, and weird, odd, but not unrelatable. \n\nHe did Henry Street next, and right before it he said, “I love you guys so much, here’s a song about New York.” \n\n“Love is All” was next. A vintage TMOE song, so excellent on electric. The picking sound is just so cool. He did a long intro into it that I remember from the first show, it was similar. He makes the guitar sound like it’s from space (as I’ve heard him describe the sound of Skip James playing guitar). Anyways, it was funny, during the song he went in front of the stage and squatted down low where almost no one could see him, then stood up and said “There are no monsters down there \\[below the stage\\]!” That got a laugh. \n\nHe went on perhaps his longest monologue before the next song. He talked about the “[Little Red Barn Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuB2HLAbiQw)” that he did in Sweden, which I’ve since come to learn more about and watched it. It’s awesome if you’re a fan, I highly recommend it. He mentioned that it’s his ex wife’s barn, and that they’re actually good friends now. He remembered a time when she asked him, “Could you just get a hobby that’s not music?” And that led him to start fly fishing again, which led him to find this fly fishing YouTube channel that another Swedish guy made. It was funny, he said, “...and it was early-internet, so everything was *fun,”* clearly hinting at how the internet is not very fun now, which I think most people can agree with. Just another example of him showing a bit more of his personality, and how he views things in the world. Anyways, he found a video on this channel that had “The Dreamer” playing in the background. So Mattson emailed the guy who ran the channel, thanking him for using the song. The guy then called Mattson: “He was like, ‘Dude, are you gonna sue me?’” Mattson said. Apparently the guy was paranoid about using his song illegally, it was funny. Long story short, they became friends after that, and their friendship began right around the same time that this guy (sorry, I don’t remember his name) was dating this new girl. After explaining all of that, Mattson said, “They got married this year… This song is about the gravel road where they live.” I can’t seem to find this song, which makes me think it may not have been studio released, but I remember the lyric “gravel road of time.” If I’m missing something here, somebody let me know. Because I remember liking the song, but I can’t find it anywhere! \n\nOne more note on this story, I believe it was during this monologue when talking about his ex-wife asking him about finding a hobby outside of music, he said “Because it’s my passion… and my sickness.” I thought that was a great explanation for something you love so much, that you have to have in your life, so much so that it hurts you too. “It’s my passion and my sickness.” Man, what a thing to say. What a way to explain his love for music and his need to have it as a part of his life, his need to perform, his need to share his art.  \n\n“Burden of Tomorrow” was next, which was another pleasant surprise. I had actually been listening to it for the first time in a while just a day or two before the show, and was thinking that I don’t give the song enough credit. He told a funny story before playing it, about how he wrote the song while living with someone who really hated him playing guitar. So he would have to go into another room and play very quietly at night. \n\nNext, Mattson invited Anna from The Stilltide out on stage to sing “The Dreamer,” together. He introduced her by saying, “There’s a better guitar player in the building,” something like that. A very nice compliment. \n\nI’ve seen videos of them singing this song together before this, and if you’ve seen them, this rendition was similar to most of those. Anna played guitar and they alternated the verses I’m pretty sure, but both sang the chorus together. They sang well together, but they got really quiet in the chorus, making it become a very gentle song, and it’s not quite as uplifting as the way the song usually is, and it’s not as enjoyable in my opinion. I mean, they’re great. Anna is a wonderful singer. And I know they’re just having a good time. But I like to be honest with my opinion, especially when it comes to how much I actually enjoyed a song live, even if it is one of my favorites. Anyways, it’s funny seeing Mattson without a guitar in his hand, it’s as if he doesn’t really know what to do with himself. In the beginning, he was laying on the ground behind her, not doing anything in particular that I could see, just being a goof. It was funny. They clearly love each other as friends. My girlfriend said, “It’s almost like they don’t spend every day together,” which was a good point. They never really get tired of playing this song together. They were messing around for a lot of the song, laughing through some of it. I’m happy they’re happy! I just love the guitar in that song and the lyrics, and neither were as prominent in this version.\n\nHe played “Rivers,” next. Great song. Went well. \n\nI believe Mattson then said that he was “going to play a cover,” but forgot the lyrics or something? I remember him saying “...next time.” It wasn’t a “start the song, then stop” situation, at least I don’t think so. I just remember him saying something about not being able to play a song and then saying “next time.” My memory is fuzzy on this. If you were there, please share if you remember what happened here. \n\nHe played “Revelation Blues,” next, just an excellent song. The guitar riff is so cool live, that sound and tuning is out of this world. And he played an amazing outro. A classic TMOE song, one of the best of the set, and I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s been true at all of his shows. Except I will say, having been at another show of his, I enjoyed it more this time than the first time. I was closer to the stage, and overall I think it just struck me more. \n\nMattson made a mention of the first time he did NPR Tiny Desk here in D.C. before playing the next song, I believe it was after he said a couple of nice things about the area. It was funny, he talked about how awkward it was with all the people in that small room looking at him, and basically said they didn’t give him much information/direction, and he was confused and nervous. He said sarcastically, “They were like, ‘Yeah you’re gonna go play in there… The acoustics sucks!’” That got some laughs. I wonder what all the artists who do Tiny Desk think of it, and what the whole experience is like. \n\n“I Won’t Be Found” was next. Not my favorite of his songs, not one I listen to much, but nonetheless a good song. It went well. Then, at the end, he didn’t stop playing guitar. He intro’d straight into “The Gardener,” screaming “OOOOOOOHHHH!” when he took a brief pause (or a “rest” would be the proper musical term?) just before switching strumming patterns. It was a really cool moment. Like he slowed down a little just to switch gears to something a little more energetic, and one of his best, most quintessential songs. \n\nThat closed out the set, then Mattson came back out for an encore. Didn’t take long for him to come back out. He played “King of Spain” on the fretless banjo, and I already explained how I felt about the instrument. It’s cool, really cool, but I didn’t think it added much to the song, or made it better, or created a good alternate version. It was still enjoyable. I actually wish I could hear it again, but still, it wasn’t my favorite. \n\nHis last story of the night came after this, when he told about how he got the fretless banjo. Basically, a friend of his in Sweden makes them, and he makes them using salad bowls that he gets at a market. So Mattson said, “I always look at this and wonder, ‘What food has been in here?’” It was funny. \n\nThen, he actually closed with a cover. It was “Tomorrow is a Long Time,” by Bob Dylan. It was good! I’m not a huge fan of playing a ton of covers, but I think they’re more acceptable for a band/artist who has a lot of music and has been around for a while. It’s cool to hear them do something different and get a glimpse and the music they like and their influences. And three covers isn’t “a lot” in an 18-song setlist, so, I didn’t mind them here and thought Tomorrow is a Long Time was a cool way to go out. \n\nOverall, this was a great show. But it was a very unique one for me, in which my attention and take away wasn’t completely focused on the music. I left the show with the music in the back of my head, of course, but somewhere near the front of my brain were the things that Mattson said. I felt I learned a little bit about him, his personality. Some more than I already knew. I mean, as much as one can through the lens of a performance and through some comments and some longer stories here and there. I’m not saying I know the guy, but I got a larger glimpse into his persona and how he views things in the world. \n\nAnyways, speaking on the music, it was excellent. The Tallest Man On Earth is one of the best performers you can find in music. He is so unique, and is a powerful artist to watch live. Go see him. \n\nIf you were at this show, or have seen The Tallest Man On Earth on this tour or at any time, please add your perspective in the replies. Tell me I’m dead wrong, tell me I’m right. Tell me I’m slightly off. Tell me something about The Tallest Man on Earth and I’ll be happy.\n\n**\\*One side note\\***\n\nHe was a bit goofy all night, which I know to be his personality, but it was interesting, I actually ran into the woman who was at the merch stand for TMOE the next day, because she was at the Real Estate show at The Lincoln Theatre. She mentioned to me that she thought he may have been drunk. He doesn’t strike me as a big drinker, but what do I know? He had something on stage that looked like it could’ve been beer, but that didn’t make me think he was drunk. I don’t think he was, but she made a good point. He was a bit loopier than probably usual, but he was also super jet lagged. If you were there, let me know what you think. \n\n**\\*A quick nod to the opener\\***\n\nThe Still Tide are a very cool band and a worthy opener. There songs lack a certain punch in my opinion, they’re very soft, but it’s good music and unique music. They’re just a two-piece, and the synth that they use is certainly like nothing you’ve seen before. They’ve briefly explained how it was made in the two shows I’ve seen them. It’s cool. The Stilltide is definitely worth showing up a little early for to catch a couple songs of their set. They started at 8pm, and ended at 8:41. \n\n**\\*Notes on the Venue\\***\n\nThe 9:30 Club is one of, if not *the* best venue in D.C. I’ve been to a good number of shows there over the last six months, and to me, it’s the perfect size (fills 1,200). I’ve never had any complaints about the sound there either. \n\nIt’s become my favorite venue in D.C. For a GA ticket to get you a great look from pretty much anywhere, and there’s an upper level. I personally almost always think the floor area is better for a show, but it is a great view from up there, you’re just pushing your luck on being able to hold a spot up on the balcony, depending on how big of a group you have and how early you get there. A lot more room to maneuver in the GA area. \n\nBars on both sides of the GA area, a cool record/CD room in the top right corner of the GA area, bathrooms very close by and don’t fill up very easily, and it’s easy to get to in D.C. It looks like there’s a “back bar” that you go down a stairwell to, I think it’s on your left as you walk in. I’ve never been down there, but would love to check that out. Let me know if you know what I’m talking about and have been down there. \n\n12 freakin’ dollars for a 12 ounce beer, though. That seems to be the unfortunate cherry on top of any venue anywhere. It was an IPA, I think it’s under 10 bucks for a light beer there. I’ll give them that. \n\nAnyways, go see a show at The 9:30 Club, a staple D.C. venue for good reason.",

    "content": "If this doesn’t lift your mood … I don’t know what will!\n\n“Written by Richard Carpenter (music) and John Bettis (lyrics), \"Top of the World\" was originally recorded for and released on the duo's 1972 studio album A Song for You. The song was initially intended to just remain an album cut, however, when Lynn Anderson's version, released in mid-1973, was a success, the duo was upset that they hadn't released their version as a single to begin with.[5] The Carpenters' version was later released as a single on September 17, 1973. Karen Carpenter re-recorded her lead vocal for the single release as she was not quite satisfied with the original. The new version appeared on the duo's first compilation album, The Singles: 1969-1973.” (Wikipedia)",

The usual acoustic guitar, almost monotone rough singing, the Moldy Peaches kinda vibe. As far as I remember their song titles were a little long and often didn’t have anything to do with the lyrics. I think one of their songs might have had a title that started with something like “i dont know” but im not sure? \n\nI realise I could be describing hundreds of different small YouTube singer songwriters right now, but if it rings a bell for anyone at all, please let me know!",

Along with having some great recordings, the sequencing of the Anthology is utterly masterful.  I've finished writing about the first volume, and this piece examines the sequencing, and provides an overview of the connections between the songs on Volume One.",

Since the poem talks about companionship in the form of two eagles flying together I made a lyric video with some atmospheric drone footage. The arrangement is very simple, only a classical and an electrical guitar. Hope you will like it!",

The project started a few years back with some basic bluegrass-forward melodies I had floating around in my head but when it came time to put them down, they seemed to want to take their time and envelope over time. My primary instrument on this record is Dobro and I find that exploring these ideas on the dobro really lent to a slowing down of them and creating gradients between strong melody-forward tunes into large soundscapes.  \n  \nFor the record I employed the help and talent of some of Montreal’s top bluegrass players and really explained the concept both thematically and musically and I was so happy that they understood the assignment. I also employed some analog synths in here but for the most part I am using recorded voice or sounds that were heavily modulated or plugins.\n\nThematically, there are musical themes that reoccur throughout the album. For the most part they are very simplistic in nature and tend to be around major and happy sounding chords. The reason for this is because the lyrical themes and messaging of the album are truly about the things that matter. Friendship, true love for ourselves and others, the letting go of ego-driven motivations and remembering who and what matters to us. Cheesy I know but it was something I was feeling at the time and felt that the only way to express this was to really lean into it.\n\nAnyway…The project is Ocre and the album is Magnanimity. Available where ever you listen to music…. The album is meant to be heard as a whole and I hope you get a chance to do so. Enjoy! \n\n Love you all.",
