Just wondering if anyone has that urge too?",

It’s by a male artist, specifically says the word “hearse” in the chorus and is about how everything you’ve done with your life, however much money you’ve earned, you can’t take it with you. She remembers a line that kind of went “You can’t take it with you” and I’ve seen a few songs with matching titles but she says it’s not the right one. She says it’s at least ten years old, maybe fifteen, and it sounds very country and was all over the radio at the time. Since the song got her into country, she really wants to know which one it was.

    "content": "I posted about a month ago trying to hunt down this CD, as it's the only option to find a long considered lost Louise song - \"Jean Paul\". Well, I finally took the plunge and paid out to get a rogue copy on discogs, and have uploaded the CD in full to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3qKUTMuhyw&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDsbSkLKUn0d2TGcdwqWX7f).\n\nI've also been working on high quality digitizing the rest of her work, and getting it uploaded. Got all of her albums that only ever existed on vinyl and cassette uploaded in full as well. Personally, I don't think Louise gets enough credit as an artist in her own right, aside from being Barbara's sister. Her music's a lot of fun, and it felt so wrong to me that so many other male stars of the time still get looked at as legends, but Louise sorta disappeared within the country music lexicon. \n\n  \nOnly a handful of her songs stream, and hopefully this wakes up a few more listeners to her lore!\n\nIf you end up loving her, you can find her others here:\n\n1979 - [Inseparable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqq8PZFcKMw&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRAinUjkyXfOhxR0tP_SOIdv) \\- with RC Bannon \n\n1980 - [Love Won't Let Us Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv_4ttGbscc&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRA8N7iv8R7CWYCGtEa1N1hk) \\- with RC Bannon\n\n1982 - [Me and My RC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPkNgPxw8Q8&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDLQqIR5SDuIZnzJXX1CMYO) \\- with RC Bannon\n\n1982 - [(You're My) Super Woman, (You're My) Incredible Man...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJzONtzz_rk&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDWXCD9NV_8lZN6X16lbRRh) \\- with RC Bannon\n\n1983 - [Too Hot To Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThJS3OWAn4&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDS28TWEiB6bOcgDvWjE5XG)\n\n1983 - [Close Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33dJ9k-gAP4&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDVhbzZ_CmUjOgfXNi8swvM)\n\n1984 - [I'm Not Through Loving You Yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ6jEEFBEhA&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRBH75tQZejioT1bwOHsf8dG)\n\n1985 - [Maybe My Baby  ](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mGq0wyWSBV2vPdYpjLl1iy7GTVTM2KnvE)(I didn't digitize this one, it's available for streaming)\n\n1987 - [Dreamin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFBZWm2dXCU&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRBVO97IuzxDuxkFbnlzCS6J)\n\n  \nWorking on getting her other records up and available for the masses to enjoy.

I'm like 99% sure of him ending with tonight but I could be wrong about that too.\n\n\\* It's semi-upbeat but like a mellow tone so not happy. I wouldn't count it as a ballad.\n\n  \nI have tried Shazam and Google but to no avail! Please help I'm going crazy! xD\n\n‐--------------------‐-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE!!! \n\nI found the song!!!\n\nI thought I'd heard it before and I thought it was through line dancing. So I looked through every playlist of every event I've been to this year and there it was!\n\nThe song is: Alex Warren - Troubled Waters.\n\nThank you to everyone who got involved.

The songs I mentioned sound like real music to me, like a guy with a guitar sat down and poured his feelings out. Not looking for “good time” music. BUT ALSO I don’t like super slow songs. The songs I mentioned are sort of sad but still they don’t drag out and take forever to go anywhere.

I'm like atleast 60-70% confident it's probably another George Strait song.\n\nThe best way I can explain it is this kinda chill southern (maybe even a bit beachy vibe?) Literally all I remember is a brief tune of what I assume to be the Chorus. In that part it builds up a bit louder and higher, and then descends over like 3 notes. Followed by the singer in a lower voice saying something I could never make out which was like 3 notes with the first two being low, and the last one being the lowest. After that there is a like a little light guitar riff with like 5 8th notes. The first two are the same I think and then the last 3 8th notes ascend.\n\nI know that's not much to go off of. This is one of those songs I would head fairly often in the back of my Mom's car when I was a kid. So like mid to late 2000's on the radio in South East Texas if that helps. I have also ruled out several songs. Marina del ray, seashores of old mexico, and ocean front property.\n\n Any help is appreciated.",

    "content": "So, this is just a quick rant for me to blow off some steam regarding dynamic ticket pricing. \n\nLike many people in this subreddit, I tried earlier today to get tickets to Alan Jackson’s concert. On top of the problems with the website crashing, bot blocking, and don’t get me started on the resale industry; my biggest problem is with dynamic ticket pricing. Having ticket prices go up because a lot of people are in the queue trying to buy them is one of the worst things in the modern concert/ticket buying era. It makes an already expensive purchase even worse and prices out your everyday folks. \n\nLikewise, a lot of time it’s not even the artist doing it, it is the venue or ticket provider (which is what happened with the Alan Jackson concert today. I attached a screenshot of an email someone on FB posted from Alan Jackson’s Fan Club Team proving it). I can deal with site crashes, bot blockers, and even resales (as annoying as they are) because at least I have the chance to get the tickets and I am not just immediately priced out.\n\nI know this rant ain’t going to change anything but I just need to blow off some steam. But thanks for reading and if you guys have any opinions/differing views let me hear it below!",

I was in the army myself in 2003. The timing of their comments was terrible, but it turns out they were right about everything. To be fair they did release a few more albums and had a decent amount of success. But nowhere even remotely close to the level they were at before Iraq. It seems like they would have had a career renaissance around 2007-2008 and had the best record sales of their careers. \n\nThey released a Gaslighter album in 2020 but aside from that and the occasional music festival they’ve basically disappeared.",

She was nonverbal, had to be fed, was in a wheelchair and she loved her country music. When the music was on she would sing her whoop whoops, rocking back and forth, just as happy as can be. \n\nThey took Janie to see one of her favorites, Reba McEntire. Janie was about 20 at the time and they knew Reba was one of her favorites because she whooped the loudest whenever Reba was playing. \n\nThey had front row seats and while Reba was singing Janie was rocking back and forth whooping as loud as she could. Her parents just hoped she wasn't upsetting the people next to them. \n\nReba looked down at Janie and suddenly stopped the music. She told her audience \"sorry, but there's a little girl I need to go say hello to real quick.\" And she got off the stage to talk to Janie. Reba knelt in front of Janie's wheelchair and said hello. Janie, excited whooped and a little spit came out, hitting Reba. Her mother, embarrassed, apologized. Reba told her don't you apologize. It's fine. This sweet girl is just fine. Reba spoke to Janie for a few more minutes, holding her hand and then went right back to her show. \n\nI've always loved that story. Every time I see Reba or hear something about her, I remember how kind and generous she is. How wonderful she is to her fans. And how patient she was with our sweet Janie.",

When I search online, all I ever see is traditional waltz style two step, but no one under 50 dances like that anywhere I go.. \nPeople around my age tend to do the style that is more like two steps diagonally/sorta to the side but forward? &amp; then one step the other way, and repeat. Way less formal, more relaxed. \nThat’s what I see at every dance hall I go to in Texas, except the more experienced ones add in a lot of spins and dips and whatnot. \nBut what I’m asking about is the style.. I see it in many places (north Texas and central Texas, if that changes anything?) But yet I see NOTHING about it online??? \nIs there a name for this type or a better search term to find what I’m looking for? \nI’d appreciate any helpful info. Please be kind. I very rarely make posts. But I’m totally stumped. Thanks!",

    "content": "Hello all!! I had just joined this group to discuss a project I’m working on!! I had recently bought a collection of negatives, prints, and 35mm slides from the photographer duo Jeb &amp; Karen Davies who toured with many southern bands including Charlie Daniel’s Band, Marshall Tucker Band, Dirt Band, Outlaws, Mama’s Pride, Willie Nelson, Dickie Betts, and much much more!! \n\nInfo of the photographers: The photographers are Joseph “Jeb” Ricky Davies &amp; Karen “Feathers” Davies who were married to each other and were apart of the Macon Musicians Co-op. They toured with southern bands traveling wherever they went to take photos from the early 70s all the way up to the early 90s. Jeb Davies passed away in a car accident coming in home from a concert in Atlanta Georgia. Karen Davies passed away around 2022 from an illness which led to the photos being stored in a storage unit, which was then sold, then sold again to me!!\n\nThe collection I had bought contains over 3,000 slides, 31,000 negatives, 5,000 prints, signed photos, paperwork, and many more goodies!! And I wanted to ask if there were any diehard fans in here who would be able to possibly help date some of the shows or figure out venues as I would love to archive these photos as best as possible!! \n\nThank you all!!",

Of course I recognize though that the surface level of pretty much any genre isn't really where the true quality is at, which is why I thought it would be a good idea to ask here!\nWhenever people recommend country albums, they tend to be from at least pre 2000s, usually way before that even. My question is this: are there any modern albums (like let's say since 2020) that hold a candle at all to some of the classic stuff from the 60s and 70s? \nI should also mention that I DO love old country, I just would like to hear something new that is of the same quality. \nThank you!\n\nJust an edit, I really appreciate all of the responses.

    "title": "Country music made me view life differently",
    "content": "I am from Bosnia and Herzegovina and never in my life have i heard proper country music until this year. But bear with me since the story is somewhat long.\n\nI always liked the old american west and even the neowestern appeal that some places still have. The western genre is very popular in Ex Yugoslavia since it was one of the only things you could see on TV, because most of them didnt have anti commie messages, and they were mostly pure action. Altough i havent witnessed Yugoslavia, the influence that the westerns made on old people were still strong, so i grew up watching old western (mostly unpopular ones). I also liked reading as a child, both books and comic books. I was around 11 years old when i asked my dad to buy me a comic book. I thought that i would see a ton of Batman or Flash comics, but i was lead to a dissapointment. My father took me to a kiosk near a small pizzeria, and there i was given a chance to chose between:\n\n1. Some dude called Alan Ford\n\n2. Some white dude called Zagor whoguards Native Americans and has a fat Mexican companion called Don Chico Felipe Cayetao Lopez y Martinez or something like that (but Chico for short)\n\n3. Texas ranger called Tex Willer who is married into a Navajo tribe and his companion is Kit Carson(based on the OG Kit Carson, but looks and acts more like Bufallo Bill).\n\nI picked Zagor even tho my day was ruined , because i didnt but Batman or Marvel or something. Western comics were also very popular in Ex Yu and it remains to this day (not only westerns, but all comics from Italian publishing house SergioBonelliEditore). \n\nNow we fast forward to May last year. That was the first time i bought a Ken Parker comic book. Ken Parker is also a western, but much more serious than many others and deals with deep psychological and social themes like slavery, injustice, Native American genocide etc. It has around 90 volumes that are around 90ish pages, more or less. I finally finished it a few days before New Years eve. I rarely cry because of fiction, but this made me shead some tears. Around that time i became more interested in the historic unromanticized version of the old west. I also started playing RDR2. And i also, for the first time listened to some country music in January. I listened to Ghost Riders in the Sky by the Highwaymen, listened to Marty Robins, Kenny Rogers etc.\n\nI have to admit, that i thought that it was shit, when i listened to it the first time. In february i started reading Blood Meridian and finished it a few days before march. Then in March i started watching more westerns (good ones this time) from Moriconne, Corbucci or Peckinpah. Then in April i again gave a try for country music, but it was meh. In April is also when i learned that i am suffering from depression. It came in waves, but it fully stopped around 4th May (Im not accusing Frank Herbert of anything, but it started when i started reading Dune, and also stopped i droped the book). With depression also came, for some reason hard temptations. I try to be religious, so it wasnt easy when i got the wish to gamble, drink, lust etc, even tho i never did those things before (did smoke at the time tho). May was great. I bought some bees and decided to star beekeping. The bees were in my village (village is like 10 minutes away from the city.) where my family lives. I was living in a building in another town. With the end of May, it came back again. Then stoped and on the middle of June came back again. \n\nIt stopped on the 28th of June, which is the date when i decided to move back to my countryside. While i was driving, i turned the radio on and they were playing  only country music. You have no idea how rare it is to find country music on the radio in Bosnia. It hit me like nothing ever before. It was very weird to me that the music i hated just few months ago was now like a symphony. Since then i have been listening to country music of all kinds daily. I even put Ghost riders in the sky as my alarm clock. My life is anything but perfect now, but i learned to appreciate what i have and try to be grateful. In three days will officialy be three months since i stoped smoking and got out of depression. \n\nCountry music doesnt always make me happy. Actually, most of the times i get the weird feeling of melancholy and nostalgia for old american west i never experienced. Would love to visit there one day. Love yall from Bosnia.\n\n\n\n\nP.S. Try to ignore the spelling mistakes.",

The dad scans the room and says basically, \"There's nothing I want — only you, my son / my family.\" He also explicitly says something like \"I don't need shiny things\" or\n\"there's no shiny things I want.\" It's a simple, heartfelt, classic country dad→son message - not modern pop. I don't remember the singer's voice clearly (could be a traditional twang/ baritone). If anyone remembers a line that matches or an artist who did this kind of fatherly ballad, please throw titles at me - even obscure/ regional tracks. \n\nMoral of the story he looks at his son and tells his son there’s nothing in the world he would rather want but his son. I think the son was asking his father if he wanted anything for Father’s Day. I’m not quite sure. Anything helps! \n\nI’m looking for this song specifically for my mom. My brother passed away 3 months ago and he would listen to this song but he never told us the name of it. Thanks!",

Even though working with him was still difficult, he hated having to compromise his ideas. I‘m fairly sure he had Autism, I‘m on the spectrum and can relate with him.\n\nWe all know his quote „that ain’t no part of nothing“. Well, his musical ideal was acoustic guitar, double bass, fiddle, mandolin and five string banjo. He also would allow twelve string acoustic, dulcimer and resonator/dobro. He didn’t want percussions, lap steels and wind instruments in his music at all. Ironically tho, he did play a Fender Telecaster in private, while I‘m not sure if he ever used an acoustic guitar🤣\n\nOn the other hand, he also had a good heart. He was one of the guys to let black and white musicians play together in the South. Regularly he would dress up as Santa on Christmas. Showing his love for his audience.\n\nErgo, he could be tough to work with, but the work he would give us was an absolute pleasure.",

And when we ended our talk about it, she thanked me for being good to her and all that. \n\nSo I’ve been drinking pretty regularly since then and, last night, I unintentionally made myself throw up from drinking when I accidentally drank rum that was over 100 proof. Yeah, not a fun night. And I know I have a problem. I just don’t care currently. \n\nBut I’m curious to hear from all of you what country song you’ve turned to when going through heartbreak of some kind.",

He doesn’t want to be an entertainer, he just wants to write music. \nA few years ago, he decided that this is what he wants to write songs/music for a living. I 100% support him. He’s an amazing man. He’s so good at EVERYTHING he does.  I think they are brilliant. They are really good g and I am not being biased. Anyhoo, I’ll get to the point…. He has gotten copyrights for about 10 of them. That’s really all we could do because we have no clue where to go, who to contact. \nWe live in Northeast Alabama. There are no agents here, no music moguls, no record labels. Everything closes after 9 pm, Wal-Mart closes at 11 pm. It’s ridiculously a town that definitely sleeps, and gets lots of it! lol. \nWe knew a few people that knew R.G. One of the songs would be perfect for him. Then there were a few others we reached out via email but they all have the same answer; basically they can’t just get a song and record it. It has to go thru their record label. Oh yes, we tried reaching out to them also, with zero replies. \nSo, if anyone out there could please point us in the right direction, just please HELP!!!! We really need some help. Any advice at all would be better than just roaming on the internet blind, with no direction. \n\nThank you, ALL, in advance for taking time to read my ramblings.",

    "title": "Jimmie Skinner appreciation post",
    "content": "Excerpted from www.bear-family.com:\n\n&gt;Had the category of 'alt-country' existed fifty years ago, Jimmie Skinner would fit right in. A brilliant singer-songwriter, Skinner was an intriguing personality who literally marched to the beat of his own drummer. His music seems more suited to juke-joint Wurlitzers than genteel living room Crosleys, yet Skinner's appeal crossed gender lines, attracting as many women as men. Some cite Skinner as a primal influence on the first generation of rockabillies. Others notice parallels between Johnny Cash's early Sun sound and the stark minimalism of Skinner's classic recordings.\n\n&gt;As a songwriter, his talent was nonpareil. His admirers included Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams, Bill Monroe, Lester Flatt, Fred Rose, Jimmy Martin, and Johnny Cash. His lyrics were usually melancholy and occasionally angry; his melodies were usually catchy and occasionally hypnotic. As a performer, Skinner followed a peculiar internal clock that vexed the most patient, attentive musicians. He thrashed his guitar with as much emphasis on his upstroke as his downstroke, creating a double-time effect. More often than not, Skinner started singing on the backbeat – sometimes early, sometimes late. By his own admission, his singing voice was rough. If his blues-tinged delivery often reflected his heroes Jimmie Rodgers and Ernest Tubb, Skinner's voice was unmistakably his own – a deep, resonant baritone that seemed to growl.\n\n[Here's](https://youtu.be/wM47Eo458Mc?si=5anYgQidOzTfjvSy) Jimmie in the Ozark Jibilee, [along with his buddy Ray Lunceford](https://youtu.be/KailDBIsi_g?si=gf0a4dvToueHaV2k) on electric mandolin. Enjoy!",

Lack of awareness within those circles? Or perhaps country/western DJs are hesitant to play material recorded by independent artists. Whatever the reason, I'm interested in discussing the current state of country radio programming, and ways this terrific song might be able to find a larger audience.",

(On a side note, he is a great guy to follow and tells some very entertaining stories about his time in the band and the music business.) So of course, that led me to revisit their music.\n\nI remember having their first two albums, *Live from Robert's* and *BR5-49*, on cassette, back when I was in high school. I'm really enjoying listening to songs like \"Little Ramona Gone Hillbilly Nuts\" and  \"18 Wheels and a Crowbar\" (the only song i've ever heard about a truck driving serial killer) again.\n\nI would describe their sound as rockability, a mix of country and 1950s rock and roll, although I believe they really just considered themselves a country band.\n\nNow i'm just trying to figure out who sings lead on what songs, as they had two lead singers, Gary Bennett and Chuck Mead. (I saw Chuck Mead and his Grassy Knoll Boys open for OCMS years ago and they were great...one of the times in my life I've wished an opening act had played a longer set.)",

I’m so unbelievably impressed that I’m almost inclined to believe that it’s some sort of rumor her PR team made up to draw interest or some amazing sound mixing in the booth, but from what I’ve seen, it’s legitimately her.

I didn’t grow up with this music bc I was born and raised in the UK so I’m starting fresh. \n\nRecommendations welcome - I like a slower, more soulful sound. Man or woman singer, don’t care.

We want to be as close as possible to the stage but we’re debating on what time to get to the venue. I’m thinking 6+ hours before to “camp out” in the GA line. We don’t mind waiting we were gonna bring some cheap folding chairs (to just toss away after we get in), snacks, drinks, etc. to pass the time. What’s everyone’s recommendation, should we get there earlier to secure spots closest to the stage or am I overthinking this ?",

For what is worth, I listen to \"country-adjacent\" artists like Sheryl Crow, K.D. Lang, and Fleetwood Mac. Maybe there are country songs/artists similar to who I just suggested?",

Guitar player Ryan Engleman went on to play for Reckless Kelly and Kyle Nix went on to do his thing, and I’m sure I’m not the only one who thought Turnpike was well and truly done for after that — or, at best, that it would never be quite the same if and when they got back together.\n\nBut they did get back together, and they released *A Cat in the Rain*, which was as good as anything they’ve ever done...and then not quite two years later, they just casually drop *The Price Of Admission* with less than a week’s notice, and it just might be the best album of their entire career. Try as I may, I can’t think of any other band that’s managed to pull anything like that off. It’s something to see, and I am absolutely here for it.",

I grew up on country (born in the mid 90s), but it only makes up maybe 10-15% of what I listen to on a regular basis—I don’t really vibe with most pop country. That percentage will be going up a little bit now.\n\nI was not expecting to enjoy his performance and music as much as I did. I even thought Charley Crocket sounded better as an individual last night. Both bands were great, but Leon felt more carried by his and the incredible saxophonist whose name I’m forgetting. No shade for Leon though, he still put on a great show, I just thought Charley sounded better yesterday.\n\nIf anyone has a chance to go see him live on this tour, I’d definitely recommend it!",

Even looking back to the 2000s, there was still some decent traditional country. Now, much of it feels more like pop or hip hop than country. Maybe I’m just getting older, but what do others think?",

She remembers a line that kind of went “You can’t take it with you” and I’ve seen a few songs with matching titles but she says it’s not the right one. She says it’s at least ten years old, maybe fifteen, and it sounds very country and was all over the radio at the time. Since the song got her into country, she really wants to know which one it was.

    "title": "Louise Mandrell \"Lost Media\"",
    "content": "I posted about a month ago trying to hunt down this CD, as it's the only option to find a long considered lost Louise song - \"Jean Paul\". Well, I finally took the plunge and paid out to get a rogue copy on discogs, and have uploaded the CD in full to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3qKUTMuhyw&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDsbSkLKUn0d2TGcdwqWX7f).\n\nI've also been working on high quality digitizing the rest of her work, and getting it uploaded. Got all of her albums that only ever existed on vinyl and cassette uploaded in full as well. Personally, I don't think Louise gets enough credit as an artist in her own right, aside from being Barbara's sister. Her music's a lot of fun, and it felt so wrong to me that so many other male stars of the time still get looked at as legends, but Louise sorta disappeared within the country music lexicon. \n\n  \nOnly a handful of her songs stream, and hopefully this wakes up a few more listeners to her lore!\n\nIf you end up loving her, you can find her others here:\n\n1979 - [Inseparable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqq8PZFcKMw&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRAinUjkyXfOhxR0tP_SOIdv) \\- with RC Bannon \n\n1980 - [Love Won't Let Us Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv_4ttGbscc&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRA8N7iv8R7CWYCGtEa1N1hk) \\- with RC Bannon\n\n1982 - [Me and My RC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPkNgPxw8Q8&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDLQqIR5SDuIZnzJXX1CMYO) \\- with RC Bannon\n\n1982 - [(You're My) Super Woman, (You're My) Incredible Man...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJzONtzz_rk&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDWXCD9NV_8lZN6X16lbRRh) \\- with RC Bannon\n\n1983 - [Too Hot To Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThJS3OWAn4&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDS28TWEiB6bOcgDvWjE5XG)\n\n1983 - [Close Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33dJ9k-gAP4&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRDVhbzZ_CmUjOgfXNi8swvM)\n\n1984 - [I'm Not Through Loving You Yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ6jEEFBEhA&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRBH75tQZejioT1bwOHsf8dG)\n\n1985 - [Maybe My Baby  ](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mGq0wyWSBV2vPdYpjLl1iy7GTVTM2KnvE)(I didn't digitize this one, it's available for streaming)\n\n1987 - [Dreamin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFBZWm2dXCU&amp;list=PLxFgH2muByRBVO97IuzxDuxkFbnlzCS6J)\n\n  \nWorking on getting her other records up and available for the masses to enjoy. I don't make any money on this, I just think her work is important.",

    "content": "I'm going to do like someone did 7 years ago and post it here as well as TOMT in the hopes of someone being able to recognize it. \n\n  \nThis is what I know: \n\n\\* Male singer\n\n\\* Sounds like a country song\n\n\\* Sounds like a newish song (not older than 10 years but I'm guessing it's pretty new because I heard it on the radio yesterday)\n\n\\* The chorus starts with \"whoaohohohoh\" (like a continous wailing-like sound) or actually it's more like the build-up to the actual chorus, if you know what I mean.\n\n\\* The chorus ends with WHAT I THINK sounds like \"'cause I'm drowning in the waters, drowning in the waters tonight\" but I have googled this phrase and different versions of it and I don't think that's what he's actually singing. I'm like 99% sure of him ending with tonight but I could be wrong about that too.\n\n\\* It's semi-upbeat but like a mellow tone so not happy. I wouldn't count it as a ballad.\n\n  \nI have tried Shazam and Google but to no avail! Please help I'm going crazy! xD\n\n‐--------------------‐-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE!!! \n\nI found the song!!!\n\nI thought I'd heard it before and I thought it was through line dancing. So I looked through every playlist of every event I've been to this year and there it was!\n\nThe song is: Alex Warren - Troubled Waters.\n\nThank you to everyone who got involved. I can recommend this song as a thanks &lt;3",

A week later I had George Jones, George Strait, Randy Travis, Marle Haggard, Willie Nelson and a bit of Dolly Parton. I have already fallen in love with this sound but I'm finding it difficult to get new current artists and music with a similar sound. Any Suggestions?",
