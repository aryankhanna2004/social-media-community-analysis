I discovered it a few months ago, and today when I went to relisten I found out it has been taken off of streaming in the US. It’s kind of obscure, so I’ve been scouring the internet for a way to download it and all I can find is a low quality rip on youtube. Does anyone know a good way to bypass reigon-locking? It seems to be available in Japan still on Apple Music",

Here is a little information about TEAM NIVA:\n\nWe are a passionate but small team, currently only 3-4 people (I am trying to gather more). We work with eachother, because we believe that teamwork is better then working alone. \n\nCurrently we focus on our series, which is called \"Solitary In Snow\". Solitary In Snow is an anime style Open World RPG about a young teenage boy named Seedy that fights demons.\n\nWhat I am looking for In a music composer:\n\nI am looking for someone who is experienced in making Emo (Emptional) J-pop. For vocals, we will probably either use vocaloid or any other voice synth, but if you are good at singing, thats great too. \n\nI will provide reference music you can listen to, to get an idea of what kind of music I need.\n\nContact method: it is preferable that you contact me on discord. My discord is: seedy_.\n\nIf you are unable to contact me on discord then you can make a comment on this post or message me on reddit normally.",

I thought it was Becky but it is not, I think.\n\nShe seemed to have come out of no where (to me) I remember her single being posted in Livejournal MP3 sharing groups and I'd never heard of her. The single was of her with really long hair and I think there were balloons or something? Maybe her eyes were closed?? Confetti? i can't fully remember.\n\nBut I DO remember she was a very good singer and people were talking about how she sang in whistle register - the song was a ballad i think and one of the first few words/notes was in the high note.\n\nI feel like she had a non Japanese name?",

    "content": "Hello all! I am traveling to Japan for the first time in a week (US). Coincidentally, a few weeks ago I happened to discover a Japanese band named Maverick Mom. I instantly loved them - just the type of music I loved (but in Japanese). I then happened to discover that even further coincidentally, they are playing at a music festival in the area I have had a hotel booked for months (Shimokitazawa) at the Knockout FES festival.  \n  \nHonestly, may sound cheesy, but felt like destiny or something. Instantly decided that I had to go. Plus, tickets were only $25 USD? Easy money. \n  \nAnyway, I’m not new to live music or even festivals at all but I obviously AM new to this genre, the country, live music in Japan, etc. I can’t think of a better way to experience the culture than through listening to local bands with locals.  \n  \nMy questions are… Anything I should know? What should I expect? Any norms I should be aware of? This type of festival where bands kind of take over venue throughout the city vs just like festival grounds is something new to me… but very cool. Can I just kind of bounce around from one place to the next? Anyway, I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has been to this festival or anything similar here and has anything to share about it or advice to give.  \n  \nThanks!",

Vào xem profile thì  hình như là hoạ sĩ, vừa hát vừa khui chay whiskey loại nhỏ màu vàng ý. Thanh niên ấy là người Nhật luôn. Ai còn giữ cho mình xin với nhé\n\nI’m not sure if anyone still has that cover of “One Love” by Arashi from that guy on TikTok. He sang so well, but it seems like the video got deleted — maybe because it showed him opening a bottle of liquor. I checked his profile and it looks like he’s an artist; in the video, he was singing while opening a small yellow bottle of whiskey. He’s Japanese. If anyone still has that video saved, please share it with me. 3kyuu",

    "content": "I’ve been imagining Perfume’s JPN Tour stage transplanted into arenas across North America or  Europe or china.For this experiment I’m using the Budokan style version with a single central runway instead of the left and right catwalks seen in other JPN Tour stops.\nThe reason Budokan only had one runway is pretty simple the venue is smaller so adding side catwalks would have made the stage cramped and complicated for both performers and audience. Single runway setups make the show safer easier to manage and still deliver that signature Perfume energy.\nIf the JPN Tour had gone global it’s fun to think about how this single runway stage would feel in a bigger arena. Would it still give the same impact or would side catwalks be necessary to reach the crowd?\nI’m planning to drop this stage into an arena map to see how it works. Perfume fans and stage design enthusiasts what do you think?",

    "content": "Lately I’ve been diving into the deep corners of Perfume’s history and it got me wondering just how much lost media might exist from their long career. For a group that’s been active since the early 2000s and evolved through so many eras there must be moments that slipped through the cracks TV appearances that never re aired demo tracks that never made it to an album or tour footage that vanished between edits.\nI’ve seen fans mention a few things over the years rumored alternate versions of music videos early indie era performances from Hiroshima that only aired locally and even talk of songs that were cut from live shows before release. It’s wild to think how much might still be sitting somewhere on a forgotten hard drive or in a broadcast vault.",

    "content": "Hey, so as someone who's deep into Western and K-pop, I find J-pop content is hard to discover.\n\nFirst of all, I'm starting with Snow Man, bc of Meguro Ren. I only found that their old music are only on a compilation album? And they're just the greatest hits. Other than that,just this year's releases.\nWhen I look em up on the internet, they got over 100+ songs including unit and solo songs. And those are not available anywhere even on Spotify and YouTube.\nLooked it up on google, nothing came up.\nMost of them are only available in physical cd and then most of them does not ship to my country.\n\nAnd forget to mention that their video contents are pretty hard to find lol, like some videos were from 3-4 years ago with no english subtitle and all.\nIt's kinda frustrating.\n\nEDIT: I hope this does not offend anyone. I'm just new to this 🙂",

Maybe they were also trying to credit a different sayuri but it chose the wrong artist. \n\nIm not too sure about how the crediting works on spotify but i assume you would need mutual consent from all parties. If this is really a case of hacking to use her following as a platform to boost their streams, then its just deplorable and a stain on her legacy. \n\nIm only assuming its hacking because it’s happened to TUYU’s account before to re-release their deleted pony canyon affiliated songs. \n\nIf anyone has a better insight on this please do enlighten me 🙏",

I know her covers are ai, as an artist I can differentiate between real and ai art, although I would say her covers are too obvious. but is her music fake too? I am talking about the last 15 songs. I found those songs on YouTube but I don’t know if she is also releasing physical copies of them too. Finding info about her is kinda hard, maybe because she is not that popular. And the reason I am saying this is because the last 15 songs was released really weirdly. Like 5 at a time. some of the are too different from others and two of them sounds different than others. ",

    "content": "Hi! I never posted here before and I apologise if this isn't the right place to ask, but I got this song I listened to years ago and can't find it again.\n\nI first found this song around 2015-2016 on YouTube while looking for songs to put on my iPod. It didn't contain the title of the song other than \"Cute Japanese song\" \"Cute Jpop song\" (Or along the lines of). The video isn't on YouTube anymore.\n\nHere is what I can remember:\n\n- The hook/beginning (?) of the song has the female singer saying some random words, something like \"Konyo nya nyo nyo nyo\" and then an \"Oh!\" At the end.\n\n- Upbeat, happy sounding, dance/electro? Had a semi-fast beat.\n\n- The female singer sings the beginning and hook while the male raps the middle parts, the singer even intercepts during some of it (Few words I remember her saying simply \"Arigatou!\" \"Honto ni?\" \"Honto desu ka?\")\n\n- After the 2nd hook, there's a part where they sing together and the first part sounding like \"My best friend\". Either English or a mishearing of Japanese words.\n\n- I remember the thumbnail had the girl singer on it. She was a burnette/brownhair and she had her hair up (Either in a ponytail or pigtails?). I think she wore yellow?\n\n- Considering I found the video 2015-2016, the song likely came out 2000s or early 2010s.\n\nThat's sadly all I can remember since this was nearly a decade ago, I'm also terrible at describing music. Any help is appreciated.",

It’s a song that carries their resolve, their passion, and the weight of everything they’ve faced to get here.\n\n“PROOF” is my answer to that. It’s a song born from pride — our pride — for everything Ae! group has become, and everything they continue to be. It’s also a song of gratitude, for the light they’ve given us through their journey, and of resolve, to keep walking alongside them as they chase even bigger dreams.\n\nEvery lyric carries the voice of someone who has watched them fight, stumble, rise, and shine — someone who has been inspired by their unwavering spirit. It’s a promise: we’ll keep believing, no matter the distance, no matter the unknowns ahead.\n\nBecause being here, together, in this moment — Sharing the same sky, the same beat, the same dream — That’s already proof enough.",

Honestly this interested me and honestly it's makes the group look unique!.\n\nSo are there any other girl groups out there where they had a original name then took a break made a comeback and rebranded?.\n\n[Buzy MV (this is there comeback single, I couldn't find a Color MV strangely?.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co2gAPZEMwM)",

    "content": "This is a long shot but I am looking for a Jpop music video that I used to watch on YouTube as a kid from the 2000s. \n\nThe video was of a woman who was getting her hair cut into a shorter boyish looking cut. The background was all white and video has no other major accent visuals and focused on her singing during the haircut. \n\nI roughly remember the lyrics maybe starting with “boku ne—“ (?). I could be wrong with this part since it was so long ago. The title of the YouTube video was “Japanese Haircut” so it hasn’t been easy trying to find the video. ",

Noticing three of its songs are sung by a male voice apart from kase. (夏背), I was wondering who that was. At first I thought that could be Orangestar himself but I couldn't find anything searching and it seems like he still keeps without singing his songs. Any idea?",
