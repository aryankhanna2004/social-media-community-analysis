    "content": "This is an excerpt from [this GRAMMY article](https://www.grammy.com/news/japanese-artists-to-know-hana-band-maid-yuki-chiba). \n\nAs a Filipino male, 31, with a physique slightly smaller than [Ma Dong Seok, who is my role model because he likes being cute](https://www.instagram.com/p/DG-Jq3bJqKX/?img_index=2), am confused.\n\nit keeps bugging me why most foreigners embrace the cool idol groups. I'm not saying I don't like cool idol groups, I'm just annoyed when they skip a cute group from stanning or immersing to their visuals and fan service, even if that cute group releases bangers over bangers.\n\nAs stated in the article, despite Cutie Street, Fruits Zipper, and AiScream making waves, them being cute refrain foreigners from stanning them and only treat their music as Tiktok backgrounds, or like in most cases, associated with meme comments like \"making sure my homies left before playing this in my car\" or \"can't let the gang i'm into this fr\" like they get embarassed if they get caught liking this stuff.\n\nas a muscle dude who grew up normal with liking cute stuff, am confused.\n\nany pyschology students here?  \nwhat's the difference between Japanese men and some foreigners like me vs most foreign men and also women?\n\nthanks!\n\n\\---from a ME:I, IS:SUE, Equal Love, Cutie Street and Candy Tune stan",

    "content": "There doesn’t seem any rhyme or reason when they want to just romaji or translate. Why go out of the way to translate every single title with JP but leave out the last one? Why not “Bink’s Sake”? Why translate at all? How tf am I supposed to find a song from title? I had to learn JP to guess it?? \n\nThis is a rant btw. I just don’t like unorganised things like this lol\n\nIdk this seems like a recent trend I noticed, especially on Spotify. I guess it’s because jpop is much more accessible now so they thought translating the title would make it easier to non-JP speakers to consume. I had to learn JP myself for 20+ years purely from exposure just to read them 😅",

    "content": "My mom was born in 1970, and she once told me: the first time she watched Michael Jackson sing and dance on stage, she thought she was seeing a performance king. No joke.\n\nBE:FIRST just dropped their cover of *I Want You Back* — originally by The Jackson 5 — and they added their own flavor to make it feel fresh and current. I have to say this: even though I’ve only seen Michael through videos (and I agree with my mom that he was one of the greatest performers of all time), BE:FIRST’s version is incredible. Their vocals? Absolutely stunning.\n\nI’m a fan of both K-pop and J-pop, and I honestly think BE:FIRST is such a standout group. Are they considered idols? How popular are they in Japan? I noticed on Spotify they’ve got close to **2 million monthly listeners** — which is massive, especially considering that top Japanese boy groups often only have around half a million. With talent like this, I have to assume they’re extremely popular and maybe even household names in Japan.\n\nSo how big are they really in the Japanese music scene?",

I thought it was Becky but it is not, I think.\n\nShe seemed to have come out of no where (to me) I remember her single being posted in Livejournal MP3 sharing groups and I'd never heard of her. The single was of her with really long hair and I think there were balloons or something? Maybe her eyes were closed?? Confetti? i can't fully remember.\n\nBut I DO remember she was a very good singer and people were talking about how she sang in whistle register - the song was a ballad i think and one of the first few words/notes was in the high note.\n\nI feel like she had a non Japanese name?",

    "content": "Hello all! I am traveling to Japan for the first time in a week (US). Coincidentally, a few weeks ago I happened to discover a Japanese band named Maverick Mom. I instantly loved them - just the type of music I loved (but in Japanese). I then happened to discover that even further coincidentally, they are playing at a music festival in the area I have had a hotel booked for months (Shimokitazawa) at the Knockout FES festival.  \n  \nHonestly, may sound cheesy, but felt like destiny or something. Instantly decided that I had to go. Plus, tickets were only $25 USD? Easy money. \n  \nAnyway, I’m not new to live music or even festivals at all but I obviously AM new to this genre, the country, live music in Japan, etc. I can’t think of a better way to experience the culture than through listening to local bands with locals.  \n  \nMy questions are… Anything I should know? What should I expect? Any norms I should be aware of? This type of festival where bands kind of take over venue throughout the city vs just like festival grounds is something new to me… but very cool. Can I just kind of bounce around from one place to the next? Anyway, I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has been to this festival or anything similar here and has anything to share about it or advice to give.  \n  \nThanks!",

He sang so well, but it seems like the video got deleted — maybe because it showed him opening a bottle of liquor. I checked his profile and it looks like he’s an artist; in the video, he was singing while opening a small yellow bottle of whiskey. He’s Japanese.

    "content": "I’ve been imagining Perfume’s JPN Tour stage transplanted into arenas across North America or  Europe or china.For this experiment I’m using the Budokan style version with a single central runway instead of the left and right catwalks seen in other JPN Tour stops.\nThe reason Budokan only had one runway is pretty simple the venue is smaller so adding side catwalks would have made the stage cramped and complicated for both performers and audience. Single runway setups make the show safer easier to manage and still deliver that signature Perfume energy.\nIf the JPN Tour had gone global it’s fun to think about how this single runway stage would feel in a bigger arena. Would it still give the same impact or would side catwalks be necessary to reach the crowd?\nI’m planning to drop this stage into an arena map to see how it works. Perfume fans and stage design enthusiasts what do you think?",

    "content": "Lately I’ve been diving into the deep corners of Perfume’s history and it got me wondering just how much lost media might exist from their long career. For a group that’s been active since the early 2000s and evolved through so many eras there must be moments that slipped through the cracks TV appearances that never re aired demo tracks that never made it to an album or tour footage that vanished between edits.\nI’ve seen fans mention a few things over the years rumored alternate versions of music videos early indie era performances from Hiroshima that only aired locally and even talk of songs that were cut from live shows before release. It’s wild to think how much might still be sitting somewhere on a forgotten hard drive or in a broadcast vault.",

And those are not available anywhere even on Spotify and YouTube.\nLooked it up on google, nothing came up.\nMost of them are only available in physical cd and then most of them does not ship to my country.\n\nAnd forget to mention that their video contents are pretty hard to find lol, like some videos were from 3-4 years ago with no english subtitle and all.\nIt's kinda frustrating.\n\nEDIT: I hope this does not offend anyone. I'm just new to this 🙂",

    "content": "Looks like someone hacked Sayuri’s spotify account, or maybe credited her under the song to farm engagement. Maybe they were also trying to credit a different sayuri but it chose the wrong artist. \n\nIm not too sure about how the crediting works on spotify but i assume you would need mutual consent from all parties. If this is really a case of hacking to use her following as a platform to boost their streams, then its just deplorable and a stain on her legacy. \n\nIm only assuming its hacking because it’s happened to TUYU’s account before to re-release their deleted pony canyon affiliated songs. \n\nIf anyone has a better insight on this please do enlighten me 🙏",

I found those songs on YouTube but I don’t know if she is also releasing physical copies of them too. Finding info about her is kinda hard, maybe because she is not that popular. And the reason I am saying this is because the last 15 songs was released really weirdly. Like 5 at a time. some of the are too different from others and two of them sounds different than others.",

    "content": "Hi! I never posted here before and I apologise if this isn't the right place to ask, but I got this song I listened to years ago and can't find it again.\n\nI first found this song around 2015-2016 on YouTube while looking for songs to put on my iPod. It didn't contain the title of the song other than \"Cute Japanese song\" \"Cute Jpop song\" (Or along the lines of). The video isn't on YouTube anymore.\n\nHere is what I can remember:\n\n- The hook/beginning (?) of the song has the female singer saying some random words, something like \"Konyo nya nyo nyo nyo\" and then an \"Oh!\" At the end.\n\n- Upbeat, happy sounding, dance/electro? Had a semi-fast beat.\n\n- The female singer sings the beginning and hook while the male raps the middle parts, the singer even intercepts during some of it (Few words I remember her saying simply \"Arigatou!\" \"Honto ni?\" \"Honto desu ka?\")\n\n- After the 2nd hook, there's a part where they sing together and the first part sounding like \"My best friend\". Either English or a mishearing of Japanese words.\n\n- I remember the thumbnail had the girl singer on it. She was a burnette/brownhair and she had her hair up (Either in a ponytail or pigtails?). I think she wore yellow?\n\n- Considering I found the video 2015-2016, the song likely came out 2000s or early 2010s.\n\nThat's sadly all I can remember since this was nearly a decade ago, I'm also terrible at describing music. Any help is appreciated.",

The background was all white and video has no other major accent visuals and focused on her singing during the haircut. \n\nI roughly remember the lyrics maybe starting with “boku ne—“ (?). I could be wrong with this part since it was so long ago. The title of the YouTube video was “Japanese Haircut” so it hasn’t been easy trying to find the video.",

    "title": "Why is J-pop still so hesitant to tour Europe?",
    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’ve been wondering: why don’t we see more J-pop concerts overseas, especially from artists under Sony and its subsidiaries? (I focus on j-pop, but extensive to j-music)\n\nEven as artists like Aimer gain international popularity, Japanese labels seem hesitant to promote them abroad. For example, Aimer performed at AnimagiC in Germany in 2022, Ito Kashitaro was there this year, and ClariS was scheduled for the 2024 edition. Has anyone attended these events? Were they well-attended? If demand exists, why aren’t Japanese labels taking advantage?\n\nSigning with Sacra Music suggested that artists like Aimer might get more international exposure, but overseas touring is still limited. In Paris, anime-related events sell out instantly, fans sing along to OSTs, watch AMVs, and organize anime-themed parties. Europe clearly has an enthusiastic audience ready for J-pop.\n\nEven Kenshi Yonezu’s European tour wasn’t directly promoted by Sony : it was handled by Live Nation. Why isn’t the label itself more involved?\n\nJapanese music influenced East Asia before Korea’s Hallyu wave, yet Japanese labels didn’t develop the same global strategies, even with initiatives like the Cool Japan plan. Are they afraid of high costs, lacking infrastructure, or simply too conservative?\n\nI’m curious: do you think the J-pop international scene could grow if labels took more risks? Would you attend concerts if your favorite artists came to Europe? Do you think we, as fans, could somehow help build momentum for more overseas tours?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts, experiences and ideas !",

To the point where for every \"cour\" I've come up with an OP/ED theme I've taken from various series, other artists I've liked, etc. (I ask my players stuff about \"what is your character doing in X situation / what's their action scene\" and then do an \"animation\"... by which I mean we just use our imagination)\n\nWe're coming up on the last act, and while I have my OP set, I am just blanking on a good ED! And I was hoping I could get some recommendations.\n\nFor context, the vibe is similar to [Gundam 00's \"Trust You\"](https://youtu.be/qVS8NNi12Tg), in that the \"animation\" is about the end of combat, exhaustion, what happens after the war, etc. This doesn't mean that I need the song to sound like this, that's just what's going on.\n\nI'd love something that's got a lot of feeling to it, and especially one that has a really good *drop*. I'm seriously open to any artists, genre, so if anything comes to mind, lay it on me!\n\n(if you're curious as to my taste thus far, [these](https://i.imgur.com/z4up1TC.png) are what I've used as the existing OPs/EDs for the past 7 arcs, but I'm seriously open to new stuff)",

I discovered them years ago when I was in high school cause they did an ending for the Hitman Reborn anime. I wanted to \"diversify\" my taste at the time cause I was like \"hmmm am boy but listen lot girl music, should change\" and lo and behold my closeted self walked right into the open jowls of jpop and kpop, mainly through boy bands. The ones I kept up with to varying degrees were BIGBANG, w-inds and of course, Lead. I was kinda obsessed 😆 My favorites were Shinya and Keita and this was cememented in the ギラギRomantic era when I listened to their solos ONLY! I remember Hiroki leaving cause he felt like he wasn't moving at the same pace professionally as the other members (?) But I think after that I feel the fuck off. Here I am tonight, high af and chilling in the bath and I see that they JUST dropped something! So I'm like yea let's check it out! I liked it a lot! I feel like their sound seems consistent with what it was back when i was really into them and I like that. It's always a bop with them. I feel like 真夏のMagic is their hit that never quit or something cause I heard it come up in This Love is Perfect and Roller Coaster reminds me a LOT of SPEED STAR and it was so much fun! Listening to them again after so many years made me feel like I was 18 blasting Baby, What Turns You On. It felt like a great hug from an old friend, you know? I see that Roller Coaster the album is about to drop, so I'll have to check it out! What about y'all? Any other Lead fans? Who's your favorite member and what's your top 5 songs?",

In another song she's doing (a kind of) rapping.\n\nI would describe the sound as pretty sunny and upbeat, with horns in the mix as well.\n\nI think the name was something like 'generation' or 'class of x'.\n\nHope this rings a bell for anyone!",

There’s some b-roll footage dispersed throughout the video of the artist too, which is a new thing I’ve been trying with the last few videos and really love the results. \n\nDo any of you have a j-pop journal??

To do this you can choose idols or artists from different agencies, such as Avex, Universal, Starto, Tobe, BMSG, Underground, etc.\n\nIt can be a boy group, a girl group, or a mixed group, and you can create the name if you want. That's up to you, but there are a couple of rules to follow.\n1. You can only choose two people per agency.\n2. The group has a maximum of 5 members.\n3. You can only choose group members, not soloists.\n\nEnjoy.",

I just came to the sharp realization that anisong is J-pop but the stuff I thought was popular was slightly niche than mainstream J-pop.\n\nSpeaking of ILLIT, they're having a Glitter Day/fan event in Japan right now, and I just checked out a recent video where they did a whole bunch of J-pop covers, and [Wonhee](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/REqVbuaEYsE) covered Momoiro Kataomoi; checked out the original and absolutely LOVED it. I was wondering if I could get some similar recommendations! I don't have many 2000's J-pop songs in my playlist as I'm a 2010s anime watcher\\~\n\nThanks!

His debt exceeded 10 million yen (\\~$65k).\n* Despite his wife’s pleas to stop, he refused: *“This is my only reason to live. If I quit, I have nothing left.”*\n* He eventually quit his job, his family collapsed, and his phone revealed idol DMs and fan rivalries fueled by money and bragging rights.\n\nThis story is trending in Japan right now. It comes from a counseling case described by a psychiatrist: the man said his marriage had never been romantic, and he felt like idol fandom was helping him “reclaim the youth” he had missed out on.  \nI think a lot of people can relate to this story because we’ve all seen adults who seem dead set on reclaiming things they never had the chance to.\n\nSource: [https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/da8959eb7cb470ed90f827958f254d4bb4d7a548?page=3](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/da8959eb7cb470ed90f827958f254d4bb4d7a548?page=3)",

    "content": "Since it unlikely I will ever be able to see a concert from my favorite performers in Japan, I have been happily collecting DVD's and (more recently) Blu-rays of live performances for many years. For many performers, I feel the live performances bring out extra dimensions in their music. Currently, Zutomayo is a great example.\n\nI have mostly bought the DVD's etc from CDJapan. They have a great collection, the website is pretty good and I have been very satisfied with their customer service. I have also picked up a few from Japanese dealers on Ebay. But now thanks to changes in de minimus packages, the shipping which was never cheap, will go to completely unbearable.  Before, I was paying about $30 shipping for a normal order. Now it looks like there will be an additional $ 30-50 for each package.\n\nSo may question does anyone have recommendations for places in US where I could find a good selection of imported music and videos.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAt CDJapan, the earlier chaos has subsided and the result is more palatable. It seems like (based on their info), that the tariff on CD's etc is 0%. The shipping costs are about what they were before \\~ $25 for a shipment and they don't automatically increase the shipping costs for each item. FedEx is adding 1300 Yen for customs handling. CDJapan was having a 1500 Yen promotion, so pretty much a wash. \n\nSo I took advantage and ordered the new Aimyon concert Blu-Ray and the newest Zutomayo concert Blu-Ray:\n\n Aimyon / AIMYON TOUR 2024-25 \"Dolphin Apart\" IN OSAKA-JO HALL \\[Limited Edition\\]\n\n Zutto Mayonaka de Iinoni. / Authentic Chinese Cafe - Love Pegasus -Love's Spicy Dragon- (Honkaku Chuka Kissa Ai no Pegasus -Rabu no Koshinryo-) \\[Regular Edition\\]",

They both handled every step of the production, from writing the lyrics and picking the melody to choosing which members would perform the song. The two songs were then released anonymously, and fans were given the chance to vote on which one they liked more.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the AI's song, \"Omoide Scroll,\" beat out Akimoto's own song, \"Cecil.\" As a result, the AI-produced track was officially released digitally as AKB48's new song. The outcome was a huge shock to everyone, including former AKB48 member and producer Rino Sashihara, while Akimoto himself looked visibly disappointed.\n\nThis event is likely to be a historic precedent, marking the first time a mainstream J-POP musician has competed against and been defeated by an AI.",

I see it was originally released on the “Anzenchitai V” by that band where Koji Tamaki was the lead singer.\n\nThe trouble is, I’d like to access a high definition recording of that song by the original performer, either Anzenchitai or Koji Tamaki. The strange thing is that song as performed by Anzenchitai or Koji Tamaki is not available on Apple iTunes or Spotify. Neither the Anzenchitai V album nor any Koji Tamaki album with that song is available for purchasing online or download. I don’t know whether it is available on Amazon Music because I don’t have a subscription, and don’t really want to take out a subscription just to check. \n\nDoes anyone have any knowledge as to why this is so?",

As a foreigner outside Japan who loves pop music of any language, I was suprised with this fact thru this subreddit as I never heard of their music until 5 years ago.\nI don't know the reason why they are more famous than AKB here in Japan: is it there songs are better or are the idols better looking?\n\nOutside Japan, even if the person is not an otaku, or not a fan of Japanese culture, they can mention 1 AKB song. Megahits like Fortune Cookie and Heavy Rotation are mostly their answer. Heck, even Bruno Mars sang a snippet of Heavy Rotation.\n\nThis is what I meant about representative song which I find none in Sakamichi discography.\nIt's not about the type of music you enjoy, it's about the cultural impact of a song to the general public.\n\nP.S.: I'm not a fan nor a hater of both groups, but I liked some of their songs. I'm just curious why AKB is not popular but the song is still bangers while Sakamichi are top idols but snoozefest music in the perspective of a person who likes pop music outside Japan.",

Why not “Bink’s Sake”? Why translate at all? How tf am I supposed to find a song from title? I had to learn JP to guess it?? \n\nThis is a rant btw. I just don’t like unorganised things like this lol\n\nIdk this seems like a recent trend I noticed, especially on Spotify. I guess it’s because jpop is much more accessible now so they thought translating the title would make it easier to non-JP speakers to consume. I had to learn JP myself for 20+ years purely from exposure just to read them 😅",

    "content": "My mom was born in 1970, and she once told me: the first time she watched Michael Jackson sing and dance on stage, she thought she was seeing a performance king. No joke.\n\nBE:FIRST just dropped their cover of *I Want You Back* — originally by The Jackson 5 — and they added their own flavor to make it feel fresh and current. I have to say this: even though I’ve only seen Michael through videos (and I agree with my mom that he was one of the greatest performers of all time), BE:FIRST’s version is incredible. Their vocals? Absolutely stunning.\n\nI’m a fan of both K-pop and J-pop, and I honestly think BE:FIRST is such a standout group. Are they considered idols? How popular are they in Japan? I noticed on Spotify they’ve got close to **2 million monthly listeners** — which is massive, especially considering that top Japanese boy groups often only have around half a million. With talent like this, I have to assume they’re extremely popular and maybe even household names in Japan.\n\nSo how big are they really in the Japanese music scene?",

I discovered it a few months ago, and today when I went to relisten I found out it has been taken off of streaming in the US. It’s kind of obscure, so I’ve been scouring the internet for a way to download it and all I can find is a low quality rip on youtube. Does anyone know a good way to bypass reigon-locking? It seems to be available in Japan still on Apple Music",

Here is a little information about TEAM NIVA:\n\nWe are a passionate but small team, currently only 3-4 people (I am trying to gather more). We work with eachother, because we believe that teamwork is better then working alone. \n\nCurrently we focus on our series, which is called \"Solitary In Snow\". Solitary In Snow is an anime style Open World RPG about a young teenage boy named Seedy that fights demons.\n\nWhat I am looking for In a music composer:\n\nI am looking for someone who is experienced in making Emo (Emptional) J-pop. For vocals, we will probably either use vocaloid or any other voice synth, but if you are good at singing, thats great too. \n\nI will provide reference music you can listen to, to get an idea of what kind of music I need.\n\nContact method: it is preferable that you contact me on discord. My discord is: seedy_.\n\nIf you are unable to contact me on discord then you can make a comment on this post or message me on reddit normally.",

The single was of her with really long hair and I think there were balloons or something? Maybe her eyes were closed?? Confetti? i can't fully remember.\n\nBut I DO remember she was a very good singer and people were talking about how she sang in whistle register - the song was a ballad i think and one of the first few words/notes was in the high note.\n\nI feel like she had a non Japanese name?",

I've been trying to beat it, or atleast listen to something as addicting as that song is for about a year now, but I haven't come across anything yet. I'm attaching a link to my playlist as well. Some of my songs may not be the happiest, I just like sad songs. Thank you very much to any and everyone who recommends a song!!\n\nTL;DR : Song recommendations similar to Gekijyou, sad or such.",

    "content": "Hello all! I am traveling to Japan for the first time in a week (US). Coincidentally, a few weeks ago I happened to discover a Japanese band named Maverick Mom. I instantly loved them - just the type of music I loved (but in Japanese). I then happened to discover that even further coincidentally, they are playing at a music festival in the area I have had a hotel booked for months (Shimokitazawa) at the Knockout FES festival.  \n  \nHonestly, may sound cheesy, but felt like destiny or something. Instantly decided that I had to go. Plus, tickets were only $25 USD? Easy money. \n  \nAnyway, I’m not new to live music or even festivals at all but I obviously AM new to this genre, the country, live music in Japan, etc. I can’t think of a better way to experience the culture than through listening to local bands with locals.  \n  \nMy questions are… Anything I should know? What should I expect? Any norms I should be aware of? This type of festival where bands kind of take over venue throughout the city vs just like festival grounds is something new to me… but very cool. Can I just kind of bounce around from one place to the next? Anyway, I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has been to this festival or anything similar here and has anything to share about it or advice to give.  \n  \nThanks!",

He sang so well, but it seems like the video got deleted — maybe because it showed him opening a bottle of liquor. I checked his profile and it looks like he’s an artist; in the video, he was singing while opening a small yellow bottle of whiskey. He’s Japanese. If anyone still has that video saved, please share it with me. 3kyuu",

    "content": "I’ve been imagining Perfume’s JPN Tour stage transplanted into arenas across North America or  Europe or china.For this experiment I’m using the Budokan style version with a single central runway instead of the left and right catwalks seen in other JPN Tour stops.\nThe reason Budokan only had one runway is pretty simple the venue is smaller so adding side catwalks would have made the stage cramped and complicated for both performers and audience. Single runway setups make the show safer easier to manage and still deliver that signature Perfume energy.\nIf the JPN Tour had gone global it’s fun to think about how this single runway stage would feel in a bigger arena. Would it still give the same impact or would side catwalks be necessary to reach the crowd?\nI’m planning to drop this stage into an arena map to see how it works. Perfume fans and stage design enthusiasts what do you think?",

    "content": "Lately I’ve been diving into the deep corners of Perfume’s history and it got me wondering just how much lost media might exist from their long career. For a group that’s been active since the early 2000s and evolved through so many eras there must be moments that slipped through the cracks TV appearances that never re aired demo tracks that never made it to an album or tour footage that vanished between edits.\nI’ve seen fans mention a few things over the years rumored alternate versions of music videos early indie era performances from Hiroshima that only aired locally and even talk of songs that were cut from live shows before release. It’s wild to think how much might still be sitting somewhere on a forgotten hard drive or in a broadcast vault.",

I only found that their old music are only on a compilation album? And they're just the greatest hits. Other than that,just this year's releases.\nWhen I look em up on the internet, they got over 100+ songs including unit and solo songs. And those are not available anywhere even on Spotify and YouTube.\nLooked it up on google, nothing came up.\nMost of them are only available in physical cd and then most of them does not ship to my country.\n\nAnd forget to mention that their video contents are pretty hard to find lol, like some videos were from 3-4 years ago with no english subtitle and all.\nIt's kinda frustrating.\n\nEDIT: I hope this does not offend anyone. I'm just new to this 🙂",

If this is really a case of hacking to use her following as a platform to boost their streams, then its just deplorable and a stain on her legacy. \n\nIm only assuming its hacking because it’s happened to TUYU’s account before to re-release their deleted pony canyon affiliated songs. \n\nIf anyone has a better insight on this please do enlighten me 🙏",

    "content": "Hi! I never posted here before and I apologise if this isn't the right place to ask, but I got this song I listened to years ago and can't find it again.\n\nI first found this song around 2015-2016 on YouTube while looking for songs to put on my iPod. It didn't contain the title of the song other than \"Cute Japanese song\" \"Cute Jpop song\" (Or along the lines of). The video isn't on YouTube anymore.\n\nHere is what I can remember:\n\n- The hook/beginning (?) of the song has the female singer saying some random words, something like \"Konyo nya nyo nyo nyo\" and then an \"Oh!\" At the end.\n\n- Upbeat, happy sounding, dance/electro? Had a semi-fast beat.\n\n- The female singer sings the beginning and hook while the male raps the middle parts, the singer even intercepts during some of it (Few words I remember her saying simply \"Arigatou!\" \"Honto ni?\" \"Honto desu ka?\")\n\n- After the 2nd hook, there's a part where they sing together and the first part sounding like \"My best friend\". Either English or a mishearing of Japanese words.\n\n- I remember the thumbnail had the girl singer on it. She was a burnette/brownhair and she had her hair up (Either in a ponytail or pigtails?). I think she wore yellow?\n\n- Considering I found the video 2015-2016, the song likely came out 2000s or early 2010s.\n\nThat's sadly all I can remember since this was nearly a decade ago, I'm also terrible at describing music. Any help is appreciated.",

It’s a song that carries their resolve, their passion, and the weight of everything they’ve faced to get here.\n\n“PROOF” is my answer to that. It’s a song born from pride — our pride — for everything Ae! group has become, and everything they continue to be. It’s also a song of gratitude, for the light they’ve given us through their journey, and of resolve, to keep walking alongside them as they chase even bigger dreams.\n\nEvery lyric carries the voice of someone who has watched them fight, stumble, rise, and shine — someone who has been inspired by their unwavering spirit. It’s a promise: we’ll keep believing, no matter the distance, no matter the unknowns ahead.\n\nBecause being here, together, in this moment — Sharing the same sky, the same beat, the same dream — That’s already proof enough.",

    "title": "Why is J-pop still so hesitant to tour Europe?",
    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’ve been wondering: why don’t we see more J-pop concerts overseas, especially from artists under Sony and its subsidiaries? (I focus on j-pop, but extensive to j-music)\n\nEven as artists like Aimer gain international popularity, Japanese labels seem hesitant to promote them abroad. For example, Aimer performed at AnimagiC in Germany in 2022, Ito Kashitaro was there this year, and ClariS was scheduled for the 2024 edition. Has anyone attended these events? Were they well-attended? If demand exists, why aren’t Japanese labels taking advantage?\n\nSigning with Sacra Music suggested that artists like Aimer might get more international exposure, but overseas touring is still limited. In Paris, anime-related events sell out instantly, fans sing along to OSTs, watch AMVs, and organize anime-themed parties. Europe clearly has an enthusiastic audience ready for J-pop.\n\nEven Kenshi Yonezu’s European tour wasn’t directly promoted by Sony : it was handled by Live Nation. Why isn’t the label itself more involved?\n\nJapanese music influenced East Asia before Korea’s Hallyu wave, yet Japanese labels didn’t develop the same global strategies, even with initiatives like the Cool Japan plan. Are they afraid of high costs, lacking infrastructure, or simply too conservative?\n\nI’m curious: do you think the J-pop international scene could grow if labels took more risks? Would you attend concerts if your favorite artists came to Europe? Do you think we, as fans, could somehow help build momentum for more overseas tours?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts, experiences and ideas !",

To the point where for every \"cour\" I've come up with an OP/ED theme I've taken from various series, other artists I've liked, etc. (I ask my players stuff about \"what is your character doing in X situation / what's their action scene\" and then do an \"animation\"... by which I mean we just use our imagination)\n\nWe're coming up on the last act, and while I have my OP set, I am just blanking on a good ED! And I was hoping I could get some recommendations.\n\nFor context, the vibe is similar to [Gundam 00's \"Trust You\"](https://youtu.be/qVS8NNi12Tg), in that the \"animation\" is about the end of combat, exhaustion, what happens after the war, etc. This doesn't mean that I need the song to sound like this, that's just what's going on.\n\nI'd love something that's got a lot of feeling to it, and especially one that has a really good *drop*. I'm seriously open to any artists, genre, so if anything comes to mind, lay it on me!\n\n(if you're curious as to my taste thus far, [these](https://i.imgur.com/z4up1TC.png) are what I've used as the existing OPs/EDs for the past 7 arcs, but I'm seriously open to new stuff)",

    "content": "Didn't know where else to put this cause I haven't seen a Lead subreddit and I JUST discovered this one so I'm curious 🤔 Any long time Lead fans out there? I discovered them years ago when I was in high school cause they did an ending for the Hitman Reborn anime. I wanted to \"diversify\" my taste at the time cause I was like \"hmmm am boy but listen lot girl music, should change\" and lo and behold my closeted self walked right into the open jowls of jpop and kpop, mainly through boy bands. The ones I kept up with to varying degrees were BIGBANG, w-inds and of course, Lead. I was kinda obsessed 😆 My favorites were Shinya and Keita and this was cememented in the ギラギRomantic era when I listened to their solos ONLY! I remember Hiroki leaving cause he felt like he wasn't moving at the same pace professionally as the other members (?) But I think after that I feel the fuck off. Here I am tonight, high af and chilling in the bath and I see that they JUST dropped something! So I'm like yea let's check it out! I liked it a lot! I feel like their sound seems consistent with what it was back when i was really into them and I like that. It's always a bop with them. I feel like 真夏のMagic is their hit that never quit or something cause I heard it come up in This Love is Perfect and Roller Coaster reminds me a LOT of SPEED STAR and it was so much fun! Listening to them again after so many years made me feel like I was 18 blasting Baby, What Turns You On. It felt like a great hug from an old friend, you know? I see that Roller Coaster the album is about to drop, so I'll have to check it out! What about y'all? Any other Lead fans? Who's your favorite member and what's your top 5 songs?",

In another song she's doing (a kind of) rapping.\n\nI would describe the sound as pretty sunny and upbeat, with horns in the mix as well.\n\nI think the name was something like 'generation' or 'class of x'.\n\nHope this rings a bell for anyone!",

Thought I’d share my latest J-pop journal video in my Journal With Me series for those who enjoy j-pop and journaling. :) Many people enjoyed my post the last time a few months ago so thought I’d share this one too (though I do one each month, I don’t want to spam by posting too regularly lol). \n\nThese videos are a mix of journal with me and podcast-type content, with me talking about the artist the video is focused on, creating the journal spread, and other things related to jpop while you watch me put the spread together. There’s some b-roll footage dispersed throughout the video of the artist too, which is a new thing I’ve been trying with the last few videos and really love the results. \n\nDo any of you have a j-pop journal?? I feel like k-pop journals are super common but not so much j-pop ones. :(\n\nVideo here: https://youtu.be/0xbSPriP9Ic",

I really like Twice, Gfriend, and ILLIT, but without J-pop, I don't think I would've liked them as much! I just came to the sharp realization that anisong is J-pop but the stuff I thought was popular was slightly niche than mainstream J-pop.\n\nSpeaking of ILLIT, they're having a Glitter Day/fan event in Japan right now, and I just checked out a recent video where they did a whole bunch of J-pop covers, and [Wonhee](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/REqVbuaEYsE) covered Momoiro Kataomoi; checked out the original and absolutely LOVED it. I was wondering if I could get some similar recommendations! I don't have many 2000's J-pop songs in my playlist as I'm a 2010s anime watcher\\~\n\nThanks!

    "content": "**The tragic fate of a middle-aged man who fell too deep into “oshi-katsu” (idol fandom):**\n\n* A 51-year-old section manager at a major manufacturer, married with kids, was invited by a colleague to a local idol concert.\n* The moment he shook hands with an idol, who he didn't think was that attractive, he thought *“Is this what youth feels like?”* and got hooked. \n* He began commuting weekly from Kansai to Tokyo by shinkansen, draining his savings, then borrowing from loan sharks. His debt exceeded 10 million yen (\\~$65k).\n* Despite his wife’s pleas to stop, he refused: *“This is my only reason to live. If I quit, I have nothing left.”*\n* He eventually quit his job, his family collapsed, and his phone revealed idol DMs and fan rivalries fueled by money and bragging rights.\n\nThis story is trending in Japan right now. It comes from a counseling case described by a psychiatrist: the man said his marriage had never been romantic, and he felt like idol fandom was helping him “reclaim the youth” he had missed out on.  \nI think a lot of people can relate to this story because we’ve all seen adults who seem dead set on reclaiming things they never had the chance to.\n\nSource: [https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/da8959eb7cb470ed90f827958f254d4bb4d7a548?page=3](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/da8959eb7cb470ed90f827958f254d4bb4d7a548?page=3)",

I’ve tried exploring through song radios, but I can’t quite find what I’m looking for.\n\nI’d like to find more music similar to *Neon wo Keshite* by Chilldspot or *Sun &amp; Moon* by Sheena Ringo and Hikaru Utada, as well as Sheena Ringo’swork in general. I really want to discover more songs like *Neon wo Keshite* because that balance of chill and groove is exactly what I’m trying to explore further.\n\nFor reference, here are some songs and albums I really enjoy:[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisei_F%C5%ABzoku)\n\nNeon wo keshite- Chilldspot\n\nHeart Jack - Neon wo keshite\n\nSun &amp; Moon - Sheena Ringo &amp; Hikaru Utada\n\neverything from Heisei Fūzoku (Album) -Sheena ringo\n\nEverything from *Kyōiku* (Album) - Tokyo Jihen\n\nMy preferred genres are jazz pop, alternative rock, indie pop, and anything similar to Sheena Ringo, but I’m open to recommendations outside of these genres as well. I’ve basically lived under a rock listening to the same 3 artist since ever,\n\nI apologize if this post is a bit messy. This is my first time making a post like this.

    "title": "where to buy DVD and Blu-ray",
    "content": "Since it unlikely I will ever be able to see a concert from my favorite performers in Japan, I have been happily collecting DVD's and (more recently) Blu-rays of live performances for many years. For many performers, I feel the live performances bring out extra dimensions in their music. Currently, Zutomayo is a great example.\n\nI have mostly bought the DVD's etc from CDJapan. They have a great collection, the website is pretty good and I have been very satisfied with their customer service. I have also picked up a few from Japanese dealers on Ebay. But now thanks to changes in de minimus packages, the shipping which was never cheap, will go to completely unbearable.  Before, I was paying about $30 shipping for a normal order. Now it looks like there will be an additional $ 30-50 for each package.\n\nSo may question does anyone have recommendations for places in US where I could find a good selection of imported music and videos.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nAt CDJapan, the earlier chaos has subsided and the result is more palatable. It seems like (based on their info), that the tariff on CD's etc is 0%. The shipping costs are about what they were before \\~ $25 for a shipment and they don't automatically increase the shipping costs for each item. FedEx is adding 1300 Yen for customs handling. CDJapan was having a 1500 Yen promotion, so pretty much a wash. \n\nSo I took advantage and ordered the new Aimyon concert Blu-Ray and the newest Zutomayo concert Blu-Ray:\n\n Aimyon / AIMYON TOUR 2024-25 \"Dolphin Apart\" IN OSAKA-JO HALL \\[Limited Edition\\]\n\n Zutto Mayonaka de Iinoni. / Authentic Chinese Cafe - Love Pegasus -Love's Spicy Dragon- (Honkaku Chuka Kissa Ai no Pegasus -Rabu no Koshinryo-) \\[Regular Edition\\]",

They both handled every step of the production, from writing the lyrics and picking the melody to choosing which members would perform the song. The two songs were then released anonymously, and fans were given the chance to vote on which one they liked more.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the AI's song, \"Omoide Scroll,\" beat out Akimoto's own song, \"Cecil.\" As a result, the AI-produced track was officially released digitally as AKB48's new song. The outcome was a huge shock to everyone, including former AKB48 member and producer Rino Sashihara, while Akimoto himself looked visibly disappointed.\n\nThis event is likely to be a historic precedent, marking the first time a mainstream J-POP musician has competed against and been defeated by an AI.",

The strange thing is that song as performed by Anzenchitai or Koji Tamaki is not available on Apple iTunes or Spotify. Neither the Anzenchitai V album nor any Koji Tamaki album with that song is available for purchasing online or download. I don’t know whether it is available on Amazon Music because I don’t have a subscription, and don’t really want to take out a subscription just to check. \n\nDoes anyone have any knowledge as to why this is so?",

    "content": "There's a song called CUTE DEPRESSED and it's a blatant remix of Lost Umbrella by Inabakumori and another song I think. And there's another one called IN MY MIND which is a remix of Hysterical Night Girl.\n\n\nBoth remix does not credit the original song, and it's truly disgusting because the original artists probably worked really hard just for some random lazy person to use it without permission and speed up a little add some shit and call it their song\n\n\nIdk if this is a small problem or not but I feel like it's a problem that should be addressed",

As a foreigner outside Japan who loves pop music of any language, I was suprised with this fact thru this subreddit as I never heard of their music until 5 years ago.\nI don't know the reason why they are more famous than AKB here in Japan: is it there songs are better or are the idols better looking?\n\nOutside Japan, even if the person is not an otaku, or not a fan of Japanese culture, they can mention 1 AKB song. Megahits like Fortune Cookie and Heavy Rotation are mostly their answer. Heck, even Bruno Mars sang a snippet of Heavy Rotation.\n\nThis is what I meant about representative song which I find none in Sakamichi discography.\nIt's not about the type of music you enjoy, it's about the cultural impact of a song to the general public.\n\nP.S.: I'm not a fan nor a hater of both groups, but I liked some of their songs. I'm just curious why AKB is not popular but the song is still bangers while Sakamichi are top idols but snoozefest music in the perspective of a person who likes pop music outside Japan.",

    "content": "Me personally, I've really been stuck on that Soul-Groove feeling you get from a lot of emotive and acoustic-laden pop nowadays. I've noticed an increase in songs that draw from things like Gospel music (Harpsichord, Choruses) and Laid-Back Lo-Fi influences (like a resurgence in tributes to Nujabes).\n\nBetween that and my usually territory of Funk and RnB flavored music (SUCHMOS, Go!Go!Vanillas, BRADIO, Lucky Kilimanjaro, PENTHOUSE) I've also wandered into Japanese Christian RnB (Kvi Baba), mellow Hip Hop/RnB (SIRUP, idom, tio ago, YO-SEA) and 'Songs about life' style melancholic pop mixed with familiar RnB backbeats (iri, Claquepot, Mukai Taichi, LUCKY TAPES).\n\nIf if break away from that at all, it's usually for high-energy Hip-Pop (SKRYU, s\\*\\*t kings) or Voice-Actor centered comedy/meme music (Hypnosis Mic, Charisma House, Everyday Players).\n\nWhat have ya'll been listening to?",

Why not “Bink’s Sake”? Why translate at all? How tf am I supposed to find a song from title? I had to learn JP to guess it?? \n\nThis is a rant btw. I just don’t like unorganised things like this lol\n\nIdk this seems like a recent trend I noticed, especially on Spotify. I guess it’s because jpop is much more accessible now so they thought translating the title would make it easier to non-JP speakers to consume. I had to learn JP myself for 20+ years purely from exposure just to read them 😅",

    "content": "My mom was born in 1970, and she once told me: the first time she watched Michael Jackson sing and dance on stage, she thought she was seeing a performance king. No joke.\n\nBE:FIRST just dropped their cover of *I Want You Back* — originally by The Jackson 5 — and they added their own flavor to make it feel fresh and current. I have to say this: even though I’ve only seen Michael through videos (and I agree with my mom that he was one of the greatest performers of all time), BE:FIRST’s version is incredible. Their vocals? Absolutely stunning.\n\nI’m a fan of both K-pop and J-pop, and I honestly think BE:FIRST is such a standout group. Are they considered idols? How popular are they in Japan? I noticed on Spotify they’ve got close to **2 million monthly listeners** — which is massive, especially considering that top Japanese boy groups often only have around half a million. With talent like this, I have to assume they’re extremely popular and maybe even household names in Japan.\n\nSo how big are they really in the Japanese music scene?",

Here is a little information about TEAM NIVA:\n\nWe are a passionate but small team, currently only 3-4 people (I am trying to gather more). We work with eachother, because we believe that teamwork is better then working alone. \n\nCurrently we focus on our series, which is called \"Solitary In Snow\". Solitary In Snow is an anime style Open World RPG about a young teenage boy named Seedy that fights demons.\n\nWhat I am looking for In a music composer:\n\nI am looking for someone who is experienced in making Emo (Emptional) J-pop. For vocals, we will probably either use vocaloid or any other voice synth, but if you are good at singing, thats great too. \n\nI will provide reference music you can listen to, to get an idea of what kind of music I need.\n\nContact method: it is preferable that you contact me on discord. My discord is: seedy_.\n\nIf you are unable to contact me on discord then you can make a comment on this post or message me on reddit normally.",

The single was of her with really long hair and I think there were balloons or something? Maybe her eyes were closed?? Confetti? i can't fully remember.\n\nBut I DO remember she was a very good singer and people were talking about how she sang in whistle register - the song was a ballad i think and one of the first few words/notes was in the high note.\n\nI feel like she had a non Japanese name?",

I instantly loved them - just the type of music I loved (but in Japanese). I then happened to discover that even further coincidentally, they are playing at a music festival in the area I have had a hotel booked for months (Shimokitazawa) at the Knockout FES festival.  \n  \nHonestly, may sound cheesy, but felt like destiny or something. Instantly decided that I had to go. Plus, tickets were only $25 USD? Easy money. \n  \nAnyway, I’m not new to live music or even festivals at all but I obviously AM new to this genre, the country, live music in Japan, etc. I can’t think of a better way to experience the culture than through listening to local bands with locals.  \n  \nMy questions are… Anything I should know? What should I expect? Any norms I should be aware of? This type of festival where bands kind of take over venue throughout the city vs just like festival grounds is something new to me… but very cool. Can I just kind of bounce around from one place to the next? Anyway, I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has been to this festival or anything similar here and has anything to share about it or advice to give.  \n  \nThanks!",

Vào xem profile thì  hình như là hoạ sĩ, vừa hát vừa khui chay whiskey loại nhỏ màu vàng ý. Thanh niên ấy là người Nhật luôn. Ai còn giữ cho mình xin với nhé\n\nI’m not sure if anyone still has that cover of “One Love” by Arashi from that guy on TikTok. He sang so well, but it seems like the video got deleted — maybe because it showed him opening a bottle of liquor. I checked his profile and it looks like he’s an artist; in the video, he was singing while opening a small yellow bottle of whiskey. He’s Japanese. If anyone still has that video saved, please share it with me. 3kyuu",

    "content": "I’ve been imagining Perfume’s JPN Tour stage transplanted into arenas across North America or  Europe or china.For this experiment I’m using the Budokan style version with a single central runway instead of the left and right catwalks seen in other JPN Tour stops.\nThe reason Budokan only had one runway is pretty simple the venue is smaller so adding side catwalks would have made the stage cramped and complicated for both performers and audience. Single runway setups make the show safer easier to manage and still deliver that signature Perfume energy.\nIf the JPN Tour had gone global it’s fun to think about how this single runway stage would feel in a bigger arena. Would it still give the same impact or would side catwalks be necessary to reach the crowd?\nI’m planning to drop this stage into an arena map to see how it works. Perfume fans and stage design enthusiasts what do you think?",

    "title": "Are There Any Lost Media or Unreleased Footage from Perfume?",
    "content": "Lately I’ve been diving into the deep corners of Perfume’s history and it got me wondering just how much lost media might exist from their long career. For a group that’s been active since the early 2000s and evolved through so many eras there must be moments that slipped through the cracks TV appearances that never re aired demo tracks that never made it to an album or tour footage that vanished between edits.\nI’ve seen fans mention a few things over the years rumored alternate versions of music videos early indie era performances from Hiroshima that only aired locally and even talk of songs that were cut from live shows before release. It’s wild to think how much might still be sitting somewhere on a forgotten hard drive or in a broadcast vault.",

I only found that their old music are only on a compilation album? And they're just the greatest hits. Other than that,just this year's releases.\nWhen I look em up on the internet, they got over 100+ songs including unit and solo songs. And those are not available anywhere even on Spotify and YouTube.\nLooked it up on google, nothing came up.\nMost of them are only available in physical cd and then most of them does not ship to my country.\n\nAnd forget to mention that their video contents are pretty hard to find lol, like some videos were from 3-4 years ago with no english subtitle and all.\nIt's kinda frustrating.\n\nEDIT: I hope this does not offend anyone. I'm just new to this 🙂",

If this is really a case of hacking to use her following as a platform to boost their streams, then its just deplorable and a stain on her legacy. \n\nIm only assuming its hacking because it’s happened to TUYU’s account before to re-release their deleted pony canyon affiliated songs. \n\nIf anyone has a better insight on this please do enlighten me 🙏",

    "content": "Hi! I never posted here before and I apologise if this isn't the right place to ask, but I got this song I listened to years ago and can't find it again.\n\nI first found this song around 2015-2016 on YouTube while looking for songs to put on my iPod. It didn't contain the title of the song other than \"Cute Japanese song\" \"Cute Jpop song\" (Or along the lines of). The video isn't on YouTube anymore.\n\nHere is what I can remember:\n\n- The hook/beginning (?) of the song has the female singer saying some random words, something like \"Konyo nya nyo nyo nyo\" and then an \"Oh!\" At the end.\n\n- Upbeat, happy sounding, dance/electro? Had a semi-fast beat.\n\n- The female singer sings the beginning and hook while the male raps the middle parts, the singer even intercepts during some of it (Few words I remember her saying simply \"Arigatou!\" \"Honto ni?\" \"Honto desu ka?\")\n\n- After the 2nd hook, there's a part where they sing together and the first part sounding like \"My best friend\". Either English or a mishearing of Japanese words.\n\n- I remember the thumbnail had the girl singer on it. She was a burnette/brownhair and she had her hair up (Either in a ponytail or pigtails?). I think she wore yellow?\n\n- Considering I found the video 2015-2016, the song likely came out 2000s or early 2010s.\n\nThat's sadly all I can remember since this was nearly a decade ago, I'm also terrible at describing music.
