Snoop Dogg. It’s that short repeating sound — kind of like “E-E-E” or “ey-ey-ey” — that plays right before the beat drops.\n\nI’ve heard the same sound in a bunch of other beats, so I’m guessing it comes from a sample pack or classic synth (maybe Spectrasonics or Roland?).\n\nDoes anyone know exactly what that sample is called or which library/preset it comes from? 🙏\n\n(Some forums mention “MEXFEMALE5” or “Vocal Planet,” but I’m not 100% sure if that’s correct.)",

It’s a place where hope dies—only to be resurrected by a fix of a broken promise.  \n  \nWhat the promise, you ask? A promise of a better tomorrow.  \n  \nYou see, my higher conscience told me never to lose sight of my vision, and to stay on board with my mission until Reality Takes Its Shape. Discipline is key—especially for artists at war with themselves.  \n  \nBut once the war is won, and the coast is clear, room is made for the birth of a new reality. Even better, a new world.  \n  \nA world that’s yours. So take a trip through my mind’s eye.  \n  \nSincerely, Yao Nabi aka Yaolvin Cambridge",

    "content": "The track \"Molecules\" from the new album from Eye Said So featuring Warcloud.\n\nAustin-based duo **Eye Said So** announces the release of their most ambitious project to date: *In The Woods Lurks Who?*, a genre-defying hip-hop/rock hybrid featuring Wu-Tang Clan affiliate **Warcloud aka The Holocaust**, arriving **August 29, 2025**.\n\nThe album is both a personal triumph and a heartbreaking farewell. Produced and recorded during a period when founding member **Sach** battled Stage 4 cancer, the project took shape with the help of Producers, associates and collaborators who could bring the elusive Warcloud into the project. Fellow Wu-Tang Killa Bee **Christ Bearer of NorthStar** also contributed, reuniting with Warcloud for the first time in years.\n\nBut in December 2024, two life-altering events collided: Sach completed treatment and was declared cancer-free, while Warcloud (Anthony Creston Brown) tragically passed away.\n\n“This record could have been the final Eye Said So release,” says Sach. “Instead, it became a way to celebrate survival while also honoring Warcloud’s legacy. It’s the record we always dreamed of making with him.”\n\nThe result is a raw, unpredictable, and deeply emotional record that merges hip-hop beats, industrial textures, heavy guitars and experimental production with Warcloud’s esoteric flows, an album true to Eye Said So’s self-coined “schizo-rock” ethos: *all the music we love, sometimes in the same song.*\n\n*In The Woods Lurks Who?* is more than an album, it’s a strange journey into the unknown, a tribute to resilience, and a final showcase of Warcloud’s unmatchable lyrical world.",

It’s a diss anthem and anti-industry track built around chant-hooks and layered vocals. 80 BPM pocket, raw energy, no features, no apologies.\n\nThe whole idea was flipping the glamour of the word pop star into something cracked and counterfeit — fake crowns, fake jewels, fake fame. The hook stacks (“I hate that you’re a star…”) give it that mob-chant feel, and the verses tear at how repetitive and hollow the game’s gotten.\n\nIt’s the lead track off my 3-song POP STAR (EP) on SoundCloud. If you like underground, diss-driven rap with grit over polish, this one’s for you.",

    "content": "Does Boom Bap still hit your soul — or is it just nostalgia talking?\n\nLately I’ve been thinking: is Boom Bap really timeless… or are we just clinging to a sound that feels safe?\nI still make raw, sample-based beats on the MPC — not because I’m anti-modern, but because it feels right.\nThere’s a swing, a soul in those chopped-up samples and knockin’ drums that most modern stuff just doesn’t have.\nBut I also get that tastes evolve. Maybe to some ears, this sound is just “vintage cosplay.”\n\nSo I’m asking honestly:\nWhat still makes Boom Bap powerful to you in 2025?\nAnd what (if anything) needs to evolve for it to stay relevant?\n\nDrop thoughts, memories, or even links — I’d love to hear how others keep the spirit alive.",

Produced with a modern touch. \n\nFor me, the MPC is therapy. There’s something about chopping a dusty sample and layering it with raw drums that clears my head like nothing else.\nCurious what tools or habits keep you grounded in this sound?\n\nWould love to hear how y’all keep that boom bap spirit going – whether you’re producing, rapping, DJing, collecting vinyl or just listening deep.",

While the UN remains silent on the issue of whether the United States’ mental health laws are, by the UN’s definition, perpetuating a genocide against people who hear voices, Flannery is not:\n\nTechnically, it’s not the United States’ mental health laws. It’s the states of the United States. Or, you might say, the lowercase united states. The mental health laws causing this genocide are not federal laws at all; they are state laws. Every single state. And they can all go —\n\nAre we not all so impressed by our little laureate-in-training for managing to make it through this press release without cursing or singling out his home state of Connecticut? I know this reporter couldn’t be more proud.\n\n###",

Anyway, Viktum announced on Facebook one day that the sample was from a very rare Cambodian rock record (hence the title of his track), and refused to let anyone know the name of the song. However, on the YouTube upload of '4/17/1975' on channel MrSuicideSheep, fans of the track discovered the original record, of which this track samples. The original, rare Cambodian track is by a singer called Ros Sereysothea, and it is called 'Kon Komsott (កូនកំសត់)', which translates to 'Sad Child'. You can find it here: http://www.khmeroldies.org/track/kon-komsot. I am posting this because I feel as a hip hop enthusiast, and an artist, this track deserves to come to light. You can't keep a masterpiece to yourself. Thanks.",

Snoop Dogg. It’s that short repeating sound — kind of like “E-E-E” or “ey-ey-ey” — that plays right before the beat drops.\n\nI’ve heard the same sound in a bunch of other beats, so I’m guessing it comes from a sample pack or classic synth (maybe Spectrasonics or Roland?).\n\nDoes anyone know exactly what that sample is called or which library/preset it comes from? 🙏\n\n(Some forums mention “MEXFEMALE5” or “Vocal Planet,” but I’m not 100% sure if that’s correct.)",

It’s a place where hope dies—only to be resurrected by a fix of a broken promise.  \n  \nWhat the promise, you ask? A promise of a better tomorrow.  \n  \nYou see, my higher conscience told me never to lose sight of my vision, and to stay on board with my mission until Reality Takes Its Shape. Discipline is key—especially for artists at war with themselves.  \n  \nBut once the war is won, and the coast is clear, room is made for the birth of a new reality. Even better, a new world.  \n  \nA world that’s yours. So take a trip through my mind’s eye.  \n  \nSincerely, Yao Nabi aka Yaolvin Cambridge",

    "content": "The track \"Molecules\" from the new album from Eye Said So featuring Warcloud.\n\nAustin-based duo **Eye Said So** announces the release of their most ambitious project to date: *In The Woods Lurks Who?*, a genre-defying hip-hop/rock hybrid featuring Wu-Tang Clan affiliate **Warcloud aka The Holocaust**, arriving **August 29, 2025**.\n\nThe album is both a personal triumph and a heartbreaking farewell. Produced and recorded during a period when founding member **Sach** battled Stage 4 cancer, the project took shape with the help of Producers, associates and collaborators who could bring the elusive Warcloud into the project. Fellow Wu-Tang Killa Bee **Christ Bearer of NorthStar** also contributed, reuniting with Warcloud for the first time in years.\n\nBut in December 2024, two life-altering events collided: Sach completed treatment and was declared cancer-free, while Warcloud (Anthony Creston Brown) tragically passed away.\n\n“This record could have been the final Eye Said So release,” says Sach. “Instead, it became a way to celebrate survival while also honoring Warcloud’s legacy. It’s the record we always dreamed of making with him.”\n\nThe result is a raw, unpredictable, and deeply emotional record that merges hip-hop beats, industrial textures, heavy guitars and experimental production with Warcloud’s esoteric flows, an album true to Eye Said So’s self-coined “schizo-rock” ethos: *all the music we love, sometimes in the same song.*\n\n*In The Woods Lurks Who?* is more than an album, it’s a strange journey into the unknown, a tribute to resilience, and a final showcase of Warcloud’s unmatchable lyrical world.",

It’s a diss anthem and anti-industry track built around chant-hooks and layered vocals. 80 BPM pocket, raw energy, no features, no apologies.\n\nThe whole idea was flipping the glamour of the word pop star into something cracked and counterfeit — fake crowns, fake jewels, fake fame. The hook stacks (“I hate that you’re a star…”) give it that mob-chant feel, and the verses tear at how repetitive and hollow the game’s gotten.\n\nIt’s the lead track off my 3-song POP STAR (EP) on SoundCloud. If you like underground, diss-driven rap with grit over polish, this one’s for you.",
