    "content": "Feels like a lot of people in the classical world want tonal music to make a real comeback — stuff that’s new but still melodic and harmonic. Any post-1980 composers doing that kind of thing? I know about people like Pärt and maybe John Adams, but I’m curious if there’s a newer wave I’ve missed.\n\n  \nI am aware that the question and description are very vague, but it would take a long time to explain fully what are all the elements in romantic and pre-romantic music that people miss so much.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!",

    "content": "My favorite piece of music is the Dance of the Blessed Spirits by Gluck. The wandering, aimless melody is so otherworldly and amazing that it could have been written today and it would still be moving. I don’t know if it has been used in a film, but if it was, I can definitely see it in some sort of post-modern, oblique film that plays as the main character wanders around, wondering what to do with their life, just like the melody.",

As a complete outsider, this looked like a source of tension, for better or worse, and I'm curious whether it is accepted that they work that way hierarchically. He was leaning in towards them, clearly taking the lead, but their body language was not accepting or.reciprocal, not at all. Why?\n\nI'm fascinated where musician's eyes tend to get their information from - the conductor, the page, or one another. The uniformity and cohesion is what we typically honor in these performances but the tension is what makes it work. Who is pushing whom? Who indulges an equal over a leader? \n\nSome appear to do it peripherally, if I'm not mistaken, and are able to do that quite effectively, while others are clearly biased towards a single source or information, in terms of tempo and feeling. \n\nHow do they do that? Are some 1st Vs more controlling than others? Really, I'm curious about what a musician might say about what is on camera that otherwise might be private.\n\nCheers.",

A good example is danse macabere, but that still sound a bit to happy for my liking. I would also like for the clarinet to be the most important instrument, because I play it. And it doesnt really matter to me if it is an Orchestral, quintet, solo, etcetera. arrangement. Oh and I want the piece to end in a climax\n\nThe movie plot is in short:\nMe(a) and my friends(b+c) go to the forest where we are taking a look at the site where b's parents are planning on destroying the forest to build homes. When we get there we like do some teen stuff like littering, breaking twigs, throwing rocks, etc. because the forest is getting destroyed anyway. But then A finds a notebook with sheetmusic. Then everybody goes home, A starts playing her new sheetmusic on her clarinet and finds out she is musch better at it than usualy. But what she doesnt know is that the music she found is from an ancestor who becomes 'alive' and takes her form(A²) when A plays the music and haunts her and her friens because she doenst like the destroying of her forest. \n(Im gonna skip al the middle parts and go to the end) (the folllowing bit is where I want the music piece for)\nSo B and C go to the forest, A doenst wanna go and goes home and plays her clarinet (activating A²) so when B and C enter the forest they catch a glimpse of A² sort of eerily dancing (thats why im looking for a waltz, but an other sort is also fine as long as its kinda dancable) to A's music (that plays in the background while the camera switches between A, A², and B C. But when B and C notice A², she dissapears, so B and C look at each other and look back at the forest, they see A² again so they look back at each other and then at the forest again, but then A² has come a lot closer. So they are both quite scared, but B doesnt want to acknowledge it because he thinks thats not cool. But C tells B she wants to go home and tells him that she is going if he wants to or not. So C jumps on her bike and pedals away when she notices she gets stuck in a loop and cant bike away, every direction she tries, but she keeps ending up in the same spot, so she kinda flips. B decides to stay but A² gets to him and curses him, finally she snaps his neck, at the same time C gets out of the loop and A stops playing the clarinet.",

I'd like to create a play list of popular works, performed by some of the best artists, that are fairly sedate for easing into the first two-hours of the day.\n\nI have a lot of Bach and Chopin already (Goldberg Variations, Cello Suites- 6 versions, Rubinstein's Complete Chopin Collection). I love Chopin's Nocturnes but don't want to wear them out. I need more Mozart, and otherwise I'm open to various composers. Who has the best recording of the Mozart Clarinet Concertos? Caveat- I'm a semi-audiophile, so I prefer quality recordings. So if a few of you wouldn't mind listing a handful of your favorites, I'd be greatly appreciative. Thank you-",

Complementing these cinematic works, the program also presents an intimate musical setting of Poe’s lesser-known poem, *Evening Star*, and his seminal poem, *The Raven*.\n\n\n\n**Curiosity Cabinet** is a chamber music collective whose performances blur the boundaries between spectacle and satire, inviting audiences into a compelling drama of sound, imagery, and gesture that encourages attentive listening and active viewing. Founded in 2009 by composer Whitney George, the Curiosity Cabinet’s interdisciplinary programming champions new works by living composers. Among the ensemble’s accolades are the Elebash Award for the premiere of Miriam Gideon’s opera *Fortunato* (2019), the CUNY Graduate Center’s prestigious Robert Starer Award for George’s orchestral work *The Anatomy of the Curiosity Cabinet*, and the Robert Engelman Award for the premiere performance of George’s monodrama *The Yellow Wallpaper*.

Here are a few I received:\n\n* The music is emotional\n* The music is fun (because of evolution of ideas / because there is interesting counterpoint / because there are cool timbres)\n* The music evokes strong imagery (doesn't have to be programmatic)\n* The music has personality\n* The music is digestible\n\nThese answers ranged from person to person, but a common answer I got was \"the music has personality\" which I find super interesting. I'm super interested in starting a discussion on not what necessarily makes a \"good composer\", but exploring why we just passionately love certain pieces of music!",

A master of orchestration and sonic color, he created new forms such as the program symphony (*Symphonie fantastique*), the symphonic poem, and orchestral song, along with bold choral innovations and a visionary use of spatial effects.\n\nHis influence stretches from Liszt and Wagner to Mahler, Ravel, Debussy, and Stravinsky.

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nLately, I’ve been listening to more classical music  symphonies, concertos, and string quartets  and I realized that I don’t just want to hear the music. I want to *understand* it.\n\nI mean, I want to know the story behind each work what inspired the composer, what emotions or events shaped the piece, or even what historical context surrounds it. I feel like understanding that story would help me connect more deeply with the music and feel what the composer wanted to express.\n\nFor example, knowing that Beethoven’s Symphony No. 3 (“Eroica”) was originally dedicated to Napoleon, orthat Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 (“Resurrection”) explores themes of death, doubt, and spiritual rebirth after loss, makes the experience completely different.\n\nSo my question is where do you usually find this kind of background or “story” information?  \nAre there any websites, books, YouTube channels, or podcasts that explain the meaning, context, or emotional story behind classical compositions in a way that’s both informative and engaging?\n\nI’d love to build a list of resources or methods to explore classical works more deeply, so any recommendation would be appreciated.\n\nThanks a lot!",

    "title": "Brahms's 4th Symphony premiered today in 1885. Why was it so controversial?",
    "content": "On October 25, 1885, Brahms conducted the premiere of his fourth and final symphony. It's a piece that I deeply admire, and its backstory is just as compelling as the music itself. While the audience in Meiningen was appreciative—even demanding an encore of the third movement—the critical world was immediately split into two warring camps.\n\nIt's hard to imagine now, but figures like Hugo Wolf, a staunch Wagnerian, were scathing. Wolf famously dismissed the symphony as \"contentless and void.\" Even Mahler seems to have had his reservations. To them, Brahms was looking backward, clinging to old forms while Wagner and Liszt were forging the future of music.\n\nBut then there's the other side. The influential critic Eduard Hanslick championed its originality. Fascinatingly, a young Richard Strauss, supposedly playing the triangle at the premiere, was completely won over. In a letter to his father, Strauss raved about the piece's \"immense ideas and genius structure,\" a surprising reaction from someone we associate with the more \"progressive\" side of music.\n\nSo, what was all the fuss about?\n\nI believe it boils down to the finale, the monumental passacaglia. Drawing on a theme from a Bach cantata, Brahms based his conclusion on a Baroque form. To his critics, this was the ultimate proof of his \"academic\" nature. They saw it as a retreat and a failure of imagination.\n\nHowever, I view it as an act of incredible artistic courage. Brahms wasn't merely dusting off an old relic; he was demonstrating that these ancient structures could support the weight of modern Romantic expression. He demonstrated that tradition is not a dead end but a deep well of inspiration.\n\nThis is what makes the Fourth so powerful for me. It's a testament to the idea that looking back can be a radical act. It's a work that sparked the eternal debate in art: tradition versus innovation.\n\nHere is a legendary performance that captures all that fire and intellectual depth.\n\nBrahms's Symphony No. 4, conducted by Carlos Kleiber with the Vienna Philharmonic.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxB5vkZy7nM\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Fourth? Do you hear it as a conversation with the past or as something else entirely?",

    "content": "Today (Oct 25th) is the 200th birthday of Johann Strauss II. His waltzes represent the joy and spirit of Europe.\n\nFor me, however, \"The Blue Danube\" will always be associated with a time of profound fear: Karajan's sole New Year's concert in 1987.\n\nThe year before, the Chernobyl disaster had occurred. Watching the news from my home in Japan was terrifying. I was truly and painfully afraid that Europe, home to the music I loved, was coming to an end.\n\nI had that feeling when I watched the concert. As was his style, Karajan conducted with his eyes closed. Then, the camera showed his face. He was smiling.\n\nIt wasn't just a smile of joy. To my anxious eyes, it looked like the smile of a man who had accepted everything. A man who knew the world might be ending and had decided to face it with this final, beautiful waltz. He wasn't showing any sadness. He was just smiling. And that was what broke my heart.\n\nOf course, this was just how I felt, colored by my own fears. I don't know what Karajan was actually thinking. But what I saw in his smile that day was real to me.\n\nThankfully, the world did not end. Europe is still here. However, I will always remember that smile whenever I hear this waltz. It reminds me of how fragile beautiful things can be and of the quiet strength it takes to face the unknown.\n\n— Herbert von Karajan, \"The Blue Danube\" (New Year's Concert, 1987)  \n[https://youtu.be/y8Rgg3g14SM?si=InB\\_g1Xf2IDXI0FM](https://youtu.be/y8Rgg3g14SM?si=InB_g1Xf2IDXI0FM)",

I was formally introduced to Odin, Loki, and the Norse gods; the Saga to Sigurd, Brynhild, and the cursed ring that inspired Wagner’s plot. Seeing the complex drama in the short amount of reading I did compared to the depth of those epics, and after seeing the length of Der Ring Des Nibelung, I knew I had quite the journey in front of me. After a few weeks of working through The Ring Cycle, I found myself craving more after it was done. So I enlisted chatgpt to give me the top 20 most greatest and influential operas of all time. Out of the 20, I've listened to about a dozen or so and about half of those I listen to all the time.  Tosca, Rigoletto, Norma, Turandot, L'elisir d'amore and Pagliacci are my absolute favorites and while I do enjoy the others like Don Giovanni, Barbiere Di Siviglia, Das Rheingold, La Boheme and Il Trovatore, it seems I'm not a huge fan of Singspiel or Classic Recitivos. What does this say about my taste in operas (be nice) and what are some of stories you've enjoyed?",

Nevertheless, I tried to incorporate stylistic elements that are perceived as typically medieval today: parallel fifths and fourths, use of church modes (especially Phrygian), 6/8 time, dotted rhythms, constant pulse of quarter and eighth notes, stepwise progression, root-heavy harmonies, etc.  \n  \nFrom a music history perspective, very little of this is actually authentic, but that wasn't my intention. The main focus was on the effect. I'd be interested to hear what you think about it. :)",

    "content": "OK so first of all, I’m a classical musician with a doctorate in piano performance. I’ve been around the competition scene for years, I’ve performed in, won, and even judged quite a few music competitions around the world. Recently I stumbled on a site called [**musicalchairs.info**](http://musicalchairs.info), and honestly, at first it looked totally harmless. Just another site listing competitions and opportunities for musicians, right? But after spending a bit more time on it, I realized something really sketchy was going on.\n\nI noticed that they don’t list *any* real, established competitions. Not one. So I started digging deeper. I checked out more than 100 of the competitions they had posted, and the deeper I went, the more obvious it became: they’re all basically run by the same people behind the site itself. They’re not actually listing competitions, they’re *creating fake ones*.\n\nAnd the names… my god. Stuff like *“15th Bach International Music Competition,” “World Melody Music Competition,” “Universal Stars Music Competition,”* and *“Golden Prestige Music Competition”* (seriously???). It’s like they picked random impressive-sounding words to trick students who are trying to build their portfolios. They also use composer names like Mozart, Beethoven, Dvořák, etc. to look legitimate. It’s honestly one of the biggest scams I’ve ever seen in the classical world.\n\nThen I started noticing the technical side. Every single one of these “competitions” uses the same website template, same layout, same design, same hosting platform, literally copy-paste jobs. They charge about **$220 per entry**, and the “prize” is usually just a cheap medal and probably to all participants to make them participate and pay the fee again. No actual judging, no performances, no public announcements, nothing. Their Instagram pages are filled with fake followers and bots, zero comments, zero likes, completely dead engagement.\n\nWhat’s worse is how they constantly recycle these competitions every month or even every few weeks, each with new “deadlines” to create fake urgency. It’s all just to squeeze more money out of desperate young musicians and parents. It’s disgusting.\n\nAs someone who’s spent their life in this field, this makes me furious. Musicians already struggle enough financially, and seeing people exploit that passion is just gross. I’m seriously planning to report them to authorities in the **US, UK, EU, and China**, and I’m also looking into going after their **payment processors and domain hosts**. There’s a real pattern of fraud here.\n\nHas anyone else here had experiences with these fake competitions or lost money to them? I think the more we talk about it and share real experiences, the harder it’ll be for these scammers to keep taking advantage of people in the music community.",

The melodies are timeless and deeply nostalgic.\n\nIf you've ever been hesitant to explore contemporary music, this piece is the perfect introduction.\n\nLuciano Berio — Folk Songs (performed by Cathy Berberian)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZ6vFw8alc\n\nWhat's your favorite work by Berio? Are there other contemporary pieces you've found to be surprisingly beautiful and melodic?",

Was looking mainly at Vienna Philharmonic (would have been my top choice but they won’t be playing during the time we’re there) or Vienna State Opera (Hansel &amp; Gretel is the only one during that time) and I think dad would really enjoy classical music rather than operas. We’ve been to two classical concerts together now but I would say he’s more on the beginners side but really appreciates good performances and the beauty of the venue too. Would love any recs!

    "content": "I got rejected from the classical performance course for my instrument that I was working towards for the past 6 years. It’s been my only goal my whole life, and as expected the audition went really well and I was genuinely so proud of how the audition went. I know the principal lecturer as I have met him before, and he listened the whole way through for both my audition pieces instead of cutting them off, etc.\n\nUnfortunately I couldn’t audition in the first round of auditions earlier this year as I had a memorial on that date, so I had to apply for the second round three months later. \nA lot of early offers were already made before the second round of auditions even happened. This worried me, however I still remained hopeful and put in my all for my audition. \n\nI recently got the email that my audition was unsuccessful, meaning there are no spots for me. What now? I have nothing else I want to do or even considered other than studying music in university, and now I just got rejected. \nI can’t even guarantee my final school marks would be that good for any other university course as I spent all my free periods at school practising my instrument instead of studying etc. The conservatorium was my only option and dream. \n\nWould it even be worth trying to email the lecturer/admin and ask if there are any possibilities for a late offer/vacancies or should I just give up? \n\nI know this sounds immature and pathetic but I am so desperate and really want to pursue further studies in classical music and am just so disappointed and in denial over the results, as other teachers from the conservatorium I know all reassured me that with my level, getting into the conservatorium was pretty much a given, which never turned out to be true. \n\n+I live in Australia and there is only one conservatory in each state",

    "content": "I recently came across this album by Josep Colom and was incredibly impressed by the quality of his playing. I've been listening to classical music for over 20 years and feel that I have a pretty good gauge of what a \"good\" player sounds like. I’m wondering if the performance on this album stands out to anyone else. \n\nJosep Colom was unknown to me until I heard this album, and it appears that he is not particularly well known (I searched this subreddit and his name only came up once, in a post from 10 years ago). I'm curious to know why someone who plays at this caliber is not better known, or if my judgment of exceptional playing isn’t particularly sharp, and this is just another standard piano album that will eventually be lost to time.\n\nThe album consists of selections from Mozart Piano Sonatas and includes interludes of his own making. I'm not particularly interested in the interludes, although I do find them pleasing to the ear. My main interest is in the sonatas themselves. The *Allegro* from Sonata No. 13 in B-flat Major really stood out to me. For one, it's just a beautiful piece of music; and second, the expressiveness of the performance is stunning.\n\nI don’t claim to be an expert on classical music, just a person who enjoys listening. I’d be especially curious to hear the opinion of someone who has played piano for a long time and really understands the nuance of elite-level performance.\n\n[https://open.spotify.com/album/4gt8LhQ9mT0IvxVolEjuTo?si=mB7Cr25eQmSZCgXtkwwADQ](https://open.spotify.com/album/4gt8LhQ9mT0IvxVolEjuTo?si=mB7Cr25eQmSZCgXtkwwADQ)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4c22uwl0zwf1.png?width=1114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84b43af15348e3ac3fd553096aaf399faf138baa",

I am organizing an evening of meetings and presentations. Those who planned to come did not come, those who didn’t answer anything came (a few). I then start a first rehearsal: almost no one responds. on site almost no one came except the more or less beginner musicians looking for an orchestra to progress. the few good-level musicians that there were left due to the slowness of some musicians who left themselves. Being an educational orchestra and having myself an atypical background, I hesitate to recruit my first musicians on 'audition'. What do you think of auditions recruitment?

It's the second movement (Largo) from Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3. \n\n(I also posted this in r/HelpMeFind, but I figure this is an easier place to ask. Since that post, i have listened to countless concertos and have still not found it!)\n\nEarlier this year, during one of the harder times in my life, I was put in jail for something I didn't do, and suffered a lot due to my mental conditions. There was one thing that helped me come out of that, and it is a recording I've never been able to find.\nWhile I was in there, they gave me a shitty iPod to listen to radio stations and use paid texting services. Aside from the radio stations, they also had several free public domain recordings and government documents to listen to/view on the iPod. \nOne of them was a recording of an orchestral arrangement, labeled. \"Classical Relaxation\". It was about 10 to 12 minutes long. It was potentially the most beautiful thing I've ever heard, and was the only thing able to calm psychosis episodes spawning from my medication not being given to me. \nThe recording began with only piano. It reminded me a lot of Frederic Chopin's compositions, (but I checked, and neither of his orchestral arrangements were what I want. ) After about 3 minutes of just piano, the entire remainder of the strings orchestra comes in at once and floods the piano sound in a massive wave. If there was a choir, it was kind of minimal.\nThat's all I can remember. Please, as someone still struggling with these same psychosis attacks, it would mean the absolute world to me if anyone could help me find this recording. Thank you.",

    "content": "(Updated crosspost from r/vinyl,  post-sorting.)\n\nI fell into a crazy stash of vintage vinyl at a local used record store last weekend. 💿\n\nI was flipping through some unsorted classical LPs, and the guy behind the counter was like *\"I haven't gotten around to sorting those... I can't really move the classical stuff. If you want that whole stack, you can have it for $40.\"*\n\nI thought he probably meant the 12\" high stack of loose unsorted records on top, but I asked \"You mean the box under it, too?\" He said, *\"No, the whole stack all the way to the ground.\"* Then I noticed the ones I was looking through were piled on top of a bunch of closed cardboard boxes that were ALSO full of classical LPs.\n\nLong story short, if you count the fact that I was also buying five $5 records and he gave me the whole carload for $50... I suddenly became the owner of ***SEVEN MOVING BOXES*** full of vintage classical vinyl for basically ***$25***.\n\nI had a lot of fun over the next three days digging through it all and sorting it into keep, gift, sell, and donate piles. Obviously there's quite a bit of thrift store quality stuff in there — the ubiquitous Mantovani Orchestra and Mormon Tabernacle Choir. There are a few oddballs in addition to the classical music. (Five LPs of bagpipe music, and three of Welsh folk songs.) There is a lot of music that doesn't appeal to me and that I'm not likely to spin on the turntable.... baroque organ music... \"Gregorian Chants for Christmas\"... a really weird amount of solo flute stuff. But roughly 1/3 of it is orchestral stuff I'm genuinely interested in. Six or 7 Mahler symphonies. A Solti Beethoven symphonies boxed set. Lots of piano - mostly Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Some Bernstein I don't know but I'm interested in giving a spin. Lots of Brahms and Bruckner. Some opera that I'll gift to a friend of my daughter. A lot of the \"good\" stuff is in absolutely pristine, near mint condition. I suspect that many of the records have only left their sleeves once or twice in 40-50 years.\n\nIt will definitely be a \"project\" to get through it and even listen to everything ONCE. This may be the impetus I need to install a turntable/hi-fi system in my office on campus in addition to the one at home.\n\nWe were having a yard sale this weekend anyway, and I'm going to try to sell a little bit of it in $5 bundles so I can make $25 and then say I got it all for free!",

It’s labeled “School Music Hour – WXYZ – Cass Technical High School” and contains a WWII memorial broadcast honoring Cass Tech’s 161 Gold Star alumni. The program opens with the announcer dedicating it “to those who fought and died for a new world of permanent peace,” followed by the Cass Tech Orchestra performing Dvořák’s “New World Symphony” (Finale).\n\nAudio plays clearly (with the usual 1940s crackle) and the label lists WXYZ and United Sound Systems at 5840 Second Blvd. I’ve verified the date and speech match post-V-E-Day Detroit broadcasts.\n\nFrom what I can tell, this might be the only surviving copy of that broadcast — possibly recorded as an internal reference or archival transcription.\n\nHas anyone seen similar Detroit Public Schools / WXYZ acetates from the 1940s? Or know if Cass Tech’s music archives or the Detroit Historical Society might hold another copy?\n\nI’d love any info on how these broadcasts were produced or archived, and whether this kind of school memorial program was typical for the era.

    "content": "**Context:**\n\nI've been playing since I was a kid (\\~10 years), took some years off of lessions, and now I'm getting back into it on my own terms.\n\nIn terms of repertoire: I have Rach prelude c# minor op. 3 no. 2 and Alla Turca Jazz arrangement (Fazil Say not Yuja's) mastered, proficient playing level of Etude op. 10 no. 12 (technique is there, its just a rough piece).\n\nRight now I'm learning Chopin Waltz Op. 64 no. 2, took me like 8 total hours to get comfortable with the notes, still not smooth and haven't finished interpretation. Also working on Liebestraum No. 3 right now, similar story, trying to bring the notes up to speed.\n\nTechnique wise, I use hell (Hanon) 1-10 just for basics and Etude op. 10 no.1 for arpeggios at like half speed-ish (no way I can play it at full speed).\n\nAlso, I have been messing around with Ballade no. 3 for fun and I can read through and play most of it, but I definitely can't bring it to concert speed\n\n**Question:**\n\n**So what I want to know is, what should I learn next? I want to hear your thoughts.**\n\nWhat would my level be classified as? What are some pieces at and above my level?\n\nI was thinking of pieces like Nocturne op. 48 no. 1, maybe a polonaise or chopin prelude, maybe Mozart Twinkle variations, Rach paganini var. 18 (though it seems ridiculous on first pass).\n\nKeep in mind my musical range is pretty limited XD. I know everything I learned is in the late romantic era, but something about that music clicks with me interpretation wise much more than other periods. Plus I personally just think they sound better (sorry bach lovers).\n\nAlso: how do you guys smooth pieces out? It's one thing to learn the notes but another to get them smoothed out, I kind of just brute force playing sections over and over until I get it. It works, just doesn't seem efficient.",

Eventually, I figured out that it was similar to the chorus in Bach's Cantata *Schauet doch und sehet, ob irgend ein Schmerz sei*, BWV 46 (which Bach later reworked for the *Qui tollis* section of his Mass in B Minor).\n\nDornel's work (timestamp at 0:36):  \n[Sonate en quatuor: III. Gravement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HemepUI6gig&amp;t=36s)\n\nBach's Cantata chorus (timestamp at 0:51)  \n[Schauet doch und sehet ob irgendein Schmerz sei, BWV 46: I. Coro. Schauet doch und sehet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo3O7zYYzLU&amp;t=51s)\n\nIt's not exactly the same but definitely quite harmonically similar. The Dornel work was first published in 1709 and Bach's Cantata was first performed in 1723. I don't know if Bach was familiar with Dornel or ever had any exposure to his music. Maybe it's simply a coincidence that they sound somewhat alike. Anyway, just a curiosity.",

Then I can hear Fauré, who was 5, in the minor/major transformation of the theme and the rumbling piano under the melody. I'm thinking of the second piano quartets of both composers in particular. I can hear also echoes of Robert Schumann, looking backward rather than forward. Could Fanny Mendelssohn be a link between them? It seems possible that Brahms knew the piece, given the Schumanns' close friendships with both him and the Mendelssohns, not so sure about Fauré.",

    "content": "Some years ago, ore-pandemic, my partner and I were in Bergen, Norway for a music festival. There was lots to go and see/hear and it was an excellent few days.\n\nDuring the festival we popped in to a performance by what we understood to be students of the local music school/college. It was the cheapest of the concerts we saw and might even have been free. We have been looking for the music that was performed there since with no luck. It was hard to understand exactly what was performed when as they announced in Norwegian but we're sure that one piece was a percussion duet composed by Bartok? Does that sound likely and if so could it be a study piece for students that has never been recorded? Or is it more likely that the piece was adapted by the duo and we've missed a nuance in how the piece came about?\n\nIt sounded very modern then and was hugely entertaining as the players had to move about between many percussion instruments. Other pieces were performed by other students: there was a piece for deconstructed trumpet for instance. This wasn't an amateurish event; they must have been students performing ahead of becoming professionals. I'd like any help in finding the music or a recording of it. Failing that a general conversation about what happens at these kinds of events might be interesting and some idea of exactly how much \"high standard\" music written by celebrated/famous composers never gets recorded.\n\nEDIT: Distracted idiocy.",

He is best known for his Songs of the Auvergne, a beautiful collection of folk songs from his native region that he arranged.\n\nFor years, Frederica von Stade's version of the famous \"Baïlèro\" has been my personal favorite. It was the first one I ever heard, and it has stuck with me ever since. Of course, I've known about Netania Davrath's legendary recording for a long time. But listening to it again today, on Canteloube's birthday, I was struck anew by its power. From the very first shadowy notes of the accompaniment, I was captivated. When her voice began, the tears just started flowing. It's a profound experience.\n\nHere is that recording:\n\nCanteloube: Bailero (Complete Songs of the Auvergne)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27gv9sNG7O0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27gv9sNG7O0)",

Since then, there have been numerous attempts to reconstruct it by various groups and pairings. \n\nDue to Garth Morton and Terence Rees’s unprecedented access to the D’Oyly Carte archive from which they gathered the relevant works, their recreation was seen by experts as the most authentic representation of the opera, and a successful run of performances went ahead in London in the 1960s; however the manuscripts for this version were sadly lost, due to damp and poor storage conditions.\n\nIt is therefore our intention to recreate this orchestration from live recordings taken from a 1969 performance (at the Glebe Theatre, London), plus some manuscripts from the British Library - as well as the existing notation files from the piano/vocal score (created by Pitch Perfect alongside Garth Morton himself) - in order to make a future run of performances a possibility (initially proposed by the Wolverton Gilbert and Sullivan Society, in 2026/2027), as well as to preserve it for generations to come, and save it from being lost once again. \n\nRewards:\n\nA £7+ donation gets you a copy of the Libretto (RRP £8.64)\n\nA £15+ donation gets you a Libretto, and a watermarked PDF of the piano/vocal score\n\nA £25+ donation gets you a physical copy of the piano/vocal score  (RRP £28.98)\n\nA £30+ donation gets you a physical copy of both the libretto AND the piano/vocal score (RRP £37.62)\n\nA £100+ donation gets you a watermarked PDF of the orchestral score, including parts (ETA late summer 2026)\n\nA £200+ donation gets you a physical copy of the orchestral score, including parts (ETA late summer 2026)\n\nThere are also several reward packages, aimed at groups and societies, which give the rights to put on performances of varying sizes and types (in line with standard licensing and hire fees). There is an option on the crowdfunding page to set up a fundraiser of your own, which would go towards it all - feel free to spread the word among your fellow G&amp;S fans!\n\n[https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/qr/OnvroQ5n?utm\\_campaign=sharemodal&amp;utm\\_medium=referral&amp;utm\\_source=shortlink](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/qr/OnvroQ5n?utm_campaign=sharemodal&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=shortlink)",

As a music educator and observer, I fully acknowledge that the jury’s artistic decisions must remain sovereign and beyond external interference.\n\n\n\nHowever, I wish to raise a systemic and procedural question for open and constructive discussion:\n\n\n\nShould the competition establish a clear and standardized rule regarding score adjustment or eligibility when a contestant is permitted to postpone their performance (for instance, due to illness or medical reasons)?\n\n\n\nAt present, it appears that only one contestant was granted a postponement in this year’s competition. While we all respect the jury’s decision and the contestant’s excellence, the absence of an explicit framework governing such exceptions may unintentionally raise concerns about fairness and consistency among the public and future participants.\n\n\n\nIn academic or professional examinations, postponement or make-up sessions (even for legitimate causes) often involve transparent policies — for instance, proportional score adjustments, clear medical verification, or alternative evaluation mechanisms — to balance fairness between all examinees. A comparable framework could help the Chopin Competition maintain both its artistic authority and procedural integrity.\n\n\n\nMy intention is not to challenge any individual result, but to advocate for a clear, codified policy that ensures equal treatment in future competitions. Such clarity will only strengthen the competition’s international credibility and trust.\n\n\n\nWith utmost respect and admiration,\n\nDr. Shui-Jui Kuo (郭書瑞)\n\nTaichung, Taiwan",

    "content": "Not just “romantic” or “passionate.” I mean sexual.\n\nSpecifically, either:\n\n1. **Sexual in Intent** – written out of obsession, lust, or scandal (Tristan und Isolde, Salome, Poème de l’extase, etc.), or\n2. **Unexpectedly Sexual** – weren’t meant that way, but feel erotic through your own interpretation of the libretto and/or the musical texture, pacing, or harmony that unexpectedly evoked a sense of desire or turned you on.\n\nI’m interested in both angles: how composers have written sensuality into music, and how listeners perceive eroticism in works that weren’t meant to be erotic at all. Here are some examples.\n\n**Sexual in context and intent:**\n\n* **Wagner –** ***Tristan und Isolde: Liebestod*** – deliberately erotic in both intent and musical design. Written during Wagner’s affair with Mathilde Wesendonck. The endless chromatic suspension, delayed cadences, and final harmonic release were meant to sonify orgasm.\n* **Strauss –** ***Salome: Dance of the Seven Veils*** – taboo seduction of her stepfather and the severed head. Strauss amplified the eroticism to near hysteria, deliberately mimicking the rhythm and buildup of the dance itself.\n* **Bizet –** ***Carmen (Seguidilla)*** – unlike the “Habanera,” this one is just pure seduction to force submission. Calculated eroticism, intimate powerplay — just honestly and absolutely insane.\n\n**Own subjective examples:**\n\n* **Schubert –** ***Du bist die Ruh*** – usually heard as devotional calm, but the suspended phrasing and inhaled silences make it sound like post-touch stillness. The line *“O füll’ es ganz”* (“Oh, fill it completely”) doesn’t help.\n* **Debussy –** ***Clair de lune*** – I know it sounds so serene, but the middle section’s legato and rubato create the sensation of continuous touch — stroking made sound (sorry). The eventual harmonic swell bursts like release, then exhales into stillness.\n* **Stravinsky –** ***The Rite of Spring: Sacrificial Dance*** – through sensation mostly. The rhythm takes over like a body seized by primitive drive and urgent need — pulse accelerating, control vanishing, everything pushing toward release through violence. Desire becomes destruction; climax becomes collapse.\n\nHow about you? What comes to mind and why?\n\nAsking because I've realised how overtly sexual pop or modern songs are, and I want to know how it was done in classical music (of any period). I’m also compiling it into a [Spotify playlist.](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1b8sKL9L8HgdcfRuxsJpwz?si=1e633a3d34f344fb)\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n***EDIT:*** *I’m genuinely puzzled how people flirt in DMs without even knowing my gender. Seriously, how? Take a shower. Lol.*",

    "content": "So I've been into classical music for a long time but have always felt I know a bit too little about it. I've listened to a lot of Chopin, a little Bach and obviously the famous classical works. I'm into math, science, cinema, video games etc but for all those you have some things that are wildly known to be the main pieces of work to study and understand the basics. But oh god when I try to search for anything about classical music there's no clear thread to follow. Please recommend something to act like a compass for me to study different themes of classical music and see what I like. Since I'm so clueless I won't say my favorite composers but here are some pieces I like so much:\n\nChopin - Ballade no.1 in G minor\n\nBach - Violin Concerto in A minor\n\nMozart - Sinfonia concertante for Violin and Viola in E-flat major (especially second movement)\n\nSarsate - Zigeunerweisen\n\nShubert - Schwanengesang\n\nTchaikovsky - Valse sentimentale\n\nP.S: please recommend a good version of the pieces thanks!",

    "title": "Analysis of Melot from Tristan und Isolde",
    "content": "This is a short textual analysis of the character I wrote when the ideas came to mind. It’s not polished with a tight structure and argument; just a first draft of the ideas. \n\nIn Richard Wagner’s opera Tristan und Isolde, the two titular characters are having an illicit tryst when the character Melot  interrupts them suddenly. Tristan, his friend, he betrays by showing King Marke, Isolde’s husband, the affair. This act is self-serving: Melot wants King Marke’s approval, but he doesn’t get it. Instead, King Marke is overcome with grief that Tristan felt he could never tell him of his feelings for Isolde.\n\nAs a character, Melot has only 15 lines in the whole four-hour opera. His sole dramatic purpose is to be a foil to Tristan. He has three actions. One, to intrude on the tryst and show King Marke Tristan’s betrayal (9 lines). Two, to challenge Tristan to a sword fight after (3 lines). Three, to follow Isolde to Brittany at the same time as King Marke (3 lines).\n\nIf Tristan is the metaphysical lover, Melot’s intrusion in Act Two makes him the metaphysical love-denier. I stated that his intent was to gain King Marke’s approval (indeed, Brangäne states earlier in Act 2 “Von Tristan zu Marke ist Melots weg”), but there are other interpretations… though none as explicitly rendered by the text as this. Perhaps Melot is jealous of Tristan, or even of Isolde.\n\nAt the end of Act 2, after King Marke’s monologue of grief, Melot is suddenly angered again when Tristan shows gentle affection to Isolde. He draws his sword to goad Tristan into a fight. Tristan, obliging, says “Dein Blick, Isolde, blendet auch’ ihn” but drops his sword to allow Melot’s to penetrate him. On the one hand, this act more readily implies Melot’s own desire for Isolde and the resulting jealousy, but on the other hand it is so phallic that I can’t help but read Melot as being queer-coded. If it was true, we wouldn’t expect Tristan to openly admit such a possibility.\n\nMelot’s final act in the opera is to briefly return in Act 3. In the meantime, Tristan has retreated to his birthplace in Brittany, France to tend to the wounds inflicted by Melot. Isolde has followed Tristan; Brangäne has explained all so that King Marke forgives Tristan completely, and the company is following Isolde in turn to reunite the lovers. However, it is too late. Tristan is dead. Isolde dies of grief.\n\nIt is ambiguous if Melot has repented and is travelling with King Marke to reconcile the lovers, or is still jealous and bitter and is travelling separately with his own agenda. Wagner gives us equally-balanced evidence, either way. The violent way in which Melot accosts Kurwenal gives rise to the latter taking his life, but as he lays dying he says “Weh mir, Tristan!”. Could this be regret, self-pity or even romantic repression expressing itself slightly? It’s impossible to tell for certain. Personally, I read Melot here in a more forgiving light.\n\nOverall, it’s startling to me how much complexity Wagner can render to the story, and a minor character, in so few lines. I admit that the evidence for Melot being gay in Wagner’s opera is iffy, but my interpretation is chiefly based on my own feelings about it as a queer person which also has validity.",

Mwuahahaha! \n\nSo I'm writing a DnD one shot, and when I run these, I enjoy putting a soundtrack to them. I find it keeps my ADD ass players in line. Anyway, I've found two songs that really invoke two feelings I'd like to be able to instill in my players throughout the session. I'm hoping you all can help me fill out my Spotify playlist.\n\nAt about 2:10 into Petricor by Ludovico Einaudi, the way the music swells there is rather anxiety inducing. As this is a level 15 all combat one shot, I'm going to rely on the music to help the players feel like they're not just wiping the floor with what I'm throwing at them. If there are any other songs that evoke that same dread and anxiety, I'd love to hear about them!\n\nThen secondly, all of One The Nature Of Daylight by Max Richter really gives me very desperate hopefullness. Something like:\n\nYour cleric is down, your Barbarian is too. You see the Illithilich, one hand holding the massive hole in it's side from your dead Fighter's enchanted warpick,  preparing to finish their ritual. The second coming of the evil tyrant, the King of Giants, seems inevitable. Your wizard steps next to you, and kneels. A sad, knowing look on her face. \"Shut your eyes. They're brighter up close.\" You've heard the next part a hundred times. It really was always her favorite spell. Such a stereotype. Your body is engulfed in flame at the same time as you hear the shrieks of the tentacled monstrosity 20 feet ahead of you. The spire, the source of his power, the Illithilich, you, your friends, and the remains of the King of Giants, are all reduced to ash as the last syllable of the Wizard's fireball spell leaves her lips. \n\nThat song feels like that. Anything that portrays that would also be off great interest to me. Other than those two, any dark semi fast paced combat music would be wonderful! Thanks in advance!",

However, I can’t seem to find them on IMSLP or any other websites unless they’re making me pay for it. To be fair, Puccini solo piano works are a lesser known part of his catalog so it makes sense for them not to be just out on the internet, but they are so beautiful! I want to learn them. If anyone knows how to get their hands on the manuscripts, I’d love to see them.",

    "content": "October 19th marks the birthday of the brilliant Norwegian composer, whose story is one of unimaginable tragedy and remarkable rebirth.\n\nIn 1970, a devastating fire in his home studio destroyed an estimated 80% of his manuscripts. Entire operas, piano concertos, and dozens of piano sonatas—most of his life's work—vanished in the flames. For a composer, this was the worst possible nightmare, and it crushed Tveitt's creativity until his death in 1981.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. In the years since his death, remarkable efforts have been made to reconstruct his lost works from surviving copies, recordings, and orchestral parts scattered across Europe.\n\nSeveral of his piano concertos have been brought back to life this way. Here are three of them:\n\nPiano Concerto No. 1, Op. 1  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL\\_\\_VMJjPI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL__VMJjPI0)\n\nPiano Concerto No. 4, \"Aurora Borealis,\" Op. 130:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7MTZP0jAxo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7MTZP0jAxo)\n\nPiano Concerto No. 5, Op. 156:  \n[https://youtu.be/UaJ7DgPEwdo?si=n0edac\\_HE3TCg9sN](https://youtu.be/UaJ7DgPEwdo?si=n0edac_HE3TCg9sN)\n\nThanks to these incredible efforts, we can now explore the powerful and evocative sound world of a composer who was almost lost to history.",

They typically have an absurd number of age/discipline categories, presumably to make there be more \"First Prizes\" and \"Grand Prizes\" to give out.  If there is prize money to give out, it's usually predicated on a submission receiving a 99/100 or perfect score, which of course they have no obligation to give out...\n\nI suppose it's possible that \"winning\" one of these contests could help a musician fill our their CV, but people in the industry do know that these are total BS, right?

Bach.\n\nAlong with Schein and Scheidt, he is often considered one of the \"Three Ss\" of early German Baroque music. One of the most interesting details about him, however, is his nickname.\n\nIn German, his surname, \"Schütz,\" is related to the word for \"shooter\" or \"archer\" (Schütze). Because of this, he adopted the Latin name of the archer constellation: Sagittarius. Some of his published scores bear the Latinized name \"Henricus Sagittarius,\" and he is said to have deliberately modified his signature to allude to it.\n\nWhile much of his secular stage music has been lost, his sacred compositions, such as the magnificent Psalmen Davids (Psalms of David), demonstrate why he is regarded as the \"Father of German Music.\"\n\nLet's listen to his monumental work on the anniversary of his birth.\n\nHeinrich Schütz – Psalmen Davids  \n[https://youtu.be/WVd9KU\\_wDoo](https://youtu.be/WVd9KU_wDoo)",

    "content": "I really like the orchestration and playful mood of a lot of Poulenc's music, especially his chamber music, but it's a bit too chromatic for me sometimes. Any works that are similar in feel but more diatonic and easier to get into? I really like Ravel but he doesn't always hold my attention. I also love Kodaly if that helps, specifically his Dances of Galanta, as well as the concerti of Korngold, Rachmaninoff, and Saint-Saens (though similarly I find Saint-Saens a bit boring sometimes).  \nI'm basically just looking for music that isn't too long and boring and has memorable themes that I can hear and notice, as well as interesting orchestration.",

    "title": "Thoughts On Composers Franz Gordon, Hakdo, Peter Gundry, and other similar composers?",
    "content": "Other than Joshua Kyan Aalampour, which I'm not even going to TRY to get into or I'm gonna offend one of the sides of THAT argument, what are your thoughts on these composers?\n\nI like all of them! Highly debatable, but yeah I would count them as Modern Classical. I like all of their songs and the different nature of their songs compared to classical composers like Bach, Schubert, and Mendelssohn because of how different it is and I love how they still use some kind of classical instrument to give their music that classical feel.\n\nI have to say, even if you don't think they're classical, it doesn't mean they don't sound good. At least try listening to it before you say it's bad. Also on Google it says that Hakdo, Peter Gundry, and Franz Gordon are some form of classical, whether that be classical, neoclassical, or some other type of classical. Take that as you will.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, you can definely tell when your listening to Classical or Modern Classical, but I think that's okay. It doesn't mean that Modern Classical is bad, it just has a new identity.\n\nMy favorites among the composers pieces have to be:\n\nWhen The Devil Falls In Love - Hakdo                                       \nThe Vampire Masquerade - Peter Gundry                                                     \nNocturnal Daydream - Franz Gordon                                                     \nNightfall - Hyung Mook Kim                                                                              \nLa Papillon Solitaire - Franz Gordon                                                                                                        \nWaltz For The Drowded Ophelia - Hakdo                                                                                                        \nHaruka's Love Letter - Hakdo                                                                                                  \n\nThese are great pieces to just listen to. Like I stated earlier, listen to a Modern Classical piece like an example I listed here and go on from there.\n\nAll in all, I like this genre. I do wish there were more purely classical composers, like another Mozart or Beethoven but in modern times, but that doesn't mean I don't like the way Modern Classical is going. I think of it as music that has classical elements and classical instruments combined with music from present day.",

    "content": "Hello again!\nThank you so much for the warm response to Part 1 of this series.\n\nIn this post, I’d like to look at the major scale not as a formula to memorize, but as a structure of balance and color.\n\nWe usually describe it as: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half.\n\nBut there’s a deeper musical idea here:\n\nThe major scale is built from two identical four-note units (tetrachords) placed in sequence, separated by a whole tone.\n\nThis isn’t strict “symmetry” in the geometric sense; rather, it’s a repeated pattern that creates a clear sense of balance and continuity.\n\n🎼 Example: C major\nC–D–E–F (first tetrachord)\nG–A–B–C (second tetrachord)\nBoth share the same W–W–H pattern, connected by a whole tone between F and G.\n\nSeen this way, scales stop being abstract rules and start to feel like musical landscapes—spaces where sound unfolds with balance, contrast, and direction.\n\n👉 Coming up in Part 3\nNext time, we’ll look at the subdominant (IV) and dominant (V)—not just “below” and “above,” but as essential supports of the tonic. Their role in cadences reveals why they are truly the pillars of tonal music.",

    "content": "\"There is something peculiar about the Missa Solemnis\" is one of the most oft quoted critiques of this majestic work. Probably because as an observation, it doesn't quite tip over into negativity - but still manages to call out the unease the work has evoked since it's premiere.\n\nMy own answer to the questions the work raises - is that the answer has been hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe theorists of this world can do a better job than me at defining what a symphonist is. But there's no arguing that Beethoven was a symphonist to his very core. \n\nThat's where the 'Missa Solemnis' comes from. A place of an all embracing and expansive grip on how to say what you have to to say.\n\nThanks God he had so much to say.",

    "content": "On October 17, 1771, the opera Ascanio in Alba (KV 111), composed by a 15-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, premiered in Milan.\n\nThis work wasn't just any opera; it was commissioned by the powerful Empress Maria Theresia for the wedding of her son, Archduke Ferdinand. Given its celebratory purpose, it was given the rare title of \"theatrical serenata.\"\n\nWhat makes this premiere fascinating is the story surrounding it. The main event was supposed to be an opera “Ruggiero” by Johann Adolph Hasse, a giant of the music world at the time. Mozart's work might have been treated as a prelude—though this is speculative.\n\nHowever, Mozart's proud father, Leopold, wrote home claiming that his son's serenata was a massive success, completely overshadowing Hasse's opera. He boasted, \"I am sorry to say that Wolfgang's serenata has, so to speak, put Hasse's opera out of countenance.\"\n\nKnowing Leopold's tendency to brag, we have to take this with a grain of salt. But the fact that Hasse's opera turned out to be his last gives the story a legendary feel. It paints a vivid picture of a young genius already making waves and challenging the old guard.\n\nLet's enjoy the outpouring of genius from the young master on the anniversary of its premiere!\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart - Ascanio in Alba KV 111  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjEQ1uRtvU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyjEQ1uRtvU)",

Before that, most of Bach's works weren't widely performed or appreciated outside of Leipzig; he went from being considered a small-timer in the composing world (if considered at all) to being known as the genius we think of today. And yes, I know that's a simplistic retelling.\n\nIf you could do that for a composer today, who would it be? Who do you think has been forgotten, overlooked, or underplayed? It doesn’t have to be someone totally obscure (although that would be nice), just someone you think deserves a second chance in the spotlight. Also, any specific pieces that you think people should listen to?\n\nEdit:  These are amazing suggestions, thank you!",

    "title": "Seeking deeper insight into Schumann’s Humoreske, Op. 20 — beyond the Jean Paul connection",
    "content": "Hello fellow classical music enthusiasts,\n\nI’ve been revisiting Robert Schumann’s *Humoreske in B-flat major*, Op. 20, and I’m struck by how elusive and layered this piece feels,  emotionally, structurally, and philosophically. The title itself, *Humoreske*, seems deceptively lighthearted, yet the music is anything but simple comedy or whimsy.\n\nI understand from standard sources that Schumann was inspired by the literary style of Jean Paul, whose “humor” was more about emotional depth and irony than jokes. But I’m curious to hear from others who’ve studied or performed this work:\n\n 1. Why did Schumann choose the title “Humoreske**”**? Is it meant to reflect Jean Paul’s idea of humor as a blend of melancholy and joy? Or is it more of a musical experiment in emotional fragmentation?                                                                                                                 2**.** What deeper structural or thematic layers do you hear in the piece? Beyond the seven loosely connected sections, are there recurring motifs or emotional arcs that suggest a hidden narrative?                                                                                                                           3. Are there any lesser-known analyses or recordings that help you understand this piece more deeply?\n\n  \nWhether you’re a pianist, theorist, or just a passionate listener, your thoughts are welcome.\n\nThanks in advance for helping me explore this beautiful and enigmatic work more deeply.",

    "content": "A little while ago, I got tickets to see Ray Chen and Julio Elizalde at Jorgensen Theater, and I was so excited to see Ray Chen in person and hear him play on his \"dolphin\" Stradivarius. Today was the concert, and his performance was wonderful. He did Beethoven's Violin Sonata No.8 in G Major, Op.30, and Saint-Saëns Violin Sonata No.1 in D minor, Op 75 during the first half. \n\nThen it was intermission, and he performed Chaconne, and during the performance, I noticed this middle-aged woman in the row in front of me (the 7th row) was recording the concert maybe 2 or 3 times, for maybe a max of 5 seconds each time on her phone. Then after the Chaconne, there's this old lady with a hunchback in my row that gets up.  I had seen this old lady before, after the Saint-Saëns she stood up immediately and caused a standing ovation so I could tell that this woman was a true enjoyer of classical music and I admired that but then what happened next actually made me so mad. She berates the woman for recording loudly, saying \"you shouldn't be recording the concert, it should be illegal\" in a angry tone and then the two of them did a little staring contest with the old lady with a pissed off face and the middle age lady in shock and silence. \n\nI didn't quite catch the whole thing, so I might've missed some of it. But it was a rapid interaction, and I could tell everyone around the old lady and the woman was uncomfortable, looking around, shifting awkwardly, and wondering if that actually happened. Now I know that it's not allowed to record the performance at classical concerts and there was an announcement at the start to not record. But I actually got so mad, because the woman who was recording didn't distract me from the amazing performance, but it was the old lady who decided to humiliate her that took my focus from the rest of the concert. \n\nI couldn't stop thinking about how could this happen in 2025, every year the pool of people who enjoy classical music gets smaller and this is part of the reason that people feel like they can't listen to or attend classical contests because of people like this old lady making others feel unwelcome and ashamed. Everyone is dying, and the fact that this woman decided to use this last portion of her life as a chance to make other people feel unwelcome and embarrassed actually made me so mad. Especially in a space that is seen already seen as \"elitist\". Honestly, in my opinion, that old lady should've just spoken to that woman in private or talked to her politely in between the pieces to put her phone away rather than shaming her in public. This actually ruined the rest of the concert for me, and I couldn't focus on the other 3 pieces and the encore performances. \n\nAnyway, can someone let me know if I'm overreacting or if that old woman was justified in being that angry? Thanks for reading this little rant and also this is a throwaway account as I'm not sure how people will react to this. \n\nAlso, a side note that Jorgensen's website says that Ray Chen is playing on the dolphin Strad, but I saw an article that says that the instrument was loaned to someone else. So what did he hear him play on?",

    "content": "I am thrilled to announce the recent publication of *Bach: The Cello Suites* on the Cambridge Music Handbooks Series. Information about the book and a short trailer are available at [https://www.Bach-Cello-Suites.com](https://www.Bach-Cello-Suites.com).\n\nYou can order it wherever books are sold, and it will soon be available in digital formats as well. The attached flyer includes a code valid for a 20% discount (paperback available for $16 USD or £12). Please share with any musicians or music lovers who may be interested!\n\n====\n\nHere's a short synopsis of the book:\n\nOriginally dismissed as curiosities, J. S. Bach's Cello Suites are now understood as the pinnacle of composition for unaccompanied cello. This handbook examines how and why Bach composed these highly innovative works. It explains the characteristics of each of the dance types used in the suites and reveals the compositional methods that achieve cohesion within each suite. Edward Klorman discusses the four manuscript copies of Bach's lost original and the valuable evidence they contain on how the Suites might be performed. He explores how, after around 1860, the Cello Suites gradually entered the concert hall, where they initially received a mixed critical and audience reception. The Catalan cellist Pablo Casals extensively popularized them through his concerts and recordings, setting the paradigm for several generations to follow. The Cello Suites now have a global resonance, influencing music from Benjamin Britten's Cello Suites to J-pop, and media from K-drama to Ingmar Bergman's films.\n\nFor further details, you're welcome to visit the companion website:\n\nTRAILER VIDEO ([http://www.Bach-Cello-Suites.com](http://www.Bach-Cello-Suites.com))\n\nLOOK INSIDE: SAMPLE CHAPTER, TABLE OF CONTENTS, INDEX ([https://www.bach-cello-suites.com/about-3](https://www.bach-cello-suites.com/about-3))\n\nENDORSEMENTS: ([https://www.bach-cello-suites.com/about-the-book](https://www.bach-cello-suites.com/about-the-book))\n\nTEASERS: On social media, I've also been sharing weekly posts with \"teasers\" about different threads from the book. You can view those on Facebook ([https://www.facebook.com/BachTheCelloSuites](https://www.facebook.com/BachTheCelloSuites)), Instagram ([https://www.instagram.com/bach\\_the\\_cello\\_suites](https://www.instagram.com/bach_the_cello_suites)), or Bluesky ([https://bsky.app/profile/eklorman.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/eklorman.bsky.social)).\n\nThe book is written for musicians, music teachers, and music lovers alike. Even for musicians who have lived with the Cello Suites over a long time, I believe you will encounter new (often surprising) information, including about cellos and cello technique from Bach's lifetime, about the manuscript sources, about how the suites may have been composed, about the tremendous variety of approaches adopted in earliest performances starting around 1860, and about the ubiquity of the Cello Suites today both in concert life and in pop culture.",

    "content": "Airat Ichmouratov    \nConcerto Grosso N1 Op.28  \nOrford Art's Centre, Canada 15 July 2011  \nOrford Camerata , Jean Francois Rivest Conductor  \n  \nAlexandre da Costa Violin  \nElvira Misbakhova Viola  \nStephane Tetreault Cello  \nAirat Ichmouratov Clarinet  \nWonny Song Piano  \n  \n Music for Chamber Orchestra, Modern Classical Music  \n  \nTowards the end of the middle movement of Ichmouratov’s Concerto Grosso No. 1, Op. 28 (2011), there’s a melismatic clarinet doina. That’s a rhapsodic, improvised meditation, now a part of the klezmer style, but having its origins in Romanian folk music. This doina, especially its opening phrase, is the musical cell out of which Ichmouratov develops his concerto. It generates several themes and initially led to the composer’s choice of five solo instruments: violin, clarinet, viola, cello and piano. In the baroque concerto grosso, these would form the solo group (the concertino), passing musical material back and forth with members of the larger orchestra (the ripieno). This division of solo and ensemble instrumentation, however, is Ichmouratov’s main nod in the direction of the traditional concerto grosso. (He explores the possibilities further in his Concerto Grosso No. 2, Op. 60 (2018) for violin, flute, harp and orchestra, which is written in a contemporary baroque style). A shimmering fanfare from piano and strings announces an exuberant, upbeat, somewhat neoclassical opening theme, first from the violins, then clarinet. Its Prokofiev-like irreverence and good humour contrasts with a broad, lyrical second theme. This soon begins to taper towards something mysterious, only to be brushed aside by the traditional repeat of the opening ideas, as in the exposition of a classical symphony. But appearances can be misleading as Ichmouratov soon goes on to develop the lyrical second theme into a short Tchaikovsky-like ballet scene. As the two themes are further developed the music broadens into the composer’s homage to Rachmaninoff and his love of bells. The clarinet introduces a traditional Russian folk song (‘Mother dear, it's dusty in the field’) and then there’s an unwinding towards four decisive chords and a final salute to the rising opening figure of the main theme.  \n  \nThe three movements are played without break. In the central Adagio, the solo cello transforms the rising motif into a lament, Jewish in its modality, but original to the composer. It is heard three times before the clarinet dramatizes it in a full-throated lament, marked doloroso (sad). A calming, consoling passage follows before the lamenting theme is revisited, now on viola, accompanied by sobbing strings. This theme is heard four times, with mounting intensity until the clarinet makes the lamenting intensely personal in its doina, and the movement eventually unwinds to a murmur. The main theme of the finale, a direct descendent of the broad, lyrical second theme in the opening movement, is announced with a virtuoso flourish by the solo violin. This is then echoed by viola and, before long, by a full orchestra and now extended into a joyous paean. Over a marching bass, angular triplet figures accompany a new freylekh-style violin melody, partly forged out of the triplets. It builds to a frenetic climax, dominated by wailing clarinet, soon to develop further with a return of the joyous main theme, now from both violin and piano. The momentum carries forward like a spinning dreidel into a return of the shimmering opening fanfare, more snatched glimpses of past themes, and a teasing parting shot from the clarinet. Ichmouratov’s Concerto Grosso No. 1 was commissioned by Jean-François Rivest, Alexandre Da Costa and the Orford Arts Centre and first performed by them July 15, 2011. It is dedicated to Yuli Turovsky (1939-2013), conductor, cellist and founder of I Musici de Montréal, a musician whom Airat Ichmouratov credits with providing a turning point in his life and career.  ©Keith Horner",

Debussy requested that Katsushika Hokusai's \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\" be featured on the cover of the first edition of the score. We even have photographic evidence of the print hanging in his study.\n\nThis has led to the popular theory that the music was inspired by the ukiyo-e print. However, there is no definitive historical proof, leaving it as a captivating mystery. It's a powerful example of the connection between Eastern and Western art, even if the direct creative link remains speculative.\n\nAs you listen to \"La Mer,\" do you feel the spirit of Hokusai's wave, or do you consider it more of a beautiful myth? I'm curious to hear what this community thinks.",

    "title": "My favorite \"counterhistorical anecdote\": did Vienna get sick of Haydn and Mozart and have a neo-Baroque movement around 1800? Surely not, but that's what Antoine Reicha says!",
    "content": "&gt; Everyone knows that real and fine instrumental music was created by Haydn and Mozart. It had been played so much that by the beginning of 1800 the Viennese public was already sick and tired of it. A new music, more or less baroque in style, was replacing it. \n\nThis is from Reicha's autobiographical notes, which you can find an English translation of in the appendix of Millard M. Laing's dissertation on Reicha's wind quintets, \"Anton Reicha's Quintets for Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Horn, and Bassoon\".\n\nIn his wonderful book \"The Symphony in Beethoven's Vienna\", David Wyn Jones dismisses Reicha's observation as obviously untrue; I'm not sure whether any other scholar has commented on it. I'm certainly not aware of any pieces that fit Reicha's description, but who knows . . .\n\nThere is another brilliant book: Mary Sue Morrow's Concert Life in Haydn’s Vienna, that has a list of public concerts; but you see a lot of Haydn and Mozart there as well.",

    "content": "**tl;dr:** I admire classical music but feel emotionally disconnected from it, while I see it moves others to tears or joy. Is it possible to \"learn\" or \"train\" yourself to feel that emotional depth, and if so, how can I start?\n\n---\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm hoping to get some advice from this passionate community as I try to transition from a casual listener to someone who can seriously engage with classical music.\n\nMy main motivation is the profound emotional connection that so many of you seem to have with this art form. I often find myself on YouTube, listening to a famous piece, and I'll scroll through the comments. I'm always struck by how many people describe being moved to tears, filled with indescribable joy, or feeling a deep, soul-stirring catharsis. I truly want to understand and experience that myself.\n\nI feel like I'm missing something fundamental. For me, 99% of the classical music I listen to fails to evoke any significant emotional response. I can recognize that it's beautiful, complex, and masterfully composed, but it almost always remains just that, a pleasant background for other activities like working or reading. \n\nThis has led me to a crucial question: Is an emotional connection to classical music something you can cultivate, or is it an innate trait? Can you actually train your ear and your heart to connect with it on a deeper level? Is there a recommended path for a beginner to go from simply \"hearing\" the music to truly feeling it?\n\nI would be incredibly grateful for any advice or insights you could share.\n\nThank you!",

Even finding students, to say nothing of good students, was very competitive and difficult. \n\nItalian opera was in demand but you were also quite limited by it as well. Even Da Ponte, Mozart's librettist, moved to New York due to difficult circumstances.\n\nI would look at Mozart as some sort of irresponsible guy because he had all these pets and kids that died. But then again , one also sees how much he struggled to get commissions and work in general. \n\nI know his son was also a composer, Bu I don't know too much of how his life went",

Last month, WPSU, a public radio station based at Penn State, became the first casualty of the cuts, announcing that it would “wind down” after decades of service.\nIn addition to local, regional and world news and other educational and cultural programming, those two dozen mostly rural Pennsylvania counties served by WPSU also lost hours of classical music — a sizable portion of the station’s daily programming.\nFor classical music lovers, this minor-sounding closure should strike an ominous chord: When you consider that some 96 percent of the classical music on U.S. radio is broadcast over public airwaves, a single loss feels like the tip of a particularly perilous iceberg. The potential closure of public radio stations threatens the availability of free, over-the-air classical music for millions of people.”",

    "content": "Today, I came across the tragic and fascinating story of the Austrian composer Alexander von Zemlinsky, who was born on this day in 1871. His life was a painful lesson in how love and cruelty can shape art.\n\nHe was a brilliant composer, and his early talent was championed by none other than Johannes Brahms. Brahms greatly admired his Clarinet Trio, and when you listen to it, the influence is undeniable — it's a charming piece that feels like a spiritual successor to Brahms's own clarinet chamber music.\n\nClarinet Trio, Op. 3 (1896)  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCb2lgK9LWI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCb2lgK9LWI)\n\nHowever, Zemlinsky's life took a tragic turn. He was plagued by insecurities about his appearance, which were cruelly exploited during his love affair with his student Alma Schindler. She ultimately left him for the more famous Gustav Mahler.\n\nThis devastating heartbreak became the driving force behind his art. He composed the opera Der Zwerg (The Dwarf), based on an Oscar Wilde story about a dwarf who falls in love with a beautiful princess, only to be rejected and treated like an amusing toy. It is a direct and gut-wrenching musical expression of his own pain.\n\nForced to flee the Nazis, he died in obscurity in New York. Thankfully, his powerful and deeply personal music is being rediscovered today, enabling his true artistic stature to finally emerge.",

    "title": "Favourite Tschaikovsky recordings/similar composers",
    "content": "Hello all!\n\nSo, I've always absolutely adored The Nutcracker; I used to have lots of trouble sleeping as a baby/toddler, and the only things that would stop me from crying were Tschaikovsky (the nutcracker specifically) and Metallica. When I got a bit older, she'd also take me to ballet productions (we try go go every winter although we haven't in a few years; we are this year though!), which is all to say, I absolutely LOVE it.\n\nRecently, I wanted to expand a bit since I've never really \"listened\" to classical music, outside of putting on a few common works mainly as background music. But, I fell absolutely in love with Bach, as well as Tschaikovsky's Swan Lake.\n\nHowever, I've only really ever listened to the Berliner Philharmoniker recording of The Nutcracker, and the London Symphony Orchestra recording with Andre Previn of Swan Lake. Please note, I love these recordings a lot, and have absolutely NO problems with them! But, I would love to know some alternate recordings, so I can listen for any differences and just get some more experience with the music, so what are your favourite recordings of the two ballets? (Bonus points if you can point me to some good recordings of the actual ballets! The only ballet I've ever seen is live performances of the nutcracker, but I'd love to get into that realm a bit more).\n\nAs an extra question; what composers produce similar music to these works by Tschaikovsky? I can't describe what I love about them very well, but I will try: both ballets feel very \"grand\", and for me at least, they connect emotionally a lot better than 90% of classical I listen to. Even Bach, whom I adore, I struggle to connect with emotionally; I mostly love him for his musical technicality (I am an engineering major and I have a long history of loving math, so attaching those pattern-seeking tendencies to Bach is an absolute goldmine and a joy to listen to and parse through. Fugues, my beloved). Something about Tschaikovsky, the grandness of the orchestra while still being absolutely heartbreakingly beautiful and really just effortlessly painting a scene to fall into, REALLY connects with me. I do appreciate and ocassionally enjoy other works like Planets by Holst, but they just don't quite hit the same. Shostokovitch too, while I LOVE his quartets, they feel a lot more self-contained; Tschaikovsky's ballets feel like hours of a coherent thought (which, I guess they are) whereas many other long compositions (Planets, The Four Seasons) feel like different ideas put together. Not a bad thing, I just have to be in a very specific mood for them!\n\nSo, what other composers would you recommend I check out similar to Tschaikovsky? I apologize for the long post, I just wanted to try and paint more specifically what I'm looking for. I appreciate you all!!",

Is it simply because he lives in the shadows of the \"greatest\" and of the ones that were remembered? As well as not being recognised (yet?) a lot today? \n\nLet me know what you think / know!

I’ve studied other pieces like Sensemaya for this, but I’ve otherwise been disappointed with most Phrygian based modes being a bit too cliche (Belkis Regina di Saba for example). \n\nI’m looking for similar motifs to how the brass are used right before the first repeat, which is why I looked at Sensemaya as well. And then the ironic march that’s explosive yet somewhat tribal. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on further pieces that I could check out to further my understanding of this specific style and orchestration (the Caucus style) \n\nThanks so much!",

I thought I had a long formal dress for the occasion, but it turns out it doesn't fit me (I've been dealing with chronic illness and I bought it several years ago - go figure). Yes, I know I should've been more on top of this months ago. Things have just been crazy.  Actually, several months ago, I wasn't sure I'd be able to perform at all... Plus it is short sleeved, and I'm concerned that I will be cold since it will be in November (another thing I wasn't considering until recently).\n\n  \nI tried ordering a dress online, but it didn't fit. Have looked at multiple stores in person and online and the only thing I can find in my size with \"long sleeves\" is a burgundy ruffle mesh top, which I would pair with a matching camisole, and matching floor length skirt. It has the problem of potentially being too cold since the sleeves are mesh, but at least its my size, and I don't have to worry about the top being too low cut, especially with the camisole underneath.\n\nI've linked the top and skirt to this post. I tried them both on together, and I think it looks really nice on me. The questions I have are whether it is a) too dramatic for a college recital and b) somehow immodest/ tacky/ would not be appropriate for some other reason?\n\nRuffle top: [https://francescas.com/product/12CL21XY3D/isabella-sheer-ruffle-blouse](https://francescas.com/product/12CL21XY3D/isabella-sheer-ruffle-blouse)\n\nSkirt: [https://francescas.com/product/14CE67LZL5/melody-asymmetrical-satin-midi-skirt](https://francescas.com/product/14CE67LZL5/melody-asymmetrical-satin-midi-skirt)",

    "content": "Perhaps my sample size is too small, but whenever I read about Beethoven's work, or the general topic of eras in music, it's about how Beethoven is grouped as 'classical' with the likes of Mozart and Hayden, and not 'romantic' with the likes of Schubert, Weber, and Schumann. Honestly, I don't see it. Mozart's last symphony sounds less like Beethoven's first (at least stylistically) than Schubert's last symphony does, to me, anyways. The 'Eroica' came out ten years after the 'London' symphony, with the latter being a perfectly-proportioned example of Rococo art and the former supposedly being epoch-defining. Everything from structure, orchestration, development, and scope is bigger with Beethoven, and western music never really looked back. Is it a time thing? Because Der Freischütz had already debuted before Beethoven's 9th and Pagannini was already in his 40s. Schubert's *Unfinished* was finished. \n\nSorry about getting ranty, probably just overthinking this.",

It was performed on the 27th of September 2025 by the Octava Chamber Orchestra, conducted by David Waltman and is my interpretation of the mystical aspects of ravens in northern european folklore.\n\nIn it - in particular the first movement - I wanted to try out some aleatoric techniques, which I hadn't done before. Since the other pieces performed that night were Beethoven's 1st piano concerto and 2nd symphony, this is written for a smaller orchestra and also serves as a testbed for a larger orchestral work I am composing.\n\nAny criticism and or feedback is much appreciated. Hope you enjoy it!",

    "content": "André Navarra, the powerhouse French cellist born on this day in 1911, was a fascinating figure. Alongside giants like Fournier and Tortelier, he represented the pinnacle of the French cello school.\n\nOf particular interest is his dual role as both a guardian of tradition and a champion of the new. His deep musicality is clearly evident in his interpretations of the classics, as demonstrated by his beautiful performance of Schubert's Arpeggione Sonata.  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=senpDhsVoM4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=senpDhsVoM4)\n\nHowever, he also used his immense talent to bring new works to life, premiering concertos written especially for him. For example, he gave the first performance of André Jolivet's Cello Concerto No. 1 in 1962. This powerful, modern piece showcases a completely different side to his artistry.\n\nJolivet – Cello Concerto No. 1  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDh7YfcJyBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDh7YfcJyBI)\n\nSeeing a master of his stature so committed to the music of his own time is inspiring.",

At first, I thought it was a difference of creativity and storytelling: program music was written to describe a fictional narrative or landscape, and absolute music was written for the pure sake of musical writing. But if this is the case, then why do some pieces by the conservative composers refer to stories as well? For example, Brahms' \"Schicksalslied\" is a choral setting to a poem by Friedrich Hölderlin. Was the war more about the technical, stylistic differences between romantic vs classical music? How much did the aim of storytelling distinguish program music from absolute?",

If you listen to   \nOrff's \"Carmina Burana\" -- the section \"In Trutina\" \\[NB I'm referring to the very short section \"In Trutina\", not the famous \"O Fortuna\"\\]\n\n\\-- it bears a remarkable resemblance to  \"Bailero\" from Canteloube's Chants d'Auvergne.\n\nCanteloube's piece was written a decade earlier, but I'm unclear as to when it was first performed. \n\nI wonder if the two pieces strike others as being as similar as they sound to my ear. Its not plagiarism or anything like that, just a remarkably similar aesthetic. I haven't heard it discussed before (albeit, I'm not a student of this period of music). Is it possible Orff heard this piece? Or is there some common source for both of them?\n\nHere's the Canteloube  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkPKXU7G82k&amp;list=RDPkPKXU7G82k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkPKXU7G82k&amp;list=RDPkPKXU7G82k)\n\nand the Orff  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vffPDgUT-Bo&amp;list=RDvffPDgUT-Bo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vffPDgUT-Bo&amp;list=RDvffPDgUT-Bo)\n\n . . . and I'm curious about whether there are any threads that connected these two works. Obviously there's the attraction to pastoral themes, and both Orff and Canteloube were working from historical/folkloric sources. And while neither were directly linked to Debussy, his influence can be felt on both, I suppose.",

    "content": "in response to [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1o56rkv/who\\_is\\_your\\_guy\\_and\\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1o56rkv/who_is_your_guy_and_why/) \n\nThe list is quite lengthy \\[I'm a huge fans of Beethoven's\\], so a separate post.\n\n**GOAT:**\n\n\\* Weingartner — well, simply the only member of the \"post-Wagnerian five\" to leave the full set recorded. He played the full cycle first time in 1902! A unique insight to the late classical era, and a very stylish (surprisingly rather Mendelssohnian than Wagnerian) approach.\n\n\\* Fritz Reiner / CSO (No. 2 with Pittsburgh) — extremely fierce, but at the same time poignant (which fits the Beethoven style most IMO). The best No. 3, No. 5 and No. 9\n\n**Top Tier:**\n\n\\* Karajan-1963 (the first set with the Berlin Philharmonic, recorded in 1961-62) — the best of Karajan's, when he already secured a top orchestra, but hadn't evolved towards dull perfection. Also, the acoustics of the Jesus-Christe Kirche gives it a unique flavor\n\n\\* Mengelberg LIVE — I'm not a fan of hyper-romantic approaches in general and Mengelberg in particular, but his live recordings are one of a kind. The Napoleon of the orchestra, the roar and thunder to be expressed in music. Studio recordings are ok, but not convincing (me).\n\n\\* Schuricht (the full cycle is with the Paris Conservatoire, which is rather weak; take recordings with Stuttgart RSO / Vienna Philharmonic wherever possible) — very much German Old School, a perfect balance of Apollonian vs. Dionysian\n\n\\* Cluytens / BPO — a very dark, thoughtful Beethoven, for long winter evenings\n\n\\* Eugen Jochum / BPO — the first cycle (of three) is so extreme it's rather anarchy than hyper-romantism. Meticulously executed by the Berliners\n\n\\* Scherchen / Vienna State Opera and RPO — this one is a pure mad genius. Nothing left in place, everything is extreme (check Eroica and the 8th!)\n\n\\* Ormandy / PO — AVOID the Sony box, it is completely dead (killed by re-mastering). I have it on vinyl, and there are scattered reissues of selected symphonies. The warm, enveloping Philadelphia sound and emotional deepness.\n\n\\* Klemperer — the earlier is the recording, the better it is musically, but the worse it is technically. Two '50s sets with Philharmonia are okay in both senses. Very powerful, dangerous, looming Beethoven. “Teutonic” is the best word I can use here (hope Otto's spirit will forgive me for that).\n\n**Others**\n\nThese are sets that are interesting in some specific aspect and gives you the better understanding of how endlessly interpretable the symphonies are:\n\n\\* Leibowitz / RPO — was the first to play the symphonies using the author's metronome marks (many believe Beethoven's metronome was broken), and the only one to avoid slipping into a chapiteau show.\n\n\\* Harnoncourt / COE — I personally don't care about 'authenticity', but Harnoncourt made it very interesting: using contrasting sound of orchestra groups, he reveals the internal conflicts in the fabric of the music; some 'postmodern' reading. I was also privileged to listen 4&amp;5 live in one of the last Harnoncourt's concerts — it was majestic.\n\n\\* Rattle / VPO — Sir Simon focuses a lot on subtleties. He might be the only one to bother the difference between p and pp, etc. Recommended for those, who want to \\_study\\_ the music\n\n**If you want:**\n\n\\* speed, pathos, violins on fire — take Toscanini, or of modern incarnations, Vänskä or Chailly/Gewandhaus, Haitink/LPO\n\n\\* sentimental, thoughtful, soulful — Walter/Columbia or Wand (or several of Stokowski's recordings)\n\n\\* clear, transparent, selfless — Schmidt-Isserstedt, or maybe Celibidache\n\n\\* something to start with, \"just fine\" — late Karajan or any Bernstein\n\n\\* romantic breath, extremities, Apocalypse, swan songs, weltschmerz — Furtwäengler\n\n**Conductors I heard in concert with Beethoven and liked:**\n\n\\* Nezet-Seguin — WAY better live than in recording, No. 8 was great\n\n\\* Welser-Möst — appears to me the strongest Beethovenist of our time, comparable maybe to Rattle only (of whom I, unfortunately, had no chance to listen live)\n\n\\* Blomstedt — No. 3 with Gewandhaus was exceptionally strong\n\n(there is a long list of dislikes I would rather omit)\n\n**Honorable Mentions**\n\n\\* Erich and Carlos Kleiber. None of them recorded the full cycle, but what they left is precious\n\n\\* Early Bruno Walter (pre-'50s) — energetic, mercurial performance\n\n\\* LIVE Szell — unlike the studio set, his scarce live recordings show completely different picture; check Salzburg recordings with VPO!",

Of course, many people don’t really pay attention and might not even know it’s happening, but it’s actually hard *not* to notice.\n\nThere are posters all over the city, competition-related clips on the screens in public transport, trams and metro decorated with the theme, **a tram with a piano inside and live music**, and the Competition is broadcast in various public spaces (not only in Warsaw).\n\nBut my favourite thing is that some of the participants give recitals in a local community centre - not in a grand concert hall or prestigious venue, but a neighbourhood cultural centre (though I assume it must have a decent concert room). Of course, the tickets were gone long ago.\n\nAnd of course, it’s all over the media. One of the major newspapers not only publishes daily reviews but also includes short updates in its newsletter. It’s all kind of awesome.",

    "content": "Today (Oct 12), I learned about the German composer and lutenist Sylvius Leopold Weiss, who was born on this day in 1687. Considered the greatest and most technically accomplished lutenist of his time, he left behind an enormous body of work for the instrument (over 650 pieces!).\n\nBut what truly captured my imagination is his connection to Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nAccording to historical accounts, the two were friends and reportedly enjoyed challenging each other in improvisation sessions. The mere thought of being in a room and hearing Bach and Weiss improvise together gives me chills. Two giants of the Baroque era sharing their genius in real time.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with his work, here is a beautiful performance of his Lute Sonata in D minor. The elegance and complexity are stunning.\n\n'Lute Sonata in D minor'  \n[https://youtu.be/PW4ppQKmehI](https://youtu.be/PW4ppQKmehI)\n\nFor those who want to delve deeper, this playlist of his complete suites is a treasure trove.\n\nS.L.

    "content": "I’m a professional orchestral musician, posting anonymously for obvious reasons.\n\nA short piece ran in *Private Eye* last week about something that’s barely been discussed but affects hundreds of freelance players across the UK.\n\nThe Philharmonia Orchestra — which proudly calls itself *“a world-class symphony orchestra for the 21st century”* — has recently **removed itself from the Musicians’ Union (MU) Preferred Contractor list** after a dispute over pay for freelance players (known internally as “E&amp;Ds” — extras and deputies).\n\nHere’s the issue:\n\nFor broadcast work (like BBC Proms concerts), freelancers traditionally receive a **“media buy-out”** payment — usually **£75–£90** — on top of their basic session fee. The BBC’s contract with orchestras includes this money specifically to pay performers when concerts are broadcast or recorded.\n\nThe Philharmonia has now **scrapped these payments entirely**, replacing them with a **£3-per-session pay rise** instead.\n\nAccording to the Musicians’ Union, this change was made **without consultation**. When the MU eventually obtained a list of the Philharmonia’s regular freelancers and ran a private consultation, **97% of respondents rejected** the new deal — but by that time, it had already been implemented and enforced.\n\nThe MU is now considering a **boycott of future Philharmonia projects** that rely heavily on freelancers. But realistically, it’s hard to see that working. Most freelancers can’t afford to turn down work, especially without confidence that their colleagues would do the same — and the MU doesn’t have a strong precedent for this kind of coordinated action.\n\nThe bigger issue is what happens to that BBC money. If the corporation allocates  Licence Fee funds to pay performers, and the orchestra diverts those payments for other use, that raises serious ethical (and potentially contractual) questions. Should they really be allowed to take that BBC performer money, and spend it on private commercial ventures with no benefit to Licence Fee payers for example??\n\nHere’s the *Private Eye* piece that first mentioned it (from “Lunchtime O’Boulez”):\n\n&gt;\n\nI’m curious to hear from other players, contractors, or anyone connected to the orchestral world — has anything similar happened in your organisation? How do we stop this “race to the bottom” before it becomes the new normal?",

The Paris Conservatoire Orchestra (1828-1967), formally the Orchestra of the Concert Society of the Paris Conservatoire, had a very distinctive sonic profile, even compared to other French orchestras of the time. The strings sound dry, the woodwinds nasal and tangy (especially the double reeds), and the brass (with the exception of the horns, which sound watery) bright and piercing with a healthy dose of vibrato. The combined effect is that the sound of the orchestra is extremely transparent. This quality of theirs was put to great use in these two recordings. The Götterdämmerung excerpts utilised, I believe, the largest contingent of the orchestra ever assembled for the studio (alas, they never recorded Mahler). Schumann’s Third Symphony was, of course, written when his orchestration was starting to get very thick—take a listen to the fourth movement, I must say I’m not a fan of Schuricht‘s choice basic tempo for the movement, but each individual brass instrument has never sounded so separated as on this recording.",

    "content": "Today, I discovered the story of Emil Bohnke, a German composer who was born on this day in 1888. His story is a poignant reminder of how easily a significant musical voice can be lost to history.\n\nBohnke was a respected musician on the Berlin scene, performing as a violist and conducting the Berlin Symphony Orchestra. His own compositions were deeply rooted in the late-Romantic tradition, yet he pushed the boundaries by incorporating expressionistic elements and daring harmonies.\n\nHowever, his life was tragically cut short. In 1928, aged just 39, he and his wife were killed in a car accident while searching for a holiday home for their young son.\n\nThis was the first tragedy. The second came just a few years later with the rise of the Nazis. As Bohnke's wife, Lilli (née von Mendelssohn), was of Jewish descent, his music was banned. A promising career, already cut short by a fatal accident, was now systematically erased from history. (Lilli was indeed from the famous Mendelssohn family: a direct descendant of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, and related to the composer Felix Mendelssohn.)\n\nListening to his work today, it is hard not to wonder what might have been. Here is a lyrical piece of his, titled \"Nocturne\".\nhttps://youtu.be/zxDJohk-0qQ\n\nThe most heartbreakingly beautiful part of this story is that the pianist in this recording is Robert-Alexander Bohnke, the son who lost his parents in the car crash. He grew up to become a pianist, and in this recording, he performs his father's work.\n\nFor those who want to explore more, here is a playlist of Emil Bohnke's compositions.\n\nEmil Bohnke – Playlist\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAQZOrY73zxX_TKS8edrF_oIY--JPqDur",

I do enjoy the Preludes and Ballades the most, but would they be wise picks?

    "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI’m a composer, improviser, and music educator at a music university in Japan. Through my work with students, I’ve become convinced of something essential:\n\nMusic is not only about technique – it enriches the heart, connects people, and nurtures growth.\n\n\nYet I often hear: “Theory is too hard for me” or “I don’t like solfège.”\nThat’s why I want to share a different perspective: theory, history, and solfège are not dry, academic subjects – they are keys that open the door to deeper musical expression.\n\nTheory trains us to think musically, not just read notes.\n\nHistory shows us the cultural and human choices behind each sound.\n\nSolfège connects theory and history, uniting learning and expression.\n\n\nWhen taught this way, these subjects are not chores, but foundations for a more authentic understanding of music.\n\nIn this series, I’ll use the scale as a simple but powerful example. We often memorize the major scale as “whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half.” But instead of rote memorization, what if we approached scales as structures of beauty—shapes that carry history, balance, and expressive color?\n\n👉 In the next post (Part 2), I’ll dive into the major scale and show you why its internal symmetry gives it such timeless beauty. I’ll also share some diagrams so you can see and feel it directly.\n\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing this journey with you!",

I just remember it resolving in a tidier, more conventional way. But I’ve been humming what I thought sounded familiar into Google song search and Shazam, and Google searching if other melodies come from it, and I can’t find a single thing.\n\nDoes anyone know why this sounds so familiar?

Other institutes/conservatoires who also livestream competitions of various composers or festivals? Could you guys recommend something? Possibly many so that i can put them on whenever, cause the chopin competition livestreams will end in a few days and i already dread it.\n\nIs there maybe a place that always livestreams? Like maybe some opera houses post a costant livestream on their channels?\n\nPs. I know i can just listen to recorded stuff and search for pieces and their best renditions but there's something magical in listening to something live\n\n(I also don't have a tv and plan on doing no subscriptions anywhere so recommend only stuff i can listen to easily online please)",

    "content": "The straight answer is probably yes, I should listen and judge for myself. But hear me out, this post can be a larger discussion about Mahler. Feel free to leave your thoughts on any of the points below (esp symphony 5).   \n\nI started listening to Mahler about 6 months ago. So far I’ve heard symphonies 1, 2, 4, 5, and Das Lied Von der Erde, and some songs. \n\n- The das lied is an undisputed masterpiece. No need to say more.\n- No. 4 I fell in love with immediately. That first movement is the most inspired Mahler has ever been (within what I heard so far) and I will die on this hill. \n- No. 1 is delightful(can you spot my classical leanings yet?). The scherzo is amazing and the whole thing is quite fun to listen to. \n- No. 5 was a tough one. But after some struggle and checking out different recordings, I came to appreciate it. I knew and loved the 5th mvt already but it took some time to enjoy the first two. Now I do think they’re glorious when I’m in the right mood. The problem is that the rest comes out of nowhere. It feels incoherent (I found out that Mahler wrote the last three mvts significantly after the first two and when he was in a much better mood, and the disconnect shows in my opinion). In recordings that get the first two right, I lose interest in the last three, and those that get the scherzo right at least leave me wanting more in the first two. So to summarize, even though I enjoy the symphony, it’s not without its problems.\n- No. 2 is my least favorite. Try as I could to like it, I just can’t. There some good moments here and there and the last mvt gets progressively better with a glorious ending that in all honestly once brought tears to my eyes. But can I sit through 1.5 hours of meh just so I can experience a few minutes of greatness? Turns out I can’t. I would gladly go to a concert performance of this symphony, but I don’t think I’ll listen to it on my own again. I don’t know.   \n\nHere comes my issue with the 3rd. I read somewhere that it’s a lot like the 2nd and less like the 1st and 4th. It’s another pretty long symphony, and given how long it took me appreciate the 5th and my attempts with the 2nd, I’m expecting to put in 7-8 hours of listening before I can form my own judgment. My question is, given my reaction to the various works above, is it worth it? Is it like the 2nd in that it takes forever to get to that good moment and not much beyond that?   \n\nAgain, please don’t take this post as a yes/no answer because I’d like to hear what all your opinions on Mahler are.",

    "content": "My education and experience with classical music is fairly limited so this is just based on my perceptions. When I learned about the history of classical music it was generally presented in terms of periods from baroque to classical to romantic. The renaissance period before that and the 20th century period after that were certainly acknowledged, and some attention paid to trends within the periods, but broadly speaking, when I read about this stuff as a teenager I was presented with three eras with J.S. Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven held up as exemplars of each style.\n\nNow I loved all that but I wonder if it gave me a distorted view of what was actually going on musically in those eras. My academic background is in history and I could go on forever about the problems of retroactive periodisation. I feel there must have been 19th century composers who were old fashioned and wanted to write baroque-style fugues or a Haydn symphony I haven’t heard that has a 12 tone serialist movement. Well, maybe not the latter…\n\nIn any case I’m just looking for the composers who, in your opinion, might have been overlooked because they don’t conform to modern ideas of the time they came from. The ones that slipped through the cracks of history not because they were against the grain necessarily, but because modern listeners couldn’t fit them in neatly to the narrative",

But when it comes to promoting my music I can’t say I know what I’m doing. I’m really struggling to reach a wider audience. This is my profession and I love the music I make but now that I’ve released it and it seems like it’s not going anywhere I’m starting to question whether my piece is good at all. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? And what should I do to reach a bigger audience? Or is the music just not good? \n\nHere’s a link to the music \n\nSpotify: \nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/6V8XcYXPom5FuH8lTqlivn?si=tbe7-1QOQ9iuH93JRdLfDw\n\nBandcamp:\nhttps://theekshana.bandcamp.com/track/we-live-and-breathe",

Within the presentation, they had the examples of the same composition transposed to multiple different keys by the composer, and due to the transposition they had different colour effects on the composer and had different names.   \n  \nFor example, if the first piece was called \"Red Clouds/Lake/Forest/Trees at Dawn\" the others were named \"Green Clouds/Lake/Forest/Trees at Dawn\" \"Blue Clouds/Lake/Forest/Trees at Dawn\". The names were also not in English (I want to say French or Spanish). \n\n\n\nI realise this is incredibly vague but I'm on a mission for a friend to find these songs.

    "content": "Today, I would like to reflect on a notable and contentious event in Japanese musical history: the official opening of the New National Theatre, Tokyo, on 10 October 1997.\n\nFor the theatre's opening performance, the opera Takeru (composed by Ikuma Dan) premiered in the presence of the Emperor and Empress of Japan.\n\nThe theatre's opening was fraught with difficulties, sparking what became known as the 'Second National Theatre Problem'. I distinctly recall the heated debates in music magazines at the time. To be honest, at the time, I had a somewhat negative impression of Japanese-language operas based on national mythology, feeling that they were rather nationalistic.\n\nNow, however, I find it fascinating. Although I have many memories associated with this theatre, I must admit that I am listening to the commissioned opera Takeru for the first time today. This work premiered on this very day 28 years ago.\n\nFor those interested in this piece of Japanese operatic history, here are some links. Does anyone here have memories of this theatre or thoughts on this opera?\n\n\"Takeru\" Act 1  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfbDWn5JD4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnfbDWn5JD4)\n\n\"Takeru\" Act 2  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5oY8JtZceo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5oY8JtZceo)\n\n\"Takeru\" Act 3  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn-ducb7OCk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn-ducb7OCk)",

I mean, the name of the piece is a hint, and it was written roughly in the same era, and musically speaking, the characteristics in each movement somehow vividly reflect on the happiness, hardships, tranquility, homesickness, despair and all sorts of other emotions of Americans, European settlers, indigenous population and so on during that time.\n\nI'm well aware of the background of this composition and the inspiration it draws from, but I kinda failed to find analysis from this perspective. Am I over thinking? Or maybe this is just one way to look at this magnificent work.",

I have never had trouble getting into the heavier stuff (Webern is my favourite composer, really like Boulez, Busotti, Schoenberg, Nono, Xenakis, etc.), into any modal composers contemporary with debussy (really like faure, like most of Ravel) or into any of those that explore somewhat similar types of sonorities from then on (Murail, Grisey, Dufourt, Scelsi...), with a somewhat similar management of structure and economy of musical material.\n\nHowever, for some strange reason, after years trying I really, really dislike (almost) all of Debussy for no reason. I've tried to hear la mer several times, bored to death, same with suite bergamesque, same with faun prelude (whatever it's long french name is xD), and the list goes on. \n\nOnly thing I really like from him is the string quartet op. 10, which I really like.\n\nCan't pinpoint why this is the case and I believe it has got something to with myself, but I can't explain it or articulate it in any manner. You know what can be that I find so boring? Have you ever felt something like that with any composer?",

While I think there is a general consensus on what constitutes “good” and “bad” music (i.e. it’s less subjective, per se, than many believe), once we actually get into “good” music, opinions will vary drastically. What I want to know is: What makes — if anything, I guess — Canon in D so special from a “technical” perspective?

You can find that post here:  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1nxnmnw/october\\_4\\_a\\_quiet\\_joy\\_a\\_defining\\_moment\\_a/.\n\nOne of the pieces I first heard there was Saint-Saëns's 'The Swan'. I absolutely loved it, and it was the first time I had consciously recognised the cello as a distinct instrument. It truly opened my ears.\n\nHowever, there's another, more hazy memory attached to this piece, and I'm hoping this community can help solve a little mystery for me!\n\nI vividly remember a female figure skater performing an exhibition to 'The Swan' at the Olympics. Her elegance was unforgettable. For years, I was convinced it was Dorothy Hamill, but a recent search shows no record of her using that music.\n\nDoes anyone else remember this? Or am I just creating a false memory? It's been bugging me for a while!\n\nTo celebrate his birthday, here is a fantastic, high-energy performance of Fazıl Say's Piano Concerto No. 2. It's not a piece you hear every day, but in his hands, it's absolutely thrilling!\n\nSaint-Saëns – Piano Concerto No. 2 (Fazıl Say): [https://youtu.be/-9TX8RQJQ8c](https://youtu.be/-9TX8RQJQ8c)\n\nAlso born on this day were the great Hungarian violinist, **Carl Flesch**, and the elegant Polish pianist, **Regina Smendzianka**.

Granted, I was getting more into synth arranging so the two went hand in hand for this piece. Score is in the video. \n\n(Some notes that are also in the video description ) This piece was closely modeled after Carlos Salzedo’s “Siciliana\" from his Suite of Eight Dances for harp (1943). It is scored for prophet rev 2 (main harp and pad) sampled acoustic guitar, along with a few logic pro soft synths for layering. It was created by first performing it as a piano piece on midi keyboard, then separating out some of the midi information to orchestrate and layer with different sound sources, retaining the loose, expressive quality of a performance.\n\nI'm struggling a little bit with some of the bassy/buzzing artifacts from my left-hand synth patch in the mix, and while I tried my best to neaten it up, the score is handwritten. I hope you can still hear/see well enough to get the idea. Thank you!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nec9Pgs0rzw&amp;t=33s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nec9Pgs0rzw&amp;t=33s)",

Here are, for each of my favorite composers, the movements that I think deserve far more appreciation than they receive. What are yours?\n\nBeethoven: mov. I of symphony 4. The way the introduction quietly creeps in, slowly swelling until it bursts into an explosion of joy, is possibly my single favorite moment in all of classical music.\n\nTchaikovsky: I've read many times that symphony 3 is supposed to be his worst one and I just don't get it. Movs I and IV are very strong, but my favorite is definitely mov V: it starts with exhilarating energy, keeps building and building, constantly delaying the resolution, and ends in a final, sensational blast.\n\nDvorak: I love all his works from symphony 3 onward. Among his less performed works, I particularly enjoy mov III of his fourth symphony. I don't know why but it makes me think of pirates-related videogames and movies, like Monkey Island or Pirates of the Caribbean. Runners up are probably III from 6, III and IV from 5, and I from 3.\n\nSchubert: I from 2\n\nSchumann: while 3 is the most famous, I personally feel it’s mostly carried by its first two movements, whereas his other symphonies are more consistent throughout. III from 4 is particularly good, as II and III from 2.\n\nMendelssohn: I and III from the first symphony.\n\nMozart: probably not overlooked as such, but I think the entire Symphony No. 28 deserves to be talked about more. Also, I from 27.\n\nI'm eager to read your suggestions for great but relatively underappreciated movements, so thanks in advance to anyone who'll share their personal list.",

You can go back to listen, read up, and discuss the work if you want to. \n\nOur next Piece of the Week is **Wilhelm Stenhammar’s Symphony no.2 in g minior (1915)**\n\n… \n\n**Score from IMSLP**: \n\nhttps://s9.imslp.org/files/imglnks/usimg/7/7f/IMSLP517592-PMLP92178-Stenhammar_op.34_Symphony_No.2_mov1_fs_CGM_(etc).pdf\n\n…\n\nSome listening notes from [P-G. Bergfors](https://www.naxos.com/MainSite/BlurbsReviews/?itemcode=8.553888&amp;catnum=553888&amp;filetype=AboutThisRecording&amp;language=English):\n\n&gt; One reason for Stenhammar’s doubts regarding his first symphony was that, when listening to it critically, he realised that its musical language was too strongly influenced by his admiration for Wagner, Bruckner and Brahms. Another even more important reason was that only a month or so before the first performance of the F major Symphony he had attended a performance of the Second Symphony of his friend Jean Sibelius and had been completely bowled over by it. Compared to that, he asked himself, what was his own first attempt as a symphonist worth?\n\n&gt; Working with the Göteborgs orchestra, Stenhammar made a point of performing a great deal of new Nordic music. In the late autumn of 1910 he conducted the Symphony No. 1 in G minor by Carl Nielsen. During the rehearsals for this performance he realised that his own composing had to take on a new direction and perhaps it was this that made him want to attempt a new symphony once more. Stenhammar wrote to Nielsen shortly afterwards:\n\n&gt; ’Your symphony does not try to ingratiate itself with the audience, nor is it, thank God, either blandly smooth or sensational. For me its greatest value is its very Nordic chastity and formal simplicity, which I find so bracing in these sensually voluptuous times. I know that you have always tried and also succeeded in warding off the influence of Wagner and I am increasingly convinced that that is the only possible way for us Nordic people, if we are to create our own style.’\n\n&gt; A few months later, travelling in Italy, Stenhammar started on his new symphony, which it would take him four years to complete. Its character would indeed be quite different from that of its predecessor and shot through with the qualities he valued most highly in the Nielsen symphony. His intention was, he said, to write ‘lucid and honest music without vulgar showiness’. The orchestral forces now used are much smaller than in the Brucknerian instrumentation of the First Symphony, the composer taking a stand against the voluptuous sounds of Late Romanticism and Impressionism. An ascetic trait in Stenhammar is also apparent from his choice of the Dorian mode, for that is what he has chosen, rather than the key of G minor which is usually given as the key of the symphony.\n\n&gt; Once more Stenhammar wanted to put melody and melodic lines at the centre of things. He wanted to compose a symphony that was ‘Nordic’ in character and he was very pleased when a friend of his told him that ‘he could hear the rustle of the tall pines in the first movement’ and that he ‘found the air bracing’. He also wanted to make use of what he had learnt from further studies in counterpoint during the last few years, a task he had undertaken to lessen his feelings of inferiority brought on by his lack of formal training in composition. It is safe to assume that he saw the activities of some other Scandinavian composers, whom he held in particularly high regard, as a challenge to him – Hugo Alfvén, whose Second Symphony ends with a virtuosic fugal finale, Jean Sibelius, who had, in 1915, reached his Fifth Symphony and Carl Nielsen, who was at the same time working on his Fourth Symphony, ‘The Inextinguishable’.\n\n&gt; The first movement of Stenhammar’s DDD Symphony, Op. 34, marked Allegro energico, mixes Swedish folk music with vocal polyphony. It begins with a theme pregnant with possibilities, reminiscent of an ancient dance tune. The second movement, marked Andante, has a wandering and elegiac character similar to that of the corresponding movement in Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony. It is a solemn march or an ancient funeral procession, which Stenhammar said was rhythmically inspired by the Prometheus Bound of Aeschylus. The main theme of the Scherzo again gives the impression of a folk dance. In the Trio horns and woodwind dominate, an act of homage to a group of musicians in his orchestra for which Stenhammar had particular admiration. The Finale has been described as something of a Grosse Fuge for orchestra. It is a magnificent complex of fugues and fugato passages, based on only two thematic ideas that are themselves interrelated.\n\n&gt; ’On the whole I am happy with the symphony, so happy that I am beginning to long for the next one’, Stenhammar wrote to Sibelius, a month or so after its first performance. The Dorian symphony, however, was the only one he released for publication. It is true that some years later he worked on a Symphony in C major, and of the first movement Allegro some seven pages of completed score have been preserved. What the rest of the symphony was to sound like is very difficult to deduce from the very incomplete sketches. In a letter dated January 1919 Stenhammar confessed to his fellow composer Ture Rangström: ‘I have been wracked by a damned self-criticism which only gets worse as the years go by. So maybe I had better call a complete stop soon.’\n\n\n**Ways to Listen**\n\n* Vassily Sinaisky and the BBC Philharmonic: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRTHNl2hrG8) **Score Video**\n\n* Warwick Stengårds and the Australian Doctors Orchestra: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ur00B0mzZU)\n\n* Christian Lindberg and the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE2RT4vllAM), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3I4ili99x5hsOyXpxvoIAT?si=pqVoFJ_AQli7qAppNvD5EQ)\n\n* Stig Westerberg and the Stockholms Filharmoniska Orkester: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ey3wdhE1OI&amp;pp=ygUVc3RlbmhhbW1hciBzeW1waG9ueSAy), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3cJptzWwb7gYUKorZLiVPM?si=LM7pF6ybTPOnEiBaw5Cviw)\n\n* Herbert Blomstedt and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0BX5XFvvcQa6nOCM0kirbl?si=T8CHn8GXShelkMSvLSUA9g)\n\n* Neeme Järvi and the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6hdVjcbJXiVt1Vw5vfsv2Z?si=HxM0FhntQYiHys5tzDvhKw)\n\n* Paavo Järvi and the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4kxSW3zPvnj9udlmofwgOe?si=SE37fCZ9QmmJTBDMCfvM5Q)\n\n* Petter Sundkvist and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra: [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4fiWOs5VFf2veO7UbVeVlK?si=Tadknv24S3-hvZjpDZpuww)\n\n\n**Discussion Prompts**\n\n* What are your favorite parts or moments in this work?

    "content": "Hi everyone, I’ve been surrounded by immense worries and fears about my future, and I wanted to hear your opinions and advice. I completed my BM in Music Performance and am currently pursuing an MM in Performance at a big university. Lately, I’ve realized just how competitive and uncertain this path is, and the kinds of careers I had hoped for—such as faculty positions or research roles—no longer seem ideal. They are also extremely competitive. \n\nI’m starting to have significant regrets. As an international student, I’m worried about whether I should continue pursuing a DMA. I’ve looked into related fields like musicology, music therapy, and music cognition, but they also seem less than ideal because of low pay and limited job opportunities. I’m highly intelligent and a very dedicated musician, but I often struggle with developing soft skills. Critically, I’m neurodivergent and have some learning disabilities, which makes communication especially challenging (also with mental health issues). My life was already quite difficult in my home country. The only two things I’ve felt truly confident in—music performance and research (especially, music-related field, philosophy, and psychology)—now feel uncertain in terms of my ability to build a stable future in the U.S. after graduation. I’m trying to view my future realistically, which has been mentally and emotionally challenging. \n\nI’m wondering if anyone here has had similar experiences, switched majors, or pursued alternative degrees. I would deeply appreciate any advice or perspective about my circumstances and options.",

    "title": "The Home County - Video Game Soundtrack",
    "content": "Hi everyone! I wanted to share the fantastic work of my composer, James Smith.\n\nThe Home County is a game about building a village in the British countryside. For the soundtrack, we wanted to do something like 'Vivaldi's Four Seasons but for Britain's historical eras.'\n\n**Roman Era**\n\n*Mines of the Legionnaire* and *Spirits from Empires Below*\n\nWe were incredible fortunate to have the Grammy nominated woodwind specialist Sandro Friedrich to record a number of layered flutes including the pivana, occorso, zurna and the bouzouki. The light and lilting nature of these interwoven lines immediately immerses you in an ancient era. Underpinning the flute layers we have lyres and the Roman war drums but the instrument that stands out to us is the Cornu, an ancient Roman military brass instrument.\n\n**Saxon Era**\n\n*March of The Pickaxe, Saxon Ancestors and Under the Barrow Downs*\n\nThe Saxons were a challenge to blend into the game’s existing sound world, so we leaned into folk music and ritualistic elements using wooden flutes, penny whistle, and medieval fiddle. After experimenting widely, we discovered the hurdy-gurdy and collaborated with Vicki Swan, whose mastery of the nyckelharpa brought new texture and drive. This led to an ensemble of fiddle, nyckelharpa, and octav-harpa layered with orchestra, creating the warm, resonant sound heard in *March of the Pickaxe.*\n\n***Viking Era***\n\n*Hammerfall in The Deep*\n\nThe Viking Mines section aimed to capture a Viking sound without relying on clichés, using unique instruments like the carynx, ram’s horns, and nyckelharpa to create an earthy, resonant tone. Recordings in a stone church enhanced the cavernous feel, while rhythmic Viking drums tied it all together.\n\n**Victorian/Edwardian Era**\n\n*Song Beneath the Sun, When Seasons Turn or Spring Dance*\n\nThis era draws inspiration from Downton Abbey and The Shire, using gentle orchestral themes that unify the game’s weather, characters, and areas. Influenced by Victorian/Edwardian composers like Elgar, Holst, and Vaughan Williams, it blends pastoral warmth with graceful 3/4 rhythms for a cosy, nostalgic feel.\n\nYou can listen on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/the-home-county-original-game-soundtrack/1844443367) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6k7ACYxlRT9gCDu1LbNUdI) or [YouTube Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGjQAgZeyCE&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nJzg5eslRVSMci--LwmKdydCcagFUvWyQ&amp;index=2).\n\nThe composer is [James Smith](http://facebook.com/jamessmithcomposer), who I would wholeheartedly recommend.",

You could also do the same for other works like Rite of Spring or a Mahler symphony in order for them to not be only restricted to top tier ensembles.

His personal life was also famously vibrant and included his marriage to the legendary pianist Martha Argerich. This video from their \"honeymoon\" days offers a fascinating glimpse into their partnership: [https://youtu.be/daP2N1JPv3s](https://youtu.be/daP2N1JPv3s)\n\nFor me, Dutoit's 1980 recording of Fauré's opera Pénélope holds a special place. Recordings of this opera are incredibly rare. When I first heard this one at age 20, it became a cornerstone of my musical world.  \n[https://youtu.be/t1W2e-Y0AS0](https://youtu.be/t1W2e-Y0AS0)\n\nHowever, it's impossible to ignore the serious allegations of misconduct that emerged against him in 2017. While he has been largely ostracized in the West, his career has continued in other parts of the world, including Japan.\n\nThis raises a difficult question that we often face in the classical world: How do we separate the art from the artist? Or should we? It's something I continue to grapple with.",

It feels more like a \"technically impressive piano performance\" than a song, which to me is supposed to evoke a mood or tell a story. I just have a hard time processing all the notes into such a structure in my head. (I also listened to a bunch of songs by Chopin and others and had a similar experience)\n\nFor those familiar with instrumental guitar, it's similar to how a lot of people comment on how they feel Yngwie Malmsteen or Polyphia as technically impressive guitar picking but feels soulless (opinion is definitely divided on this) but I don't really see these complaints about fast piano music so I'm presuming it's my fault and not just a taste issue.

I adore this piece, but to me it feels like a bird flying freely until it suddenly hits a wall and falls in grief and despair. I want the opposite. I want something that starts hopeless and has a twist that feels like rising through the midst of the darkness, not in a defiant way but in a hopeful, like a warm light kind of way. I know that sounds rly abstract but I can’t think of how else to describe it. Tchaikovsky and Chopin are my favorite composers for reference, but I’m happy with anyone really as long as it embodies the description that I tried to explain. Thank you so much!",

    "content": "I’m an usher in a hall, and since many people seem to ask questions about going to concerts for the first time, here’s my guide:                                  \n\n-Outfits: nobody really cares about what you’re wearing, but I’d encourage anyone going to a concert to dress nicely, while being comfortable.                                                      \n\n-Arrive early: when I say early, it’s not 5/10 minutes before the concert, especially if it’s your first time. The seating is sometimes confusing, and we cannot have people standing up while the concert has started.                                     \n\n-Prepare your tickets ahead of time: have them paper or on a pdf, and have them ready BEFORE we scan tickets. The line is long enough to have people looking for their tickets right in front of us.                                                                \n\n-Try to find your seat alone, but ask if you’re unsure: lots of time I’ve seen people sitting at the wrong seat and having to check their tickets to make understand what is happening.                                                        \n\n-Do not film unless specifically told that you can: if you want to complain, go ahead, but you cannot film. In doubt, ask us, we’re here for that. (If you do wanna film, do it discreetly please).                                                                   \n\n-No open glass, and no drinking in the hall: exceptionally if you’re coughing, you can take a sip of water. Preferably tho drink before, we cannot risk having a water bottle empty itself on the ground.                        \n\n-Others: don’t complain if you can’t go in because you’re late, don’t take phone calls in the middle of the concert, don’t ask me if I’m married, say hi, if your baby is crying please go out, and please leave the elevators for people who actually need it.  \n\n-Ask us: we’re here to help you. If you’re unsure about the rules, if you wanna know something about the music being played, if you want pictures of you during the intermission, please just ask us.             \n\n\nIt might seem like a lot, but I think most of this is basic human decency (although many people seem not to understand it). Please remember that these rules apply only to my hall, but I’m pretty sure that many other halls have similar rules. Feel free to add things in the comments!",

However, it’s frequently guilty of exactly this and I was worried I may get defensive responses. \n\nWhilst 9 times out of 10 I will be able to decipher the implied clef and key signature, why make it harder than it needs to be? The onus is not meant to be on the reader to guess what was intended.\n\nIf I had to speculate, I’d say this happens mostly because musicians crop lazily, forgetting that others won’t know the context they’re already familiar with. \n\nBut clarity is an essential skill in discussing or writing music. It can be difficult to analyse or appreciate a score if I’m uncertain what pitches I’m meant to be looking at.\n\nIs this an unreasonable expectation? \n\nEdit: “are” not “is” in the title.",

For those who missed it, you can find that discussion here:  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/classicalmusic/comments/1njygwi/til\\_that\\_one\\_of\\_the\\_first\\_operas\\_composed\\_by\\_a/.\n\nWhile Francesca's legacy is more widely known, Settimia was also a celebrated singer and respected composer. It's incredible to think of this single family producing two of the most important female musical figures of the entire Baroque era.\n\nThough most of Settimia's works have been lost, this surviving piece gives us a glimpse into her talent. Now, let's listen to the voice of the \"other\" Caccini sister, a trailblazer who deserves to be remembered.\n\nSettimia Caccini — \"Già a sperai, non spero hor' più\"  \n[https://youtu.be/toHD3BAQfNU](https://youtu.be/toHD3BAQfNU)",
