How have you all been? It's great to host Yummy Yummy Yummy as I've been excitedly waiting for this drama to air, especially after WDBTD, I'm in love with Wang Yinglu! This is also my third time hosting a drama, so please be patient and guide me in case I'm doing something wrong! Along with me, u/sequesteredself will also be co-hosting, so I'm really looking forward to these episodic discussions! The first four episodes have been such a ride! They were so enjoyable that I couldn't hit the pause button, and I binged-watched all of them together. One thing I wasn't prepared for was all the cooking scenes, I was so tempted by food that this time I actually cooked some dishes before starting the show and watched while eating lol Let's now dive into the episodes right in! Be warned of spoilers! The show starts with the hint that Lin Yan is very interested in joining Princess Fuhui's Qixi Banquet, while also considering breaking up the engagement with Jicai to not implicate her and her family in his family's matter. He also allows the Shen Family to borrow anything they need, which is fully taken advantage of by the said family and takes almost everything away for their stall😂 [''They were certainly polite'', he is so sarcastic 😂😂](https://preview.redd.it/w3cs8jeb9cuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f2ebb0d820c54fb3620670eb47aea276e225bb2) To my pleasant surprise, I find Li Yunrui very refreshing and mesmerising in this drama; his expressions are really good and expressive, sometimes even funny. I somehow keep remembering Song Mo, but these two people are so, so different! Li Yunrui truly is an amazing actor. Next, Jicai faces trouble in business as their competitor copies their recipe and are selling a better version of the pancake in lower price. Their business doesn't do well and they retire home, taking the competitor's pancakes for their ''family meeting''. Everyone finds them tasty, even Lin Yan. He even retracts calling them tasty, seeing Shen Jicai sad (*awwwww so cute, already sensitive to her likings and dislikings hahaha!*) and tries to comfort them. But Shen Jicai tells him not to comfort her and comes up with a new plan. Their next plan is to sell lamb skewers, unique to the people of ancient times, and the buyers line up! I really loved the snail-style stall and the mic head and absolutely amazing how the screen showed live selling feature 😂😂😂 https://preview.redd.it/m9t9g76pacuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34b3b1e86f62dda14142d01ce2be2f6103f96416 The funnier part was that they took all the lambs from their ancestor and sold them for only 10 yuan 😂😂 Lin Yan felt might have felt really guilty 😂 Next, Censorate Pei takes Lin Yan to try the lamb skewers of the Shen Family, unknown to the fact that they are acquaintances, and accidentally witnesses the competitor restaurant people bullying the Shen family. https://preview.redd.it/19bqi7z6dcuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9575380be953d0c5ecc32a05ac01dbdc749652bb Just when the goons were about to throw everything, Lin Yan steps in ( *we know, you wouldn't let anyone lay a hand on your lady, would you?* 😂) and rebukes them for trying to control the market. They realize who Lin Yan is and make excuses to run away. Mother Shen accidentally calls Lin Yan son-in-law, which the Censorate overhears and presses Lin Yan to admit the truth. At first, Censorate Pei doesn't agree to marrying a merchant's daughter, but upon tasting the lamb skewers (*and finishing them lmaoooo*), he starts singing praises for Jicai 😂 https://preview.redd.it/m7z56zmcdcuf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdbe97858fb4486bb2be8b4c7910401aa39708db It must have been very funny to Lin Yan 😂 At night, the Shen Family is rejoicing earning so much money and plans to become more sutainable and time-effective and decides to sell drinks along with the skewers. The next day, we see various sets of drinks with unique idioms as names being sold at Shen's Diner. https://preview.redd.it/rtdd071qdcuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15e0e3e7d148520f81c6a2c706b09daa63caa20d Censorate Pei gets a lamb skewers treat from Lin Yan, who trickily asks why he wanted an advance payment and if he faced any hardship. Pei confesses he wants to buy a selk outfit to fit in at the Princess's Qixi banquet. Lin Yan cleverly suggests buying him one, but Censorate Pei refuses, but quickly suggests of lending one from Lin Yan's clothes. This opens up Lin Yan's opportunity and he earns Censorate Pei's word to receive an invitation to the banquet as well. He also receives an offer for the Shen Family to cook for the banquet. Lin Yan looked fairly interested (and invested because of course, our ML has to look out for his girlfriend's earnings 😂) The drinks are superhit! Buyers line up, and Shen's Diner is completely sold out! Later, some military men come to the stall and offer to have some barrels delivered, to which Jicai refuses because military rations are strictly state-controlled; however, she also suggests selling the recipe to the military since they'll leave Yong'an soon. Besides, the military works hard to serve the country and people, so they deserve to try the best teas of Yong'an. The military general is impressed by her bold idea and buys the recipe. https://preview.redd.it/dzerthrsecuf1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c18ed77984fca049477e04240d046623964003f From far, Lin Yan also witnesses and admires Shen Jicai, saying that had she stayed in Yong'an, she'd become a good merchant. He walks up to the stall and Shen Jicai makes him say the phrase ''Find an ideal husband, Ultra cute maiden purple'', and being unfaily played, Lin Yan gently strikes on her forehead and calls her name intimately, which completely takes Jicai by surprise. [THIS WAS SOOOOOO CUTEEEEEE](https://preview.redd.it/mtlrib0agcuf1.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c91c28262ab4b6af23eff1f6b9955d9fb897746) Anyways, Lin Yan offers her to become the chef at the banquet. **Episode 6** The Shen family at first disagrees to stay out of trouble, but hearing the pay is in gold bar, they agree readily. Shen Jicai is preparing the flower desserts in the kitchen and realises her brother is again bunking work and being lazy. She comes to fetch him for work and even tries fighting, but the lazy brother just pretends to sleep or hurt to avoid the hardwork. Jicai comes back to the kitchen and hears someone walk in. Thinking it's her brother, she tries to knock him with the roller, but Lin Yan stands there. He says he came to check on how the food was being prepared since he was the one who recommended them, but honestly, he was just watching his soon-to-be girlfriend and admiring the Beauty cooking. Now, this here was just sooooo swooooningggg!!!! Did y'all blush?!? I think I kicked and rolled around with giggles and all becuase the next part was sooo cute! Lin Yan gets flour on his face and Jicai gets them all off - touching his face, lips and whatnot and TAHT LOOOOK !! HOT AF !!! Lin Yan is definitely falling, if not already in love with herrrr [😩](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=679517c3ba0a5d08&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifNnotHVfbFCfcH3Diu-3Xm-jzGbPw:1760128566962&amp;q=%F0%9F%98%A9+Weary+Face&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJvvjvvZqQAxUJcGwGHaIDK_sQxccNegUIjAEQAQ) [😩](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=679517c3ba0a5d08&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifNnotHVfbFCfcH3Diu-3Xm-jzGbPw:1760128566962&amp;q=%F0%9F%98%A9+Weary+Face&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJvvjvvZqQAxUJcGwGHaIDK_sQxccNegUIjAEQAQ) [😩](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=679517c3ba0a5d08&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifNnotHVfbFCfcH3Diu-3Xm-jzGbPw:1760128566962&amp;q=%F0%9F%98%A9+Weary+Face&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJvvjvvZqQAxUJcGwGHaIDK_sQxccNegUIjAEQAQ) (get the girl sooneeeer pleaseee) https://preview.redd.it/hqd13vbxgcuf1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0998d7e3796f05d16f1257216a3df3ec23d47ca Then when he starts rolling the dough, Jicai gets her apron and puts it on him (**did y'all get the deja vu and get goosebumps all over just like meee?!?**) He looks very aware and very sensitive and very very taken aback that she is so close to him, touching him. He seems to resist his feelings! https://preview.redd.it/0u2dqw29icuf1.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a11c3fd7ed5e8400e42f4377bcab04626d654246 https://preview.redd.it/esoz6ruaicuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dad23eefa40b8d2d24a5f78cf1c37501a691e07 https://preview.redd.it/x0qfqrndicuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94e5f24b98dd214f7ab07220b79bfb9670bfc263 Jicai luaghs at him for wearing a cute, maiden apron and THAT STEP! That flirtatious expression! LI YUNRUIIIII!!! I really swooned! Lin Yan lightly strikes on her forehead again for teasing him, but Jicai praises him to be a hero and a man of valor. Shen Jicai feeds him a cake and Lin Yan praises it. Jicai tells him she doesn't really like QIxi because the cowherd tricked the weaver girl just because he liked her, reducing her from any kind of freedom and agency. Lin Yan points out that because most poems are written by men, they would never think like this and realise the problem. Jicai vaguely remembers her boyfriend from modern world, how he mocked her for being serious about a drama. Feeling heard, she is impressed by Lin Yan. They prepare the flowercakes together. https://preview.redd.it/tusvkesrjcuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb16bf9e5901668ef73b56a90e6a3d935acff7d4 These two episodes were really cute and wholesome, our leads are already getting close, and Lin Yan is already very sensitive to Jicai's presence! At the banquet, Censorate Pei and Lin Yan sits side by side, praising each other. Lin Yan watches Shen Jicai deliver cakes and mesmerised by the festive scenes, and secretly asks a maid to ask for persmission of the princess for the chef family to attend the banquet as well. Lin Yan also asks Shen Jicai to sit beside him and make tea, while the maid returns with the news that since the Princess is very satisfied with the food they made, she'll allw them to enjoy the banquet. The Shen family gets warned by Mother Shen to be at their best behavior and joins a table with Shen Jicai. Later, the nobles are gathering around notable figures and praising to get attention, flocking around Lin Yan as well. While offering tea, Lin Yan cheers to Jicai, which one noble doesn't like and comes to create an issue when Mother Shen accidentally bumps against him. However, Shen Jicai quickly retaliates, saying trying to kick them out from the banquet would mean he is dissatisfied iwth the princess's taste. This impresses the audiencdes and Lin Yan, who again realises she's bold and fearless. The noble tries to create an issue, but Lin Yan, again, comes and sends him away after threatening him that the princess would soon join. Later, the brother is muttering how it's unfair that people are measured by class, which the owner of the Guixiang Tavern praises him for his statement. Fueled by praises, the brother stands up and farther criticises the high-low ranking system and how men are obsessed with domination and power, instead of giving proper respect as equals. This attends the whole banquet's attention and someone counters that the rank must stay otherwise no son would follow the father and no wife would follow the husband. But the brother insists that in marriage, proper respect and mutual understanding is necessary otherwise they would leave if the men are overbearing and domineering. The women at the banquet are very impressed and praises him, and the Princess also arrives to praise him, but is disappointed to see his ugly face 😂 https://preview.redd.it/pxjrzt46mcuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce945df91160467afbb0b2669c1fe525f7331c07 However, she does praise him for his unique insights and then doesn't stand on ceremony for long, leaving them be. Later, Lin Yan gives Shen Jicai 5 gold bars, saying the Princess provided them along with several yards of silk as reward. But later when the Princess calls her, she finds out that the Princess only gave her some yards of silk , not the gold. Realising they're from Lin Yan, she goes to him to return them, but he refuses to take them, calling it a gratitude for helping him make connection with the Princess. Shen Jicai also thanks him for the intervention during the conflict but Lin Yan only praises her for her rebuttal and calls the other party foul for their behaviour (*right right right, your girl is never the one in fault!*) The two stare and smile at each other with starry eyes (*and fluttering hearts, I hope!)* https://preview.redd.it/3gfpi9hhncuf1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d03da616814be6b4e9ac6689f539cd8b23e6d902 They both flirting like it's nobody's business! invites him to a dinner soon and leaves with the gold. His right-hand man, Liu Chang, sees the bag and remarks how he could give away his salary since entering the service (*myyy, we're giving away assets already!*) He also politely reminds Lin Yan if he was going to dissolve the engagement any time soon and this makes all the color and sweetness fade away from his face. This ends our episodic discussion for 5 and 6! You can find the first four episode discussion here: [Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o23nk6/yummy_yummy_yummy_%E5%AE%B4%E9%81%87%E6%B0%B8%E5%AE%89_2025_what_are_your_first/) I'm honestly so impressed with Wang Yinglu. She is the beauty and the brain, although it does bug me a little that the brother and father are protrayed like this - I think the Shen Family could have been smarter and interesting, but the lazy brother and devoted husband-father concept is also not too bad. Are you guys also watching? What are your thoughts?"", 'Love in the Clouds Episode Discussion - Episodes 28 - 29. Welcome to another episode discussion for **Love in the Clouds**. These two episodes feels a bit unevenly paced for me. But they do complete Situ Ling’s arc and give us some sweet scenes between our lovely couple. But the happier our characters are, the more anxious I get! Thank god we have these episode discussion to function as a support group.

So Bozai did put the Golden Millet Dream in the scallion pancake. (Putting a life-saving medicine in his girl’s favorite food…and here I was thinking the guy can’t possibly get more swoon-worthy…my mistake… [I just can’t resist posting another picture of Bozai spitting blood. ](https://preview.redd.it/nlp0lz8cy5xf1.jpg?width=1638&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd1a546f624424ce1f0ce7a6383d9e43dbd33bcc) And when Buxiu finds out, he became the biggest Bozai/Ming Yi shipper. Granted, Buxiu’s reasons are more practical than romantic, but it does leads to a conversation that is not only funny but also highlighted the difference between Bozai and Situ Ling’s mindset towards Ming Yi. Buxiu: “I wasn’t in favor of your relationship. But now that you’ve put down such a huge betrothal gift, you have to marry her no matter what.” And later. Buxiu: “Now that she know everything. She better be sensible, and marry you immediately to repay you.” Bozai: “No one gives someone a medicine, and expects someone to marry them in return. Further more, why would I want her to repay me? It’s fun watching how Buxiu clucking over Bozai like a mother hen. Buxiu’s fussing over Bozai’s marriage prospects prompts Bozai to suggest that maybe it’s time for Buxiu to find an animal companion of his own. [“In my opinion, you should go meet a female dragon, a little butterfly, or a little phoenix or the like..”](https://preview.redd.it/vym1qwu7y5xf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a6bcc0243d8cd02ce968bbf7c0156529dcdcf68) I would pay good money to see that spin-off. # Situ Ling embraces the dark side Situ Ling, on the other hand, clearly expect something in return for his act of selfless sacrifice. So we get to witness his very short-lived and inept attempt to woo Ming Yi while being thwarted by Bozai at every turn. Honestly, I don’t get why Ming Yi and Bozai must continue to do this thing where they pretend that they are not already a couple and that they didn’t get to know each other in the biblical sense just a few short episodes ago. I am also a little miffed at Ming Yi for not clearly siding with Bozai, thereby giving Situ Ling a chance to act as if he has any claims on her. “You must leave with me Jie Jie…” Gag. [I love the shameless way Bozai uses his status of Ming Yi’s husband to lord over Situ Ling. ](https://preview.redd.it/x9johq82y5xf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fabdc447408e2da669f9027c6b5bcde0d042100e) But what this sequence does, as misplaced as it feels, is finally make Situ Ling see that Ming Yi has never given him a second thought and serve as a catalyst for Situ Ling’s transformation into the final boss. As a last ditch effort to salvage something that was never there, Situ Ling comes to see Ming Yi. He starts by asking Ming Yi if she remembers that she owes him for saving her life. But when she backs away from him even as he takes a step forward, he changes his mind asking about her for repayment. She tells him that they are just friends, and he leaves. And promptly answers Venom’s…uh…the blood ring’s call to the dark side. https://preview.redd.it/65yfz6yzx5xf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0aa3484682981705fbdc90107c64f9f5bb63868 So now Situ Ling’s villainization is complete. While Ming Yi was out earlier, Fuyue snuck into her room and made a copy of the Golden Millet Dream recipe. It turns out that Situ Ling’s father is in possession of some diwu tree core, which means Situ Ling will be able to gain all the power he needs to take control of the six realms and more importantly, the woman he covets. https://preview.redd.it/ax6nnd6yx5xf1.jpg?width=1626&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40b534cdd379fad4eddcff9c7d92e1e82586cc8a # Bozai and Ming Yi makes up It’s finally time for Ming Yi to make her long-awaited return to Yaoguan Mountain. As part of the Jixing Abyss entourage, Ming Yi is able to view the place she grew up with an objective lens for the first time and realize the unjustness of the system. She realizes that while her victories made Yaoguan Mountain richer, there are whole other realms out there getting poorer and poorer. I wonder if she is going to do anything about it. It was a heart-warming moment watching the Jixing team offer to help the warriors from the lower realm finish their chores. [“The six realms should help each other.”](https://preview.redd.it/vhvcvievx5xf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2ec6d42004b4c66fc92ab26138037e515c123e4) But my heart really leapt during the next scene, when a heart-to-heart leads Bozai to Ming Yi lamenting that Bozai has had it rough. But it doesn’t matter, he says, because he has his master, Granny Xun, Buxiu, and now her. And she didn’t contradict him when he said that he has her to love him. [It’s another stark contrast between a hero and a hero wannabe. The former doesn’t let his past embittered or define him. He counts the blessings he does have. The latter uses his past as justification for his misdeeds. ](https://preview.redd.it/hl42cskpo5xf1.jpg?width=1632&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4013cf14dae8e11f8176401c9e1762c376a5b54) And then it leaps yet again when Bozai restores their heart imprint. Thank god we can finally put the fake breakup behind us. And Buxiu can finally rest easy that Bozai didn’t splurge on a betrothal gift for nothing. [I loved how playful they got and Ming Yi giggled like a little girl. ](https://preview.redd.it/ituobm5up5xf1.jpg?width=2431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd4b2ee31337c4921bff30c2a5e857af799bb86b) # The unholy alliance Speaking of Buxiu. Ming Yi asks him to compete in the traveler’s competition in order to win the black mushroom. And the dragon proceeds to beat 725 opponents. I think it’s fitting that Buxiu be the one to win the ingredient crucial to resurrecting his friend. But when he reaches for the mushroom, Ming Xin arrives to take it from him. But it’s all a ploy to lure Ming Yi away so he can capture her, because Ming Xin has agreed to help deliver Ming Yi to Situ Ling. In return, Situ Ling gives him a small injection of spiritual energy with the promise of more in the future. So stupid, arrogant Ming Xin thinks he’s got Ming Yi dead to rights (I wanted to wipe that moronic smile off his face!), only to have her break free and overpower him. Ming Yi sees Ming Xin wielding Zhushui’s spiritual energy and thinks that he’s in cahoots with the Zhushui emperor. I wonder if Situ Ling is going to show up and finally reveal his true colors to Ming Yi. https://preview.redd.it/5fj8nwsur5xf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64e42806d2493fc8d72bf8a0078c8913b371b619 # Other notable moments / observations When Buxiu tells Bozai that Ming Yi has been taken by Ming Xin, instead of rushing to her rescue, Bozai calmly stays seated.

I don’t really see a point to this exercise. Is it just so the stronger warriors can intimidate the weaker ones?

Zhang Tai has decided to leave Moonlit Blossom. It’s a good thing that she actually has business acumen and can sell hairpins for a living. While hawking her wares with Ming Yi, Tianji shows up. After some slight, initial awkwardness, the women softens toward each other, with Tianji buying out all of Zhang Tai’s hairpins and Ming Yi putting a hairpin in Tianji’s hair. In a world that is not kind to women, it’s nice to see these women forget their differences and bond over a mutual love of hair accessories. [Tianji may be frustrating at times, but she’s not a bad sort. She just needs a friend. ](https://preview.redd.it/lxqdse2wx4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9218d5c6fade717644bed96bf904d8582b1a98c3) And how sweet it is of Zhang Tai and Ming Yi to go weep Xinliu’s tomb even though they have never met. Their good deeds are rewarded when Ming Yi comes across a scroll that Xinliu left, detailing Lord Hanfeng’s various crimes. The scroll mostly lists things we already know - like Hanfeng raising a netherbeast and confining innocent people in the Sunken Abyss to refine Heavenly Grief - but the fact that these atrocities are done with the involvement of people from the upper three realms is interesting. Ming Yi promptly hands the scroll over to Bozai, but not before removing the bits about the people of the three realms being involved. It’s yet another lie built upon the web of lies she already wove. I understand why she did. But it just adds the potential for more misunderstanding in the future.…&lt;sigh&gt;… https://preview.redd.it/qugly4w1y4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98120eb2e7dc9ff61670bb23f94e7f0cc2d44443 ❤️The way to a woman’s heart… Is to take her shopping. Ming Yi thinks Bozai’s feeling guilty because he’s using their marriage for his own purpose, but I think he just wants to make her happy after being encouraged by Nanny Xun to let Ming Yi share his life (bless that woman…) [It never occurs to Bozai to help her carry her purchases…](https://preview.redd.it/ykz7rm26y4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=339ab30372b3177c1f17f96c67d0dac814cd2011) Ming Yi being Ming Yi, she’s not above using his goodwill to coax him into producing some useful magical artifacts for her. His indulgent smiles tells me he knows what she’s doing, but he lets her get away with it. In one of the beginning sequences Ming Xian lamented that no one knows her. I think Bozai does even if he doesn’t know her real identity. I just hope he remembers this when shit hits the fan. [Scallion pancake shield? Is it edible? ](https://preview.redd.it/3o2peyyqz4vf1.jpg?width=1622&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0dcfe372fb57a756be87c26205cb9f1b799cfcb) He then says that if she’s willing, their wedding can become reality. He looks at her expectantly. She looks like she has no idea what he’s talking about. So he flees the scene of the crime by making an excuse about having some important to attend to. https://preview.redd.it/am1gnfyoz4vf1.jpg?width=1628&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfbe1bb8dc786ab71cba4d54bf1bb46fec3447ca ❤️Master and disciple I found Ming Yi’s interaction with She Tianlin numerous and heartwarming. Did she really have no idea what he’s talking knows her real gender? They reason that if people from the upper three realms are in cahoots with Lord Hanfeng, then the person who poisoned Ming Xian may very well be someone from Yaoguan Mountain. So off he goes back to investigate. But not before worrying that Ming Xian may really be falling for Bozai. Here is one person who really seems to care about Ming Xian, even if her own father is starting to doubt her loyalty. https://preview.redd.it/l71ub81jz4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2179e312d1a9f03f1d00eecd10ea83f908c15144 # We are in the same boat now… And that brings us all to the moment we’ve been waiting for. Ming Xian’s secret is revealed when 27 braves the Sunken Abyss to look for the list of people in cahoots with Lord Hanfeng and gets captured. Hen then runs back to Wugui Sea and inadvertently leads Lord Hanfeng and his minions back to Ming Yi. Oh, Er Shie Qi. We love you but that was a stupid thing to do. https://preview.redd.it/jjdhqafgz4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ffc0440801247e5f7993e3a02bd997b9ba38742 Upon hearing the news, various interested parties descend upon Wugui Sea to defend Ming Yi and Bozai, who is now being accused of consorting with the enemy. Ji Bozai: The search mirror can easily be controlled. Yes. I admit it. I am a traitor. Because Ming Xian begged me to let him lose. So he can pretend to be a woman and marry me. (Hum…it does sound ridiculous the way he puts it.) Situ Ling: The search mirror belongs to Yaoguan Mountain. So how did Lord Hanfeng get his hands on it? If Bozai is working with Yaoguan Mountain, why is Lord Hanfeng the one with an artifact from Yaoguan? Tianji: Ming Yi can’t be Ming Xian. Why don’t we let them do the heart imprint on the Marriage Stone? Um…for a a second, I actually can’t tell if Tianji meant to be helpful. Or if she’s trying to catch Ming Yi in her lie. I think it’s the former though. Bozai also pets Ming Yi’s hand in reassurance, which gives me hope. He surely knows who he is by now, but he understands and forgives her, right? https://preview.redd.it/1tge2lfdz4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4af98dce87210e8899bc15c7e1fe4a67646b7635 Not so fast. Because Bozai then says that he’s paying her back for what he owes. Stop giving mixed signals Bozai! Also, all of these people seem to still think that Ming Xian is a man disguised as a woman, not the other way around. Wait until they find out that they’ve all been fooled by a mere woman… So off to the Marriage Stone they go. ❤️Obstacle #1: The love bridge will only connect for real lovers. https://preview.redd.it/l3xfe1b9z4vf1.jpg?width=1617&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3be714a6a8e72a7d0d2f6deff5f95a2c97febaa7 I think my question got answered by the fact that they are able to penetrate the Mengyuan Pond, because only true lovers can cross it. Mengyuan 盟鴛 means “Promised Couple”. All the others who arrive after Ming Yi and Bozai, including an unhappy Situ Ling, are kept outside of the barrier. [“How can it be?” ](https://preview.redd.it/fi6jufq3z4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c2ec79b0936a6f31d23d8bb108f60fdd27e0d2c) ❤️Obstacle #2: Carving their names on the Marriage Stone This one turns out to be a doozy. Because if their love is fake, they will undergo divine punishment. The lighter punishment will see their primordial spirits damaged. The harsher punishment will have their souls scattered to the four winds. Despite the risk, Bozai proceeds with carving their names (his real names and Ming Yi’s fake one) on the stone anyway. Because what choice does he have? They are in the same boat now and Ming Yi can finally get what she wants. This is the first inkling we have about how tightly Bozai is controlling his emotions right now. For the first time since he got out of the Sunken Abyss, he trusts someone. But she turns out to be only playing him for a fool. As Bozai tries to carve Ming Yi’s name on the stone, he gets struck by lightning again and again. As he falls, a bottle of radiant spirit falls and breaks. So he did listen to Granny Yun and make a wish to the stars and harvest the radiant spirits in the hopes of having a real marriage with Ming Yi. https://preview.redd.it/8qzzj0d1z4vf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e07d9e9fe04497aadc4489e052164f8d9e242951 Finally, the Marriage Stone got tired of him and decides to let him carve Ming Yi’s fake name. Huh? Or is this a case of his true love softening the marriage stone’s stone-cold heart? Either way, a red thread now appears to bound them together. They are well and truly wed now. https://preview.redd.it/7kktof4zy4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14c0975c5b7a9d3b28295c07ba875da076b0b295 Hum…But what this also means is that Ming Yi’s original plan of getting Bozai to carve their names on the Marriage Stone was SHITE. But at least we can put all the lies behind us and star ane… Hold my beer. Says the writers. # I can’t tell him the truth just yet… Bozai’s primordial spirit is obviously damaged from his bout against the marriage stone. So Ming Yi tries to heal his wounds and revealed that she has spiritual veins. “Who are you really?” Ji Bozai asks. Wait…what? I thought that was obvious? I guess not. Because that’s when Ming Yi starts spouting off more lies about her being Ming Xian’s fiancée and how she’s here to find out who in Yaoguan Mountain is working with Hanfeng and how close she is to Ming Xian which is why she can command his animal companion and…excuse me while I go find a huge rock I can use to hit her on her huge, stupid, useless, and constipated noggin. Seriously, this woman has the EQ of a gnat. Can’t she see that she’s only twisting the knife, and that now is not the time to appeal to his reasons but his emotions? Granted, she’s probably going to end up in the slammer either way but talking about how he needs to keep her around to help him get to the bottom of Hanfeng’s perfidy is NOT the way to go. But maybe it’s because she knows that he’s fallen for her, and doesn’t want to further exploit him? Either way, I feel like channeling Tony Leung during the last scene of In the Mood for Love. https://preview.redd.it/io360riey4vf1.jpg?width=1513&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d54e39f0f20ca84c5b024bf45d190cc7f2c546c1 And Ji Bozai is not buying it anyway. He knows she’s still lying to him. And he’ll keep her locked up until she is ready to tell him the truth. # A Truce, of sorts. Except Princess Tianji wants to see them, so Bozai had to let Ming Yi out to keep up appearances. The two then reaches a detente, of sorts, after Ming Yi pledges to help Bozai refine the netherbeast by using her own body as the refining vessel. https://preview.redd.it/20m2zqn9y4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c2a69638451139a37e5fe631ce680022c66671c Bozai doesn’t take her up on the offer, but does agree to work with her. On three conditions. 1. Ming Yi cannot contact anyone from another realm. (Hum..methinks what he really wants is to prevent her from contacting Min Xian. He is jealous of her alter ego.) 2. Ming Yi has to come running whenever he summons her. 3. She just need to tell him how to refine netherbeasts. She doesn’t have to worry about anything else. So the two are now working together but not completely trusting each other and not quite a couple. Honestly. I feel like I’ve seen this script before. # 調虎離山 (Luring tiger away from the mountain) It’s time to train for the next Qingyun tournament. To keep an eye on Bozai, Hanfeng’s laptop Sun Liao suggests that the five warriors all move into Wuguai Sea. As a compromise, Tianji suggests that they all move into Shuohua Academy. Unlike the others, Bozai’s married status means that he gets to bring Ming Yi and have his own room. This allows the two to stage a fake fight. [\\\\""A leak cannot be repaired. Broken is broken. We can\'t go back to before.\\\\"" Um...this fake fight sounds all too real to me. ](https://preview.redd.it/t5u49igep4vf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=956d9a2d6d6cc732a2940d713d776768bcf833d9) Bozai pretends to be kicked out, goes to the Moonlit Blossom, proceeds to get roaring drunk, and asks Lord Hanfeng to visit him. I am assuming this is lure Hanfeng away so Ming Yi can pay a visit to the Dragon Carp Terrace. Regardless if this ploy works, I really enjoyed watching Hou Ming Hao ham it up as the drunk, aggrieved husband. https://preview.redd.it/mkivuqz6q4vf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb4864e013573f71605be17b2c2b48c16f327942 # Checking in on our other long suffering characters In the entire realm of Jixing Abyss, there is not one happy camper to be found. ❤️Tianji and Yan Xiao continue to do their song and dance, except this time it looks like Tianji is seriously considering cutting her losses. Yan Xiao‘s latest act of betrayal - leading guards to arrest Bozai in the one place that Tianji still has some control over - really cut her to the quick. [As usual, Quan Yi Lun’s micro-expressions stole the show for me. ](https://preview.redd.it/nnier54tr4vf1.jpg?width=2457&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5af7a04ce8692ae24966f796e1b46da02e778e) I really need to find out what Yan Xiao’s game plan is. Is he really an opportunist looking to advance, or is he trying to protect Tianji like some of you have speculated? ❤️Situ Ling has one dream - to grow some spiritual veins and become a warrior like Ming Xian. But when push comes to shove, he is willing to give up his dreams to save Ming Xian. Unlike Tianji and Yan Xiao, whose fates are no means certain but at least it’s not completely hopeless, I think it’s safe to say that Situ Ling has no chance against the misfortune of having been cast as cannon fodder. It’s not your fault Ling Ling. You are just not the ML. [“Their wedding must be fake. There can’t be anything real between them”. I am sorry Ling Ling.

Dhadak 2 (2025) is made as a bold sequel to the 2018 movie Dhadak, which itself was a remake of the Marathi hit Sairat. This time, director Shazia Iqbal remakes another powerful film, Mari Selvaraj’s Tamil masterpiece *Pariyerum Perumal*. But instead of keeping its power and honesty, Dhadak 2 turns it into a soft and polished Bollywood drama. The film looks beautiful from outside but feels empty from inside. The story is about Neelesh Ahirwar (Siddhant Chaturvedi), a Dalit law student who gets admission in a top university through reservation. There, he meets Vidhi Bhardwaj (Triptii Dimri), a rich Brahmin girl. Their friendship turns into love, but society and Vidhi’s family refuse to accept their relationship because of caste. Neelesh faces insults, humiliation, and violence but slowly learns to fight back. The film tries to show caste realities mixed with a love story, but it fails badly in almost every way. The biggest problem with Dhadak 2 is that it copies *Pariyerum Perumal* without understanding its heart. The Tamil film felt real and raw because it was based on true social realities. Dhadak 2, on the other hand, replaces that rawness with glossy sets, slow-motion shots, romantic songs, and pretty visuals. The result is a story that looks fake and distant. Bollywood again does what it often does polishing pain to make it look pretty. Songs like “Duniya Alag” and “Bas Ek Dhadak” sound emotional but take away the seriousness of caste violence. The film turns real suffering into something decorative. In *Pariyerum Perumal*, caste is the main subject and love is a way to show that injustice. In Dhadak 2, love is the main story and caste is treated as a small problem. That is the main difference, and the reason why this remake feels shallow. The movie begins with a shocking scene a Dalit boy is killed by a contract killer. It sets a serious tone. But the very next scene, where Neelesh and Vidhi meet, feels like an old-fashioned Bollywood romance polished and overacted. This jump completely breaks the mood. As the story goes on, we keep seeing Neelesh getting bullied, insulted, and beaten. These scenes are supposed to make us feel his pain, but they are repeated so many times that the audience stops feeling sympathy. The film uses his suffering again and again but without purpose. One of the few real moments in the movie comes when Neelesh is arrested and his mother is slapped by the police. That short scene feels honest and real. But apart from this, most of the movie feels fake and forced. There is also a strange part where the college principal is shown as a Muslim man. This choice feels wrong because in real life, most institutions are run by upper-caste people. It shows that the director has not done enough research. Siddhant Chaturvedi tries hard as Neelesh. But his change from a shy boy to a confident man does not look natural because of poor writing. Triptii Dimri looks elegant as Vidhi, but her performance feels empty and lacks emotion. Their love story looks good on screen but does not touch the heart. Good actors like Harish Khanna, Zakir Hussain, and Saurabh Sachdeva are completely wasted. Their characters are flat and simple, even though they could have shown how caste works in higher education spaces. The only performance that feels true is by Vipin Sharma as Neelesh’s father. His small role feels powerful and real. Other than him, there are no moments that stay in the mind. Once the movie ends, nothing remains to think about. The writing is the weakest part of Dhadak 2. The dialogues are dull and often sound childish. The movie drags, especially in the second half. The editing is rough and the scenes do not connect well. Director Shazia Iqbal seems to want to mix social message with romance, but she fails to do justice to either. Sometimes the movie feels like a love story, sometimes like a social film. This confusion runs throughout. Visually, the film looks very good. The lighting, camera work, and costumes are all perfect. But that becomes a problem too because the beauty of the visuals clashes with the dark subject of caste. The film ends up looking too clean to be believable. Seen from an Ambedkarite point of view, Dhadak 2 feels shallow and commercial. It uses Dalit pain as decoration, not as lived experience. Ambedkar taught that caste is not just discrimination it is a complete system that controls life, love, and education. The Tamil original understood this truth deeply. Dhadak 2 only copies its surface. Neelesh’s character is shown as helpless for too long. His political awakening, his self-respect, and his awareness as a Dalit man are missing. True Ambedkarite cinema should not only show suffering but also strength and resistance. Dhadak 2 fails to do that. Bollywood again takes a story of the oppressed and turns it into something safe and sellable. It wants to look socially aware without being truly political. It avoids questioning upper-caste privilege and guilt. In trying to be both brave and commercial, it becomes neither. Dhadak 2 could have been a strong film about love and caste, a movie that carried Ambedkar’s message of equality and justice. But it ends up as a glossy, confused Bollywood drama pretending to be serious. The only good thing is that it brings the topic of caste into mainstream discussion. Bollywood has mostly ignored caste, so even this attempt is a small step forward. Maybe some young viewers will think about caste for the first time after watching it. But as a movie, it is weak, confused, and emotionally fake. For people who have seen *Pariyerum Perumal*, Dhadak 2 will feel like a poor imitation. For others, it may offer a few emotional moments, but nothing lasting. It lacks the courage, anger, and honesty that true Ambedkarite cinema needs. In short, Dhadak 2 is a beautiful mirror but with no reflection. **Rating: 1/5**', 'Downfall of Dharma. **TLDR: VERY LONG post but I am just telling KJO to work on the story and then make a film. The story decides everything. Do not make a movie based on the actors and formulate the story about it. First find a good story with actual writers, and then find actors that fit that role** Hey everyone, last week I made a post about how the untalented actresses are getting several opportunities which are ruining some decent films. So I decided to rewatch some Bollywood movies that I used to watch as I grew up and I just don\'t understand what happened to Dharma. Like they just lost all there charm in their movies. And I noticed that there were 3 categories they used to make their films in and how now barely any of them fit. So here goes, this might be kind of long but if you get a chance to read this I would appreciate it. (note: This is about the films they produced not distributed/presented) 1) Classics- So these are obviously the big ones right like KKHH, K3G, KHNH, KANK, etc. (So many K\'s LOL) But these are the ones that are universally loved. Are they melodramatic, over the top, and stereotypical? Sure but despite those flaws these films are critically acclaimed and have a cult status because they actually had actors who gave their 100%, a director who cared, and a proper story. Like even a movie with a lot of flaws like Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna, it had unnecessary subplots with making Big B a playboy and whatever and then 2 seconds later you have Abhishek acting his butt off and SRK being extremely convincing as a jerk, a cool twist on his typical lover boy. 2) Modern- So this is like towards 2007, when Bollywood hit a new experimental area. Movies like Luck By Chance, Taare Zameen Par would come out at the same time as Om Shanti Om and Welcome. So of course Dharma joined in as well, and actually made some decent movies. Wake Up Sid, YJHD, Dulhania series, 2 States, Dostana, etc. And these movies were also pretty good let\'s be honest. Yeah the new batch had some over the top and some acting they needed to work on but the music album would be a blast or the story would be interesting or the acting performances would just be off the charts. Like I mean in one year they released Wake Up Sid/Ek Main Aur Ek Tu and Dostana, both modern takes on newer generation problems (coming of age story and finding your own place/typical love triangle). But still they were churning out these fun stories. 3) Risks- Now I know a lot of people say Dharma is just romantic movies SRK-Kajol pair but tbh they did take a lot of risks. I mean releasing My Name is Khan was just an extremely risky move as we all know and even making a movie like Kurbaan. They would release a We Are Family, a sad family drama, and then a rom com with 2 new actors like I Hate Luv Stories. Or then they would remake a big flop and made it a blockbuster like Agneepath and in the same year release SOTY. I mean look at 2016. We had Kapoor and Sons, a somber family drama which was excellent with amazing performances and an actual proper take on difficulties in family life, sexualities, and love. Then a pretty forgetful Baar Baar Dekho but at least it had a decent music album. Then we would have the terrible ADHM (hot take, I just hate this movie don\'t get me started, music is great tho) but people loved it. And then an actual slice of life coming of age movie like Dear Zindagi. So there was a lot of variety So what changed? Was it the constant remakes, the launching of more and more untalented actors, or have they lost their touch? Honestly, I do not think Karan has lost his touch. I mean look at 2017 beyond right, in my opinion the only good films that were produced were: Badri Ki Dulhania, Ittefaq, Raazi, Simmba, Kesari, Good Newwz, Shershaah, Sooryavanshi, Gehraiyaan, JugJug Jeeyo, Bhramastra, Rocky Rani, and Kill. They have produced 32 films since 2017 and this is only 13. And even some of these are whatever. The problem is all those movies look the same. The production design for Good Newwz, JugJug Jeeyo, Rocky Rani, and now Sunny Sanskari look they are all the same. Bhramastra was an interesting risk, pretty bad script we all know, but it was still something fresh and new like Kill and honestly Rocky Rani. It feels like these days it\'s a check mark. Like is there a song with a hook step that will go viral on insta reels (What Jhumka, Naach Punjabaan, Toba Toba, Panwaadi, every song from Govinda Naam Mera and Selfiee) or is it a popular story that we can remake or lets bring a famous South actor and just stuff them in the film, not make an actual film that showcases their skills (Devara, Dhadak 1, Selfiee, Dhadak 2, Liger). Or it is just a film made to launch the new nepokid OR a film with a nepokid in a different role to show they have ""variety in their acting"", and no just because you made Kill does not mean anything (Ae Watan Mere Watan, Naadaniyan, Student of the Year 2, Dhadak, Gajat Saxena, Liger, Mr. and Mrs. Mahi, Sarzameen) The only one where I feel like a flop movie that Dharma tried on and it unfortunately did not work were Brothers and Kalank. I thought Brothers, even though it was a remake, it actually was good and had amazing performances. Or the thing with Kalank was like production design was great, performances, dances were good but they just needed to work on the story. **AND THIS IS MY MAIN POINT!** Dharma used to care about the story of the film and that is what makes the movie. But now it is like, ""Oh let\'s get this popular actor, add a reel, put the same set from a different movie, sell OTT rights for the budget and release it, if it goes well good PR for the actors and if it is bad we will have director go do an apology"". Like no this won\'t cut it anymore. And this is the same as Maddock (whole other story but basic gist is that it feels like the horror comedy is like let\'s add some insta jokes, dance item song, and tease at the end). But please KJO if you are listening, just stop wasting your time with giving these actors and actresses who have had 10-15 movies and have not improved any more chances. Please come back to the director chair and make an actual film not a reactionary one. Yes Rocky Rani was good, but it sounded like a response to every little critique and felt more as a PSA than an actual film. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was ruined with a terrible cancer subplot and a somewhat cringe first half, you had an actual film that you could have made with the one-sided love but it was just ruined. Please make something you are passionate about and a story you truly want to tell. Don\'t make it like a check box.', 'People keep hating Abhimanyu Birla for one “White Day,” but forget everything that led up to it.. Okay so I’m someone who honestly doesn’t watch daily soaps anymore. Whenever my mom put on *YRKKH 4gen*, I’d usually just leave the room especially during the recent mess and have constantly begged her not to watch this crap. But being a Harshad Chopda fan, I binge-watched the AbhiRa era recently, and honestly, I can’t understand the hate Abhimanyu gets. So here’s my take not as a blind fan, but as someone who looked at his entire journey from start to finish. **The “White Day” wasn’t born in a day** People hate him for asking Akshara for divorce after Neil’s death and her miscarriage and yes, it was harsh, painful, and wrong. But it’s like hitting a wall with a hammer every day ,one day it will collapse. That’s what happened with Abhi. He was crumbling long before that day. I’m not saying Abhi was perfect…. far from it. He was flawed, impulsive, emotional, sometimes even extreme. But so was everyone else around him. And unlike most, he owned up to his mistakes, carried guilt, and still tried to make things right later. So yeah, hate him for his mistakes if you must but don’t erase the emotional trauma and constant pressure that built up to them. He wasn’t a monster; he was a man pushed past his breaking point. **From the beginning his love wasn’t shallow** When Abhimanyu first met Akshara, he was mesmerized by her voice. It wasn’t a random crush “love at first sight” only … their connection grew through moments of kindness, empathy, and mutual respect the time they spent during the event and resort . And when he gets to know the girl he’s been going Gaga about is the same girl his family wants him to marry it becomes an actual thing automatically… Then came the twist his family wanted him to marry *her sister*. He rejected that alliance immediately, confessed his love for Akshu in front of everyone, while she stayed silent and later rejected him herself. Even then, his family forced him toward Arohi. Imagine hearing all that humiliation, standing your ground for love, and still being asked to marry the other sister it’s absurd. Even then, Abhi tells Arohi clearly that there won’t be love in this marriage. She accepts, and the family manipulates things further feeding him false narratives about Arohi’s goodness and Akshu’s silence. People often say *“Abhimanyu manipulated his way into a confession.”* But honestly, I saw it more as him putting his heart out there exposing himself emotionally just to see how much Akshu would let him suffer in that false pretence. **Manipulation and misunderstandings** Arohi *knew* about the phone and message confusion but kept quiet. Akshu saved Abhi from the fire, but he was made to believe she *left him to die*. Think about how Abhi would have felt that point that all his feelings were in his head , she didn’t even care about him this much it’s almost like going through a breakup . When Akshu did pooja for Manjari, Arohi took the credit. Anyone in his place would start doubting reality. It’s psychological manipulation, not just “family drama.” Then came his mother’s accident Akshu *again* hid the truth thinking she was protecting peace. But silence and half-truths always made things worse. And for those who say *“he was too rude to Arohi”* try to see it from his perspective. He only knew her through her manipulative, unethical actions and the constant trouble she created for others. Any sane person would be wary of someone like that.Sure, a lot of Arohi’s behavior stems from her upbringing and family dynamics but how is that Abhi’s fault? He wasn’t judging her past; he was reacting to her present behavior. People forget Arohi was shown as an over ambitious doctor who flaunted her achievements. She topped her MBBS batch, sure but Abhimanyu holds the record for *state topper* and is a *specialist surgeon*. Yet he never boasted, never competed, never looked down on her.Meanwhile, she always acted superior to him like she had to prove something. The wedding day confession is actually a bad thing happening to any girl but until this point her character was shown very manipulative calculated so i felt happier for Abhira than sad for Arohi ( cos her feelings were not hurt more like ego crashing )even then she did Ego monologue. **The wedding and the cycle repeating** When Abhi and Akshu’s wedding finally happened, Abhi ended up doing the same thing Arohi once did blaming every little thing on Akshu, suspecting her motives. Was it fair? No. But after all the manipulation and silence he had endured, his vigilance was natural. Because at the end of the day, Akshu always turned a blind eye to Arohi’s actions. And that left Abhi constantly fighting battles alone for truth, for loyalty, for love **The emotional weight no one talks about** On top of all this, imagine realizing the woman you love carries guilt for her mother’s death since childhood. She has panic attacks, emotional trauma, and has been forced to carry all of that alone because her family never helped her heal. For Abhimanyu, who himself grew up watching his mother suffer, it must’ve been unbearable to see Akshara living with that kind of pain. **After marriage his fears came true** When Akshu married Abhi, she actually walked into a loving family Manjari adored her, Neil treated her like his own, even Parth and Shefali were warm. The only real issue was Harshvardhan Abhi had told Akshu clearly that the family dynamics in the Birla house weren’t like Goenkas. His biggest fear was seeing Akshu suffer the way his mother had ,quietly, endlessly, emotionally crushed. He wanted Akshu to prioritize *them* ,their relationship over unnecessary involvement in family politics. That wasn’t control; it was fear. He even asked her for one promise: not to get caught up in these dynamics and to focus on building their bond. Which, considering his past, was a very logical and emotionally honest request. **The anniversary incident the most misunderstood moment** Abhi specifically asked her not to celebrate their anniversary. Everyone told her not to, even if they didn’t explain the full reason but she still went ahead. For Akshu, it was innocent but for Abhi, it was traumatic. As a child, he’d watched his father humiliate his mother during such “celebrations.” Seeing his mother cry over something as simple as cake cutting left a permanent scar. So when Akshu forced that memory back into his life, all those emotions came flooding back. And still, he didn’t lash out violently just reacted out of shock and suppressed pain. **The music therapy department gift** To make her happy, he built an entire *music therapy department* for her at the hospital a huge gesture of love and respect for her talent. And what did he get in return? In front of everyone, she belittled it because of something his father said — a man Abhi *hated* and had openly opposed. Instead of talking privately, she publicly rejected the gift. Her intention might’ve been right, but the delivery was cruel. He had poured love, effort, and respect into that gesture and she crushed it. Even after that, he kept trying to cheer her up, plan things, and make her smile. **The Harshvardhan Neil revelation** Then came one of the most painful moments the revelation that Neil was actually Harshvardhan’s son from an extra-marital affair. It shattered the whole family, and Abhi, who had always despised his father’s behavior, felt betrayed and disgusted. It shook his entire sense of identity and faith in family. But through it all, he still tried to hold himself together for his mother, for Akshu, for the peace of the house. **When things finally started getting better…** It’s not like Akshu “hid” problems, but she never really tried to *solve* them either. Abhi was the one constantly taking steps, trying to fix situations. Their ways of handling issues were completely different he was direct, she avoided. Abhi was always the mature one like the way he handled his sister and Kairav’s situation. The moment he realized Akshu was uncomfortable, he came clean, admitted the truth, and dealt with it respectfully. Then, when his sister attempted suicide, everyone turned on Kairav. Akshu defended him, which is natural but since she *always* defended Arohi earlier, it was hard for Abhi to blindly trust her version this time. And then, when an eyewitness came forward saying he saw Kairav *pushing* his sister, any logical person would doubt. Still, Abhi respected Akshu’s feelings and agreed to give Kairav a chance to explain himself. But then Kairav *fled*. **The hand surgery peak stupidity and emotional chaos** This was honestly one of the most frustrating parts Akshu’s handling of Abhi’s hand injury. You have your *own hospital*. If you think a doctor’s intentions are wrong, you inform the board, you raise a complaint you don’t stay silent while he performs the surgery! Even after the surgery, she could’ve refused to go with that unethical doctor. There was no proof nothing forcing her to comply. Yes, vows and promises matter, but when the other person’s intentions are evil, ethics come first. You don’t quietly leave your husband mid-recovery and vanish. But that’s what she did she picked up her stuff and disappeared, without a word, without a reason. And then she spends *a whole year* thinking about him, missing him, romanticizing her “sacrifice” in endless monologue she gave after one year about how she “did the right thing alone.” Meanwhile, Abhi recovering from surgery, emotionally wrecked, surrounded by people who always opposed their marriage has no idea where his wife is or *why* she left. What kind of thoughts would that man be living with? Anxiety, guilt, heartbreak all tangled together. Even after all that, when he finally hears her voice and meets her again, she says *“Wait for 24 hours.”* Like seriously? You vanish for a year and then say that? Of course he lost his calm. Anyone would. He’s not some monk or Gandhi. Still, they somehow cleared their misunderstandings later, and the ever-mahaan Akshara was back in Abhi’s life. **Arohi-Neil chaotic shadi and Pregnancy** Then comes the Arohi and Neil wedding shit I honestly felt very bad for Abhi. The way Arohi kept poisoning that pure, good-hearted, cheerful soul Neil and created distance between Abhi and Neil I genuinely felt bad. Matlab itne ache Ram Lakshman jese bhai ke beech Surpankha Arohi. Khair, that plot was whatever they wanted to put for drama so I don’t have much to say there. Uske baad the baby wala thingy Arohi was pure evil. Abhi khud sad tha ki he won’t have babies. It wasn’t just Akshu ka sapna; it was his too. But he still tried to be strong and even started looking up treatment options not for himself, but so he could give Akshu some hope and tell her that maybe things can get better, that there’s still a chance. That’s how much he cared. But meanwhile, Arohi was being her usual manipulative self using unfair means, trying to create misunderstandings between Abhi and Akshu. And yes, maybe at that time Abhi could’ve told Akshu something like, “There might be complications, but I’m talking to specialists let’s not lose hope yet.” Not to hide it, but to handle it better. Phir Arohi ka fake pregnancy drama Akshu literally told her to tell the truth. Matlab ek baar galti sabse hoti hai, har baar galti repeat karna bewakoofi hoti hai. Then when Akshu got pregnant, things were going well between them. Abhi was just being a little extra caring haan tone down ho sakta tha thoda but it was honestly cute and nice to watch. **White day** Then imagine, he goes out for just one day and sab ujhad gaya. Matlab aisa koi promise nahi maangta ki “room se bahar mat nikalna” unless there’s something serious, and Abhi knew Akshu has a tendency to land in trouble girti, chot khati, phir kuch na kuch hota hai. She had stomach pain, okay fine go to the doctor, come back. But then she got involved in some trafficking mess, saw girls in trouble and instead of waiting for police , she went to fight them herself. Even police officers don’t go fight without backup, so how can she? That was plain stupidity.She could have followed that truck till police came Phir jo hona tha ho gaya. When Abhi came to the hospital, he was panicking, looking for Akshu everywhere scared out of his mind. And then Akshu said, “I couldn’t save my kids.” Matlab you’re literally feeding that guilt into him. Obviously his mind would break hearing that. Neil died. Now, of course Akshu didn’t *kill* him, but the circumstances all started because of her impulsiveness. Because of that, Neil died, and with him the two unborn kids of the family. **Not holding her responsible but emotions grief Apko logical reasoning nhi dete**. Neil’s mother and wife were heartbroken, and naturally angry at Akshu — and in that emotional mess, they didn’t want her around. Abhi, who had just lost his brother (who he practically raised like a son) and his unborn children, was also under immense emotional distress. His mother was shattered too. So when people say “he asked Akshu to leave,” they forget — at that time, everyone was in shock, and he was just trying to handle the chaos. It wasn’t about hate. And haan, grief doesn’t make you logical. When someone’s world falls apart like that, you can’t expect them to act all calm and sensible. Akshu saying “meri kya galti” at that point only made things worse it poked the wound deeper. So yes, Abhi reacted **extremely badly** but you can’t dump all the show’s blame on him. It was a chain of pain and misunderstanding, not a single person’s fault. Aur phir Akshu ghar chor ke chali gayi matlab why? She could’ve stayed at her family’s house, handled things better, even taken some time apart if needed. But instead she went off with a stranger lived with Abhinav. And her justification ki “she tried to tell Abhi about the baby” doesn’t hold because she never communicated it properly, and that’s her pattern hiding, running away, thinking she’s doing sacrifice but actually creating bigger messes. Abhi was also grieving he lost his brother, kids, trust, everything. So her vanishing like that only added to the pain. Aur ab agar log bolte hain ki “she left for self-respect,” to mujhe wo bilkul nahi lagta. It wasn’t self-respect, it was poor decision-making. You already had one miscarriage, it was a difficult pregnancy and instead of staying where you’d get support, you chose a difficult lonely life with a stranger? Kaha ki samajhdari thi ye. If she would have stayed at Goenka house and remained separated from Abhi I would have supported it fair and square . And Abhinav haan, he was a good man, kind-hearted, helpful, but people overrate him so much. He didn’t have the same emotional or family baggage like Abhi. He was just a simple man who always said yes to whatever Akshu said. That’s not love that’s compliance. Their relationship wasn’t real romance or partnership; it was mutual coexistence. And if he was truly that good and selfless, he should’ve told Abhi about Abhir even indirectly which he tried once and failed because of Akshara but he had ample time to think it through and try again. He was an orphan himself; he should’ve understood the pain of a father losing his child unknowingly. But of course, that wouldn’t serve the show’s drama so they kept it that way. And just like that, their story froze in pain one walked away to survive, and one stayed behind to suffer. **Cut to the leap** Abhi with Roohi was so heartwarming. The way he loved her was all hearts. And yes, Akshara’s life was also good in her own way. But then they cross paths and for Abhi, it’s tormenting. His whole life falls apart the moment he sees the love of his life moved on, has a husband and a baby the exact dream he had always wished for. He doesn’t create any drama. Even after knowing Abhinav’s truth, he stays nice to him. Tell me honestly, who behaves so gracefully with their ex’s current partner, especially when your story ended in such a painful way? His scenes with Abhir were pure gold so emotional, so raw and then when he apologised to Akshara for what he said about Sirat Maa, that hit deep. The guilt he had carried for years, he finally let it out, admitting he said it in emotional turmoil. And yes, Akshu reacted harshly, but okay she was heartbroken, and it brought back all her past trauma, panic, childhood pain. **And here I don’t blame Akshara this was really bad what Abhi did** and regretted his whole life. Then Abhinav realised that Abhir was Abhi’s son and all this while, he had thought Abhi was some bad, angry man. But after spending time with him, he saw what kind of person Abhi really was kind, good-hearted, caring. If he was truly that “achha aadmi” he claimed to be, he could’ve at least told Abhi the truth that this was his son. Even indirectly. Then came the emotional phase of Abhimanyu suffering silently, seeing his ex-wife move on. It was heartbreaking. Like genuinely, I used to tear up watching that. People say, “He divorced her, it’s been years, he should move on.” Sure, he *could’ve*, but love doesn’t work on timelines. His heart still beat for her, and seeing her happy elsewhere shattered him inside. Then the whole plot when Akshu came back into their lives in Udaipur of course it was difficult for everyone. That chapter was left at such a dark point; her return brought back everything. And then again, the same Arohi Abhimanyu wedding drama utter nonsense. Like how many times are we going to recycle this? If it was just for Roohi’s sake, they could’ve easily made him her legal guardian. Why the wedding again? Then the makers made Abhi cry every single day and it showed. You could literally see it on Harshad’s face, how mentally and physically drained the character and actor was. That entire post-revelation phase was painful to watch. And the way Akshu handled the Abhir revelation was also so poor. I get her fear that Abhi might take her son away, but that’s *his* child too the heartache was on both sides. And still, Abhi tried to keep both kids Roohi and Abhir together, lovingly, calmly. That’s such beautiful maturity where he handled Roohi’s insecurity and possessiveness about sharing and caring. When he stayed at their vacation home he didn’t cross any line. He loved his son, respected Akshu, and was nice to Abhinav. Tell me, which ex-husband behaves like that? He wasn’t just being polite; he was genuinely kind to Abhinav, not out of guilt that he raised his son but out of decency. And honestly, 6 years Akshu never truly loved Abhinav. Suddenly, because of the Abhi drama, she started forcing that love narrative, but I always felt Abhinav was wronged emotionally. She could never reciprocate what he felt. He got a family, yes, but it always felt one-sided. Abhi helping in everything from Muskaan’s wedding to supporting everyone just shows what a gem of a person he was. He accepted everything Akshu said about him, reflected, and *changed*. That’s real growth. They say true love is when you’re happy in someone else’s happiness that’s literally Abhimanyu. Akshu took away both his biggest dreams a happy loving couple and being the father he always wanted to be yet he never turned bitter. He could’ve been angry, vengeful, cruel even but he wasn’t. He handled everything with grace. Matlab seriously, who can hate Abhi after all this? Then came the confession he confessed his love again, only to be blamed and ridiculed for loving a “married woman.” But hello Akshara *knew* the truth about her so-called “marriage.” She herself said there was nothing between them and when she cried and ran after Abhi’s accident ? So why was Abhi villainised for expressing his emotions honestly? Every single time, he was struggling between his family, Akshara’s family, and Abhir’s well-being yet he was the one who got blamed, insulted, and emotionally drained. Then that birthday party he planned for Abhinav omg, who even does that? That’s how pure his heart was. That “achha aadmi” only did one acha thing towards Abhi that was share Abhir’s Bachpan ka pics.Honestly, that “achha aadmi” tag if anyone deserved it, it was Abhimanyu. What did he do wrong? Nothing except love too deeply, care too much. Even after everything, whenever someone disrespected Akshu in front of him, he would quietly take her side, defend her indirectly because he didn’t have that right anymore, yet his heart wouldn’t let him stay silent like that financial status part and Manjari shouting when Akshara and Abhinav got the matka for Pooja. After Abhinav’s death, Akshu could’ve behaved more maturely initially, considering she had seen what happened with Kairav. But at least she fought for Abhi later, which was commendable . When they were about to get married again, I was 100% pro it because if anyone ever truly loved someone, it was Abhi. Akshu’s decision ki “ab bacha n bola to shaadi karlo” felt so wrong. Even Arohi had a choice she could’ve done the same, but she didn’t. And I was honestly hoping that maybe, finally, the gift that was snatched from Abhi years ago of having a family, being a dad he could relive it again with Akshu and her new pregnancy. But no they had to ruin that too. **Arohi’s accident, the way they handled it, was ridiculous.** Like why make it such a trauma point for everyone? Roohi growing up thinking her masi killed her mom, Abhi dying with guilt what even was that? They could’ve easily just called it an accident, kept the family together, let everyone heal. Her decision destroyed life of 3 kids she took away their life with a happy big family by separating . Akshu went back into her “mahaan” mode, living a miserable life, dragging Abhira into pain the cycle repeating itself.And I’m pretty sure Abhi would have taken care of Roohi too if he wasnt dead but in those circumstances he couldn’t have left Akshara and Abhir . If I had a man like Abhimanyu in my life, I’d thank the gods every single day. I’m not saying he was perfect but most of their problems arose because of *how* Akshu handled things. If you don’t behave like Akshu, you’ll never even see Abhi’s bad side. You will get a man who loves you to the moon and back , respects you and will fight the world for you . And even if we consider that yes, he made mistakes at least he owned up, learned, and moved forward. His bond with Arohi, Roohi, Akshu, Abhir he fixed everything he could. He even stood up to his own mother in the end, supported Shefali, handled Shivu and Abhir’s fight so calmly he was great with all the kids and also as a doctor . Till his last breath, Abhi supported Akshara helped her with exam which she wanted to use against Abhi for custody, Muskaan’s wedding, Abhir’s custody even when he had no obligation to. And also, people should stop comparing Abhinav and Abhi ,taking care of a random woman’s child when you have no family of your own is not the same as a man accepting his ex-wife’s baby with another man and still treating that child as his own. That’s on another level altogether. *Abhimanyu’s life was a storm of grief, betrayal, guilt, and heartbreak. But through it all, he loved fiercely, selflessly, unconditionally. He carried pain silently, stood for justice quietly, and always chose compassion over anger. His strength wasn’t loud; it was quiet, steady, enduring.* *To watch him was to witness the purest form of love: flawed, human, yet transcendent. Every struggle, every tear, every small act of kindness ,that was Dr. Abhimanyu Birla. And if you ever had a man like that in your life, you’d value that true love*. **Just my opinion. Ik it’s lengthy but that’s how you understand because this is what shaped the character and without reading the entire thing pls don’t fight with me I’m not justifying his action .**']"

Trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTHs7EasvvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTHs7EasvvI) I'm new to short dramas (tried a few but got distracted/lost interest) but decided to watch this because [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nlqczl/the_maid_2025_is_the_best_short_drama_ive_watched/) praised it. It's SO GOOD! Seriously, if you like costume dramas with super melodramatic plot lines, improbable plot twists paired with good acting, gorgeous costumes (some of the dresses made me go 'huh, is that really accurate?', but I have next to zero knowledge of the historical accuracy and for this type of drama I don't care) and cinematography, decent and tightly written script (could teach a lot of the regular-length cdramas a thing or two) and a gripping story - then go watch this drama. First 8 episodes can be viewed for free on YT (maybe depending on your region): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9razKtFiipE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9razKtFiipE) I couldn't wait and went to WeTv for a subscription so I could binged the whole thing. **The premise:** Shen Yuqing (Zhao Xixi) is the mistreated concubine daughter of a powerful general's family, who's forced to take her legitimate sister's Shen Yuanjin (Yang Yunxuan) place on the wedding night to the scary and powerful regent prince Pei Ji (Deng Kai), since her sister has lost her virginity. Falling pregnant, the FL and her concubine mother escapes, but her mom is killed and her newborn child is stolen by her sister. After that Yuqing devotes herself completely to revenge on all those who harmed her. She takes on a new identity, trains as a courtesan and schemes her way into Pei Ji's mansion. Now her plot for revenge can begin... The plot is fast-moving and the script gives you just the right amount of information about the characters, with loads of reveals along the way that (for the most part) don't feel out of place. The story is melodramatic to an almost ridiculous degree, but to me it felt like watching The Double - there's real emotion at play and all the characters' actions and motivations make sense, while there were a few times were I laughed because of how over-the-top melodramatic and a bit silly it got (also my reaction to The Double) while still finding it highly entertaining and not actual stupid like in a lot of other cdramas (also some more 'serious' ones). E.g.&gt;! no parent in their right mind would throw a 3-year old out on the street for 'training/teaching him a bout real life'!&lt;. That made me laugh out loud, which I doubt was the drama's intention. **The actors:** The cast was such a treat. With some of the extras and a few side characters (like the Dowager Empress) I do think the lower budget of a short drama showed and some of their acting wasn't that good, but all the main actors seems to have been totally committed and gave it their all. The SFL and SML, the evil stepmother (Zhang Yingbing)- all did great (I even found myself moved by &gt;!the tragic love story of Shen Yuanjin and her lover, despite how absolutely evil she was!&lt;). Another highlight was Shen Yuanjin's cousin (Yao Nuo), who was great as the hot, sadistic drug addict &gt;!with hidden trauma!&lt; (and I'm was a bit shocked how&gt;! she was almost openly portrayed as a lesbian who's obsessively attracted to the FL!&lt; \\- maybe that's something you can get away with in a short drama?). Zhao Xixi was fantastic as the FL with the double identity - a great role for her and she performed wonderfully. I got strong Sun Li from Empresses in the Palace from her for some reason. Her chemistry with Deng Kai as the ML was off the charts! Deng Kai - gotta be honest, half the reason I started watching was for him. I discovered him earlier this year in Love of the Divine Tree, where he ended up being my favorite character apart from the leads, he was so good as a goofy, trying-hard-to-be-a-demonic-overlord-but-failing side character that I was as much invested in his plotline as in anything going on with the CP (and for reference I was *very* invested in that CP). The ML in this drama just fits him perfectly, and he's so good as the morally grey (but hot) prince where you're constantly wondering if &gt;!he's going to kill or kiss the FL !&lt;(sometimes the ML didn't seem to know himself lol). It's nice to get a ML who isn't some super young, baby-faced guy who looks like he got plastic surgery, but instead someone slightly older, more mature and not conventionally handsome (by idol cdrama aesthetics, I basically swooned whenever he swaggered around lol). The CP were honestly amazing together, it's one of the more interesting CP dynamics I've watched in a long while. Two hot, scarily smart people &gt;!constantly trying to use each other, but also trying to navigate their feelings of attraction!&lt;. I loved how&gt;! their experiences mirror each other and they eventually recognized each other as soul mates, and you could see from the acting rather than the dialogue (which was deliberately kept vague on this) how and why they gradually fell for each other.!&lt; Fun fact: according to MDL, the two VAs who voice the FL and ML respectively, Jiang Cong and Wei Yifan, are married. Which I'm sure added to how hot and intense the dialogue between the CP is. They both performed well I think. **Tropes:** &gt;!A lot of 'ML saves the FL' over and over, but what I liked about it was that it was mostly the FL manipulating the ML into rescuing her, so she became the one in control (most of the time)!&lt;. Also some ridiculous &gt;!'cut away from the scene when x character is about to die, then later explain how it all turned out fine because they had a cunning plan'!&lt;. But it was executed well enough that I didn't mind. **Ending (minor spoiler but no details)**: &gt;!I was convinced it was going to be a sad ending, but it's a happy one.!&lt; **Detailed ending spoilers (rant):** &gt;!Honestly as sweet as the ending was, it was kind of dumb. There should have been an extra episode to clear everything up. Like how did the ML escape? why didn't he just let the FL in on his plan to fake his own death - it would have been so in character for them both to plan a final, elaborate hoax. And wouldn't it have been better if Pei Ji just took the throne - I know he'd have to kill the young emperor, which he wouldn't do even though since he wouldn't kill a child (although by the drama's own timeline the emperor should have been an young adult man at this point). And I know the FL wanted a safe, peaceful life. But come on, the ML just killed all the remaining generals except one (who's patrolling the border region), the emperor is a dumb kid. Who is going to keep the country together and rule properly if not Pei Ji? This was a little unsatisfying (but I'm happy Pei Ji survived, would be criminal to let a character this hot die, and the FL deserved some happiness).!&lt; **Final thoughts:** This drama really shows the strengths of the short format - it allows for tight storytelling and fast pacing with all unnecessary 'fat' trimmed away, while maintaining a coherent story. I hope it's a success in China that can inspire producers to make similar dramas with this level of quality. And I hope to see Zhao Xixi and Deng Kai get more good, meaty roles, preferably in long-form dramas (Deng Kai has already been in several regular cdramas, but it seems like he's mostly delegated to supporting roles). Both of them are really too good to not get bigger roles."", ""My reflections on The Untamed, and Favourite Moments (Unforgettable experience). Please be mindful of spoilers in this post! And beware, this is quite long. 😅 So sorry. (I’m nervous to post this!) I just finished \\*The Untamed\\* a few days ago, and I don’t think I’ll ever forget the rollercoaster it took me on. I came into it with high expectations, but the way it managed to be both funny and heartbreaking, while also full of quiet devotion between the characters, affected me more than I expected. Wuxian and Wangji have changed my heart forever. The affection I feel for their bond is something I know will stay with me for a long time, it feels too precious to let go of. Every glance, every quiet gesture, every act of care between them hit me in a way I’ve never felt with any other story. I started The Untamed mostly out of curiosity for its popularity, but I wasn’t expecting Wuxian and Wangji’s relationship to affect me as deeply as it did. I’d never stepped into the BL drama world before, and after watching this, I can’t imagine any other pairing sharing a bond as deep and meaningful as theirs. I wanted to share some personal reflections on the ending, talk about my favourite, \\*\\*unforgettable\\*\\* moments and share how some of the characters made me feel. **Ending thoughts** To be completely honest, watching the ending was really stressful for me. Episode 50 felt like finally witnessing two soulmates who had been through everything arrive at the moment we’d been waiting for, yet it wasn’t fully shown. When they parted, I struggled to believe what I was seeing and felt uneasy. After losing Wei Ying for sixteen years, it was painful to watch Lan Zhan walk away from him, I couldnt understand it. I also had trouble accepting Wangji becoming Chief Cultivator. I haven’t read the novel myself, but I saw comments from readers saying it didn’t fit his personality, and I found myself agreeing. If his promise was to fight evil and protect the weak, couldn’t he simply travel the world alongside Wuxian, fighting evil and protecting the weak without needing any official title, and still fulfil that promise? The weight of their separation hit me so hard that I felt anxious and heartbroken just watching them walk away from each other. After learning more about the censorship the drama faced as a BL, it clicked, and I understood why the show had to end this way. The separation was more of a compromise, a way for the show to wrap things up within the restrictions, while still slipping in that final moment of Lan Zhan and Wei Ying returning to each other. Understanding this helped me release some of the conflict I felt. The pain of their parting softened because I knew that in any true version of the story, Wangji would never leave Wuxian. I’m currently watching the special edition, and I’ve read that there’s no separation in this version. I’m so glad this exists, even though I haven’t finished it yet. Just knowing that Wangji and Wuxian stay together in this version makes me feel a lot better about the ending, and it’s comforting to see the ending play out the way it was truly meant to. **Favourite Moments** **Episode 27**: I will never forget the moment Wangji cried. From the first time I saw this scene, I could not stop crying. I found myself returning to the scene again and again, even as I continued through the rest of the show. I’d cry just thinking about it, at random moments throughout the day, at work, as I brushed my teeth etc. It broke my heart again and again, but made me love the show even more. I think I’ll remember it for a long time Leading up to this moment, Wuxian rescues the Wen Clan remnants, all branded as enemies by the other clans, who see them as unworthy to spare. To the cultivation world, Wuxian’s choice looks like rebellion. But to him, it’s simple: they are innocent, and their lives deserve protecting. I could feel the isolation Wuxian must have felt, standing against a world that refused to care. It was heartbreaking to watch this moment unfold. When the two confront each other underneath the rain, things become really emotional and Wuxian asks Wangji what orthodoxy he is supposed to be rebelling against when that same orthodoxy allows innocent lives to be sacrificed? Wangji is clear about Wuxian’s heart, not why he uses unorthodox methods, but that he wants to fight evil and protect the weak. Up until now, every unconventional choice Wuxian has made, mainly his turning to demonic cultivation since returning from the Burial Mounds, challenged the strict black-and-white world Wangji had always known, and went against everything he had been taught. Still, Wangji, in this moment knowing Wuxian as he does, understands the moral conviction behind his actions to save the innocent Wen people, and steps aside. I wanted him to follow Wuxian, to step outside the boundaries of his upbringing, yet I understood why he was hesitant. Following Wuxian would not only mean breaking the rules and abandoning the discipline instilled in him since childhood, but it would also implicate the Gusu Lan Clan itself. His actions could never be his alone, they carried the weight of his family, its reputation, and its legacy. He understood Wuxian’s heart and his intentions, yet he restrained himself, unable to step outside the path he had been raised to uphold. I felt his hurt, his conflict, his torment as if it were my own. Everyone views him as dangerous, but Wangji does not. He did not accuse Wuxian of rebellion or try to stop him. In the end, he watches silently, his expression a quiet mix of concern, understanding and acceptance, accepting that Wuxian was going to do the right thing no matter how much it would hurt him (Wuxian), even as it meant he was turning his back on the cultivation world and declaring rebellion in the eyes of those who misunderstood him. He steps aside, and looking so pained, a tear breaks out as he watches Wuxian ride away into the distance. I felt so much heartbreak that I couldn’t stop crying. That single tear carried the full weight of his hesitation, his quiet conflict, and the pain of watching Wuxian leave. I know it reflected the heartbreak of watching someone he had come to care for deeply, someone he had faced life-and-death situations with, walk away on a different path, despite their shared bond and aligned goals. The music that played over the scene was utterly heartbreaking as well. I later realised that I had heard this OST being played many times before, but it had never moved me until this scene. Here, it perfectly captured the pain of their separation and the depth of their bond. **Episode 18**: During the childhood flashback on Wuxian’s first night at Lotus Pier, the siblings were shown walking back from the woods together. The siblings’ theme song (called Yanli’s theme) starts playing, this time with singing. Hearing it sung for the first time in this scene, after having only heard the melody as an instrumental throughout the show, made me really emotional. The music captured the quiet, beautiful moment and highlighted the depth of Jiang Chen, Yanli and Wuxian's bond. The singing caught me completely off guard, adding an extra layer of emotion I hadn’t experienced before for their bond, and it made their connection feel even stronger amid everything happening around them (the Jiang Clan Massacre). It reminded me of the siblings’ unspoken connection, their struggles, and the closeness that carried them through that moment. **Wangji Drunk (the second time):** I cannot forget the drunk scenes, Yibo’s acting was flawless. He genuinely looked drunk, without feeling exaggerated or over the top. After Wuxian carried Wangji to the bed, I thought it would be over, but the show kept giving us more and it was impossible to stop smiling. How they ended up on the outskirts of the city cracks me up every time. It was hilarious seeing Lan Zhan stealing and gifting those 2 chickens to Wei Ying. I love the way Lan Zhan’s eyes scanned his surroundings until his gaze landed on the pole. Wuxian’s concern as he chased after him, followed by the shock of realising Wangji had written “Wangji was here” on the pole, was priceless. And then, Wuxian going back to write “Wuxian was here too” was pure high school energy… so sweet and heartwarming. I loved how concerned he was, for someone as reckless as he is. The next scene was Wangji fighting the masked intruder. It was awesome to watch drunk Lan Zhan fight like he wasn’t drunk at all. I loved how Wuxian backed off and let him take on the fight, he trusted him completely while still being there to support him if needed. And the way Wuxian had to stop him even though the masked man was gone. SO CUTEEEE. The water scene was equally adorable. Wuxian helps Wangji drink, holding the cup for him with a mix of patience and exasperation, as if Wangji might be being a little inconvenient, but it’s obvious how much he cares. I loved the way Wangji presses his lips together after drinking, to show how thirsty he was. Just so cute I can’t. And of course, this counted as an indirect kiss, since they drank from the same cup. Their question-and-answer time also made me feel a mix of sadness and joy. Seeing Wuxian in this moment, smiling and laughing so freely, I could almost feel the weight lifting off him, like a glimpse of the carefree, joyful teen he had been sixteen years ago. It was the kind of happiness that hit me in the chest, bittersweet because of everything he had endured. I loved how he didn’t ask Lan Zhan outright how he had known it was him at the mountain in episode 2. Earlier in the day, Lan Zhan had told him to think about it, and even while drunk, Wuxian respected that, choosing not to cheat for the answer. Lan Zhan’s sleeping position is also really funny. It also just made me think though, how grateful I am that the Gusu Lan Clan enforces a set bedtime. Because if I lost someone for 16 years, I don’t think I would be able to sleep at all. **Episode 26:** One of the moments that made my heart skip a beat was during the Jin annual monster hunt, when Wei Ying and Lan Zhan meet in the forest. Wei Ying asks Lan Zhan about how its been for him rewriting the rules, but instead, Lan Zhan says he’s been practicing music and asks if Wei Ying wants to hear it and see if it has any effects. Wei Ying responds, “Who am I to you? Can you mind your own business?” It’s heartbreaking because, as the viewer, we know he’s trying to brush Lan Zhan off while hiding the truth about losing his golden core. Then Lan Zhan quietly turns the question back on him: **“What am I to you?”** My heart melted for them!!!!!! I couldnt stop covering my face. It was so moving to see who they have become to each other. Up until this point, Lan Zhan had warned Wei Ying about the dangers of demonic cultivation with concern, but Wei Ying had interpreted these warnings as accusations, creating a subtle tension between them. Hearing this soft exchange about their feelings gave me butterflies, and I felt so moved and emotionally fluttered. **Episode 35:** Another moment that had me completely captivated was when Lan Zhan quietly offers to carry Wei Ying. Wei Ying immediately brushes it off, saying it would look unsightly, but Lan Zhan, quietly asks, **“Is it unsightly?**” 😭😭😭❤️ MY HEARTTT! The intimacy of the moment just melted me... I love them so freaking much. I also felt a little sad though because Lan Zhan reminds Wei Ying that he had once suggested carrying him, but Wei Ying doesn’t remember. I wish he did, it would have made the moment even sweeter. **Episode 42:** I loved the scene where Wangji takes Wuxian to escape the treasure room together. (After everybody finds out he’s Wuxian because he was able to unleash his sword) Wuxian is already seen as a common enemy, yet Lan Zhan openly protects him, taking charge without hesitation and making sure no one can hurt him. It’s such a heartwarming moment, and I just love every second of it, the way Wangji doesn’t hesitate, doesn't care about his reputation, the trust between them, and how completely he puts Wuxian first even in a tense situation. Then comes the part where Wangji openly declares that he knows Mo Xuanyu is actually Wei Wuxian, drawing his swords toward everyone and causing them to stumble back in worry. It’s exactly what he wished he could have done sixteen years ago. Meanwhile, Wuxian is still trying to protect him, speaking in a nagging voice, insisting him to pretend he got tricked. Then comes the moment Wuxian realises that Lan Zhan is serious, and with a sighing voice, he warns him that there’s no going back, Huanguang Jun’s reputation will be ruined if he leaves with him. I loved the tension, the trust, and the way that exchange captured everything about their bond, all in just a few brief moments. It gave me that incredible feeling of them against the world, standing together no matter what. I was so happy. I just love them. I love them together so, so much. Lan Zhan’s right there, side by side with Wei Ying, in full support. It’s thrilling, intimate, and so emotionally satisfying because it shows that in the middle of chaos, they rely on and protect each other completely. **Episode 43:** During that snowy night in hiding at the Silent Room in Gusu, when Wei Ying said it didn’t matter to him anymore who was playing the other flute, I understood that too, I didn’t care either, what mattered then was that Lan Zhan was by his side. In that moment, all I cared about was the two of them and their connection, it felt so touching. He reflects on how everyone who once trusted him is gone, but then he looks at Lan Zhan and realises that having him by his side now is enough, and he drinks to him. Their thoughts mirror each other so beautifully, carrying such deep devotion, and you can just feel it in your heart: (Viki Subs) **\\* Wei Ying: “Thankfully.”** **\\* Lan Zhan: “There’s still someone who believes in you in this world.”** **\\* Wei Ying: “Lan Zhan, cheers to you. Having one soulmate in this life is enough.”** **\\* Lan Zhan: “Nothing else is needed, it’s just a matter of clear conscience.”** **\\* Wei Ying: “I don’t care if they defame or slander me. As long as I have a clear conscience.”** **Other Characters** I never really liked the fact that Yanli ended up marrying Jin Zixuan. Even though she clearly loved him and cared for him, I can’t get past the idea that she chose to marry into a family that was openly hostile toward her brother, Wei Wuxian. Jin Zixuan never really stood up against his family for how they treated the Wen Clan remnants, using them as live bait, and yet she still decided to join that household. I understand that she married for love and obviously cared for him, and I can’t argue with that, but I can’t help the way I feel about it. Maybe on the second rewatch I’ll be able to watch it with a new perspective. From the first watch her relationship with Jin Zixuan felt underdeveloped. At the same time, I truly admire Yanli, she loved Wei Ying and Jiang Cheng so deeply, believed in them to the very end, and never blamed them for anything. Her loyalty and care make me respect her, even if I struggle with her choices. As for Jiang Chen, I understood him throughout the show. I understood how Wei Ying’s rebellion against the other sects would put him in a difficult position. He carried the weight of the entire clan as its new leader. He was also deeply hurt because Wei Ying had broken his promise to be his right-hand man. Yet when he sought to end Wen Ning at the Burial Mounds, showing no gratitude for the siblings who had once saved his life, I found it impossible to care for him in that moment. I couldn’t justify him any longer. By the time he apologised at the end, it barely moved me, because my heart had long been fully invested in Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian. As a viewer, forgiveness felt almost irrelevant because Wuxian already had Wangji. What did it matter? One soulmate was enough. I also didn’t like the resentment Jiang Cheng carried toward Lan Wangji throughout the show. He constantly blamed Wei Wuxian for saving Lan Wangji in the Tortoise Cave, believing it angered the Wens and caused the slaughter of his family. I understood why he felt that way, but I still didn’t like it. I like how Wuxian could tolerate Jiang Cheng reprimanding him, even scolding him for his actions, but he could never tolerate it if those words spoke ill of Lan Zhan. This was especially clear in the Ancestral Hall at Lotus Cave, where Wuxian immediately got defensive, showing just how deeply he cared for Lan Zhan. Xiao Xingchen: What happened to Xiao Xingchen and Song Lan was incredibly heartbreaking. I feel like their story runs parallel to Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji, showing us a version of them that never found a happy ending. It felt like a warning. I wonder if Wuxian reflected on it, making him appreciate Lan Zhan by his side even more. Seeing their fate made me realise just how meaningful it was for Wuxian to have Lan Wangji with him, and how precious their bond truly is, and how easily it could be torn apart by the cruelty of others, like how Song Lan lost Xiao Xingchen. Also Xiao Xingchen is so handsome. Another random thought, I wished after the initial 3 month separation Wuxian had asked Wangji about his leg. It was never mentioned again after the Tortoise Cave Arc. A small moment like that could have added a lot to their connection and shown Wuxian’s care more deeply, especially when there was so much tension during their reunion because of him using demonic cultivation. I find myself listening to the opening song on repeat these days. When I first watched the show, I only saw it once and skipped it throughout because I didn’t want to get spoiled, but now I love it so much. I love the orchestra at the beginning, the delicate and sad qin playing followed by the flute, and then the way it transitions into that war-like, intense music. It’s so beautiful and perfectly captures the story’s mix of quiet intimacy, tension, and epic struggles. **Final Reflections** I really enjoyed following the story overall, but toward the end, I did get a bit lost trying to keep up with the connection between the Yin Tiger Seal, the Scarlet Peak master, his saber, and all those details, it didn’t fully make sense to me. I found myself rewinding a lot throughout the show to make sure I understood everything, but by the end, I was so invested in Wuxian and Lan Zhan that the rush of seeing their story play out made me lose track of it. The final arc in the temple felt a little anticlimactic since it was already obvious that Jin Guangyao was the villain. Honestly, I was expecting a bigger, more epic showdown with Wuxian and Wangji against the cultivation world, more fighting scenes rather than being confined in the temple. Maybe it’ll be more fun to watch a second time, now that I have no expectations and already know how things play out. It will also be easier to follow the plot on a second watch! Anyway, to wrap things up, Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji were the heartbeat of the show. From episode 33 onward, every scene they shared, never leaving each other’s side, meant everything to me... When the whole world turned its back on Wuxian, Wangji was there. Their devotion, their sacrifices, their longing, that was everything. Watching their journey reach its conclusion was an emotional experience like no other. The OSTs played during the final episode hit so hard it had me clutching my chest, it carried the full weight of their journey while wrapping up the story in such an emotional way. It’s their story, their interactions, their love that have made me fall in love with them so deeply that I never want to forget the attachment I feel to their bond. I won't even try to look for anything that can top this chemistry and pairing. Thanks for reading. I’m so sorry for how long this is. I’d love to hear what you thought of the show, and if the same scenes I loved impacted you the same way!"", 'Story of Minglan (ep 40- End) Thoughts (Very Long Warning lol). Hello! I made a previous post recently about my thoughts on [the Story of Minglan from ep 1-40](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nahv6o/story_of_minglan_thoughts_at_episode_40_long/). And here are the rest of my thoughts for the second half of the drama. **Overall:** First of all 10/10. This drama really took me through it all lol I was SOOO frustrated at some points and almost rage quit but then they would bring me back in. Overall, I think the story was just very relatable, had universal themes, and portrayed *some* things very realistically. Like overbearing family, evildoers not always getting their karma, injustices going ignored, and the awkward stages of falling in love. In the middle of the drama I at first thought it didn\'t need to be too long and they could have cut it, but by the end I was wanting more episodes! I wanted to see Molan get more of her karma because sorry did not like how she got away with sending lady Kang to mess with her pregnant sister whose husband was away on duty! Or I would have loved to see more of the full cast together like at the end. It was a very heartwarming scene of them rebuilding the Gu ancestor hall. I did have some qualms about the final battle episodes and the political intrigue stuff. Like first of all, why did Minglan leave her baby to be guarded by a freaking 8 year old and an old woman lol It worked out in the end but I was like girl you didn\'t have one more spare warrior to be in the room with them?? Then, secondly why was Minglan like I\'ll go to the battlefield while everyone hides?? Like girl what were you and Xiatao going to do. Then the long con the emperor and others pulled was interesting; it made for good TV but realistically there were so many ways it could have gone wrong and was risky. Before I get into all the politics I wanted to say that eventually I caught up with everything, but it was kind of hard to keep up with everyone they were throwing at us and all the lore so idk I wish surprisingly maybe those parts were slower because they were kind of background characters that all of a sudden came to the forefront so I had to always circle back and remember which general was which who the prince was and the rest of the imperial gang. Then, regarding this gang I thought it was so crazy how dumb the noble consort was and how she misjudged the situation. Like at the end of the day the Empress Dowager because of such an important role can do everything including murder and still get more consideration than the average person. So for the consort to stake everything onto this plan with someone who can get away unscathed was a little dumb. Like she could toss you out whenever and she did. The Dowager got away with planning a rebellion, got the noble consort\'s child, and her whole family executed all because she was an old woman who didn\'t feel needed or important anymore. In hindsight it\'s kind of crazy what she got away with due to her reputation. I really think the noble consort misjudged the whole power scale. At the end of the day the emperor is the emperor and he wasn\'t that unpopular with the people. So to team up with dowager who can get away with anything while you\'re just a lowly concubine was dumb. I felt a similar way about the Gu family members who kept fawning over the stepmom when Gu Tingye had all the power. What benefits were they getting sucking up to her? Meanwhile Gu had a great reputation, had the title, was head of the household, and favored by the emperor yet they bent over backwards for this woman who to me seemingly had way less power than him. She may have been an elder and more respected but Tingye held all the cards. Finally, there were parts where I wondered if things were really that bad in the past. Like it had to be an over exaggeration right? I’ve watched other Chinese historical dramas but the way Minglan and others were so restricted seemed over the top. Like Lady Kang had ties to the imperial family from her father, yet she could get away with killing concubines and others, maybe it was because her family covered it but still seemed like an open secret. Meanwhile Minglan has a direct living husband favored by the emperor and she doesn\'t even dare turn a concubine away. It seemed weird. There were times when it felt like somebody could get stabbed in front of a crowd and in this drama they’d have the one who got stabbed scared that they’d get in trouble for telling or convince themselves to just grin and bear it. **I think that was my biggest gripe with this drama. Justice took too long to come and when it did it wasn’t very satisfying . The good people had to swallow too many slights** A lot of the time the bad people got away with a lot due to reputation or their punishments/ deaths seemed too quick. Like Gu\'s stepmom met a a terrible end but it bothered me her mask wasn\'t more publicly exposed. But I guess in actuality this makes it more realistic the fact that the bad guys got away with a lot. Or the more I think of it, I myself come from an immigrant family background and there is a lot of this ""Family helps family"" mindset even if family is terrible. So you know what while not as extreme it is kind of relatable. Like there\'s that obligation for someone who is doing well to take care of others especially the family in America, you don\'t ""cut people off"" even at their worst, the oldest siblings are responsible for a lot, and you are ALWAYS considering your reputation so you can brag to other aunties and uncles. So I guess in that way the drama did mirror real life and those societal expectations. I also think the key word of the drama was **contentment** so many characters could have saved themselves grief if they were just CONTENT and lived well. Instead their greed and striving led them to lose everything or to scheme in the worst ways. And thinking back the Noble Consort did help me understand this OBSESSION with reputation. The fact that she and her brother-in-law were the traitors and planned a rebellion yet everyone in her clan had to pay the price was crazy. I better understand now, not excuse it but understand, why people like Minglan\'s father acted a certain way. In a world where 1 person\'s actions can get your ENTIRE family killed yeah you\'d be a little careful or cautious about your reputation lol. But overall I think despite the injustices and frustrating parts there were even greater parts to this story. Like ugh I feel so empty now without it lol But anyway onto the characters! **Characters:** First of all.. SHOUTOUT TO THE MVPS!! --&gt; **CHANGBAI, XIATAO, and GRANDMA SHENG** Hands town top tier characters. Not much else to say about them except they were amazing. I\'ve seen alot of historical dramas where the favored maid dies so I was so scared for Xiatao but glad she and the others got their happy endings. She was so loyal and selfless and her child actor was so adorable! Changbai too despite all the privilege had the strongest sense of right and wrong. I loved him because he had truly unwavering character. He applied his morals the same across friends or foes. He saw through facades and supposed good reputations and could see who was a genuine person. I loved when he dealt with the Kang matter and was willing to sacrifice his future because he knew it was right. Or his friendship with Tingye because he saw despite some actions he had a good heart. The Grandma like what else to say. I was about to quit when I thought she was going to die. The depths of her kindness for Minglan and her sense for the family just no words. The drama would not have been the same without her.Just had to praise them first lol Then, I want to give spotlight to what I think was my favorite storyline. **General Shen and family** Once I understood the whole dynamics I truly saw this story as the most tragic in the show. The fact that the general went away to fight and came back to find his wife killed. He was stuck between a rock and a hard place. He wanted to honor his dead wife, but then had an obligation to his new wife and political pressure. I understand he wanted to do right by his wife\'s family but it was disgusting how they kept leeching off her sacrifice. At the end of the day the little sister didn\'t giver her life or her brothers so they need to stop acting like they\'re owed something by the husband. His wife\'s little sister the concubine was just so evil. She could have been taken care of in other ways but she chose to serve as a concubine. Then poor Lady Zhang. I CRIED at that scene of her old parents coming to comfort her after childbirth and being there for her. Even though she was an adult you could really see the parental love for her. At the end of the day I couldn\'t blame anyone in the situation, well except the concubine she was wild glad she got locked up lol But I felt bad for Shen\'s sister who just felt lost. One second that concubine was her family and in-law and they were happy, then in an instant her sister-in-law is dead and everything has changed. They are in the capital and looked down upon due to their customs. I\'m glad it resolved but this truly was such a sad side story for everyone. **Minglan**\\- Sighh . I really do love her character but her “play dumb” act got old quickly. Sometimes you do have to fight back and I believe Minglan was too passive at some parts . She wanted to avoid conflict but just being harsher in the moment would have saved her grief. Like for the concubine she did accept I feel like it was so unnecessary. They weren\'t even married a year and people were shoving concubines in her face. I feel like she could have lived freely and done that much to turn her away. Because that same concubine almost ended up killing hers son! That could have been avoided if she just got rid of her earlier. And ugh I would get so frustrated that she didn’t understand Gu!! It was obvious! She kept saying she was so confused but idk why!!! She’s smart . It was obvious Gu wanted her to wear the docile wife facade for the public but open up to him in private. He’s not a traditional guy who cares about rules so I don’t know why Minglan was acting like being the cookie cutter wife would appease him. Anytime she showed her personality he loved it and anytime she was too obedient he acted out, that should have been clue enough for her. I get she has the childhood trauma and it takes time because realistically they would have dealt with this in the dating stage but none of that in a Chinese drama lol straight to marriage. But yeah I don\'t know why she was being so dense. Minglan puts that face up for outsiders and Gu swore to protect her and she wouldn’t have to worry. Instead Minglan kept her guard up around him so unconsciously she was showing Gu that she didn’t fully trust him. So I get his frustration, if she can’t fully trust him why even agree to get married?? I’m glad she came around but that was frustrating as heck. I also understood why he was mad at her meeting with Qi Heng. Here she was privately meeting and risking her reputation but for Gu though she had done a lot she still stayed within rules and bounds. So it wasn’t like he thought she would cheat it was in his view her stepping outside the rules/ throwing caution away for someone who wasn’t her husband. Basically Gu kept trying to tell her do you love me for me or out of obligation so me or Gu Tingye the magistrate? Idk why Minglan was so freaking dense about this. I’m not saying she had to be overly affectionate overnight but it would have helped if earlier she just said “I do love you but it will take me time to be more comfortable since I’m used to hiding.” Again she was such a strong character, but there were times I wish she fought back a little bit more to save herself heart ache. But she fought back when it mattered the most like for Tingye and her grandma. **Gu Tingye:** I used to think sometimes Gu wasn’t that great either for dragging Minglan into things and the his family drama but then I realized they’re very equally matched. Even if she’s married into a peaceful household I feel like the average man at this time would fold or cower in face of a harsh up or leave Minglan to fight alone. At least Gu is right there with her willing to fight for anything . Still Gu made some stupid mistakes. I HATED anything with Man Niang because it seemed like everyone got stupider around her. Like it was obvious she was no good when she went and ruined Gu’a proposal to Minglan’s friend. And then he caught her selling stuff. Instead of watching her , tying her up, or banishing her that night he just said we’ll let you have free reign and be gone tomorrow morning. It just felt dumb considering all he had dealt with and seen in his family. Then when she came back it was so obvious the son wasn’t alive but he let the issue escalate so much. I guess it was the emotions but it was frustrating to watch everyone act like there was any evidence of this kid being alive. I saw a comment that I agreed with. Basically Minglan just saw her try to strangle her own daughter but thought this woman could be reasoned with. So parts of me were mad that Gu led such a reckless life before because that negative reputation did bite him in the butt at times. But at the end I surprisingly thought he was the more mature one between him and Minglan. I think they were equally yoked but realistically could have used more time to get to know each other before marriage. Oh also I guess brief note about Tingye\'s dad. I kinda wish they had a more proper resolution but I guess that\'s true to life sometimes. The ambiguity of their relationship was done well. In some ways his dad did care about him, but he was also a very selfish person and not a good one. So there\'s this moral greyness with him and their relationship. Likewise, Tingye hated him at times and how biased he was, but at the end of the day only wanted his love. Another tragic story. **Gu family:** So terrible and shameless. They needed help when the brothers were in prison but can’t even muster a sorry towards Gu Tingye and gossip about Minglan. Just disgusting people. The family isn’t even nice to each other but torment Gu who never did anything to harm them. Just vultures praying on weakness then retreating behind the excuse of “we’re family .” Again, I didn\'t understand this mindset. It showed how entitled they were because just by groveling or flattery they could get more from Gu. Instead while THEY needed help they dare continue to mess with Tingye or demand things get fixed even though they were the ones who did wrong. WORST FAMILY in the series, well tied with Kang I guess. Then tbh I did not feel bad for the eldest brother in law. He bore such a grudge and hated Tingye without seeing the obvious facts. The stepmom was scheming and the other relatives never cared about him or his family. I wanted him to be more humble at the end and just say sorry. Instead he tried to insist Gu’s suffering and achievements were due to the clan when he did it all on his own. It’s sad that the kindness or morals of people like Minglan or Gu get ignored until someone needs something. So now that you’re dying the same relatives you’ve been plotting with for years can’t be trusted to raise your child or take care of your widow? You dare beg for the same sibling you tortured for years and who never did anything to you. I did feel bad for his wife and child because he seemed to be a good dad and husband but he also wasn’t a good person. He kept helping the terrible people in his family. And if he had succeeded in harming Gu what was his plan then for his wife and child? Did he think his selfish family members would really help him? Lastly, the stepmom was just so evil. I think that was my biggest issue with the drama. I wanted her to get exposed. She was just so vile hiding behind concern but also blatantly plotting murder and for no good reason! Her only motivation was that she was so miserable herself, that she was dedicated to sowing discord in her husband\'s family because he didn\'t love her. It was honestly enough to pity her. To be that miserable that you can\'t stand to see someone happy. She was literally fighting a battle with herself because Tingye was never out for her or trying to get ride of her and his 3rd brother. He had a good relationship with his brother and she probably could have gotten anything she wanted. Instead she chose to hate so much and cause her own demise. I love how even her son was like ""Why do you insist on fighting him??"" and she legit had no real answer. I guess the resentment she had truly drove her mad. **Qi Heng-** I lost respect for him as the show continued. He is someone that doesn’t know hard times. Like during the interrogation he had closer connections than anyone to the rebel prince but didn’t offer to face the same punishment as others. Instead he sat in judgement. He is just so privileged. At first I felt bad for them but he acts in ways without consideration of others because he’s never had to consider others. The whole emperor debacle and political scenes frustrated me because he’s going after the emperor over something so petty. He doesn’t seem to actually do good or help others. It’s just a title to him. Unlike Gu he would never sacrifice his life for somebody else. He was the picture of a spoiled boy. Nice until you deny him something then you’ve wronged him greatly. Like with Gu he hated him but Minglan was never Qi Heng’s alone and Gu gave him ample time to “claim” her if he wanted. He again just thought whatever he wanted would come to him so he didn’t fight for Minglan. BUT I did come around to him at the end and I was happy when he let go of his bitterness and became a true ally to Minglan. Still his character was very childish. He and his wife were cute towards the end but she also annoyed me with her jealousy at first. I\'m glad she didn\'t scheme or act on it but it still was weird because Minglan was a fully married pregnant woman. Realistically what could she do or how was she a threat? **Sheng Family** **Father-** DEADBEAT. I have never seen a more useless father. He was a true disappointment. But that scene where Minglan schools him and he\'s left reaching for that game piece did make me tear up. Just the image of an old man realizing the weight of his mistakes was beautiful. Still he was straight trash. The fact that he hit his pregnant daughter Minglan because she was demanding justice for HER GRANDMOTHER, the woman who RAISED HIM when she did not have to. His concern for reputation over family was disgusting. While I understand it, he still sacrificed true peace and harmony for outward appearances. He stood for nothing. At every conflict or at the face of every injustice he chose to run, cover it up, or just sweep it under the rug. I\'m glad Minglan could somewhat deal with him by the end but he was a terrible man. **Big Madam (First Wife, Lady Wang):** You know what at first I viewed her like Rulan. They are a little obnoxious and selfish but they mean no harm. But I hated her by the end. She was truly spineless. The grandma was right that Concubine Lin\'s antics covered up her own follies. Even though she didn\'t mean to kill the grandma the fact that after 1 scolding her response was to still POISON an old woman and make her sick was ridiculous. And the grandma was only looking out for her! Even Minglan pointed out her grandchild, Changbai\'s son, could have easily eaten the poisoned pastry and died or gotten seriously ill. She dragged the whole family down due to selfishness. Because she had no one around to cajole and coddle her she sought out her evil sister and let herself be manipulated. Minglan NEVER caused her any trouble yet with a few words by her sister, the Big Madam thought Minglan was getting too full of herself and would try to take over Big Madam\'s place. Her character was really ruined for me at the end. **Rulan**\\- I wish we saw more of her after she got married. Even if it was more of her sisterhood with Minglan or some mini-story about how things were with her husband. I feel like she just vanished. **Molan**\\- I slightly spoiled her fate for myself because in the middle of watching I looked up what happened to the character because I was so sick of her. And I saw that she lived an unhappy life. So I was just expecting more. I did have mixed emotions at the end. Like I wanted her to get more punishment because at the end of the day she was terrible to Minglan and Rulan for years, KILLED a concubine and her child just like her mom, and whether or not her husband loved her she still got a title and to live in luxury. I kind of wanted her to suffer more. But then at the end when she was with the family I did feel bad and was happy she finally accepted their kindness. At the same time, she knew Kang had evil intentions and let her go free knowing she could hurt Minglan. I didn\'t like how her role in things never got uncovered. She was another character that you could almost pity for being so miserable. Even her brother pointed it out. She was the wife of a duke (I think?) and still she wasn\'t happy and striving for more. She was always wanting what others had. **Wang Family/Kang** \\- Overall most EVIL family right next to Gu. The fact that they so casually talked about covering up murders for Lady Kang was ridiculous. Until the last moment the mom had no remorse for how she raised her daughter. She was willing to bring down her whole family, her in-laws, and herself to save one spoiled child. I\'m glad they got their karma. I also didn\'t understand the mom\'s logic. She prodded the son to make a name for himself. But the dad\'s reputation allowed them to literally get away with murder lol To me that seems pretty strong and that it was enough to keep their head down and do well. Instead, the mom wanted to be greedy and align herself with the Dowager. Because of that her son and her family paid a big price. Then for **Lady Kang**\\- DEMON! I did not expect her to be one of the worst characters. Truly no words. She was just like Stepmom Gu though. So miserable in her own marriage that her resentment just spilled out onto others. If I read the subtitles right, she sold one of the concubine\'s daughters to her old-aged father-in-law. That\'s disgusting. Then she was outright killing people. The fact that Minglan serving her the consequences of her actions made her set fire to her house while she was in labor was wild. And she tried to kill the baby! Just terrible human being. Last one **Random Kang Cousin/Almost Concubine**\\- Idk I just thought this character was so funny because she stabbed or threatened to stab herself like multiple times within the 2 episodes she was featured in. She was freaking crazy lol']"

I’ll try and describe as much as I can possibly remember,the Asian (can’t remember which particular country) series (older series maybe 2010) is introduced with 4 main characters two boys two girls (both girls have dark hair ones got more of a bob the other one is longer) .Not long into the series one boy (pretty sure he’s smart with glasses )is shown to be leaving and either moving away or changing schools (pretty sure there is a scene before he leaves of the group of 4 walking away from school and the boys splash the girls with water from their bottles and then run away laughing whilst the girls chase them ).This group of friends are quite rebellious and it’s maiming based about them being troublesome in a school environment .Not long into the series a girl is introduced with blonde hair into there class .Another factor I can remember is the series introducing a new male home room teacher ,since I’m pretty sure the last teacher left due to to how hard the class is to teach with pranks etc .The class does start off pranking him and bothering him however buy the end of the series they are all really fond of him and even protect him from getting fired if I remember correctly since that teacher doesn’t want to give up on the glass (there is one scene ,where on the teachers first day they prank him with with pretending that a girl (short haired one from the main group )is dead/injured to see how he reacts to try and scare him). In the school you have the main three rebels (the two girls and boy) ,you also meet another shy boy in there class who they take under there wing .You also have the blonde girl (if I remember correctly she is usually wearing pig tails )and then another main character you see is another rebellious boy (think he rides a motorbike )who does not get along with the main boy actor in the series .Whilst all the main plot is going on you start to see the main boy actor and main girl actor with short hair start to develop feelings for one another .You also have the blonde haired girl and other rebellious boy (one which rides the bike )develop feelings for each other .The other main girl who is in the group at the start has feelings for the smart boy that left to change schools /moved at the beginning of the series once he returns .I’m pretty sure even the male home room teacher ends up having a love interest with one of the female teachers at the school . I can remember some other small bits a pieces so please help me find the name of this drama cause it’s driving me crazy I haven’t watched it in so long ,if you have any questions I will try and answer as best as possible .tysmmmmm (sorry for spelling mistakes or if it’s worded perhaps wrong).', ""looking for a specific cdrama i watched on the tv in my childhood!. hello everyone, im in need of some help. ive watched this chinese drama when i was a kid on the old box style televisions, and over the years ive actually thought about the drama here and there, but have always not been able to find it. ive tried everything.. every search engine, even tried china based ones, and now, even tried chatgpt. but no one can get it right! i desperately wanna watch it again. i dont remember much, but the plot was that there is this fox demon who is a lady, who is the main female lead. she just came to the 'human world' and is innocent, and pure, and is willing to learn the ways of the human. she got caught by an old guy, who happens to be a master at killing demons, but he took her in instead and have her as a disciple. there is also one other disciple, another human girl, so the 2 girls quickly become friends. then came along this 1 human guy, who is a promising soldier, he lost both his parents to a demon, so he hates demons to the core and swore to be strong and eradicate one day. he is good friends with the old guy, so he visits often, hence thereafter getting close with his 2 disciples. after awhile the female lead (fox demon) falls in love w the human soldier gradually and as days go by, they both spend more and more time together. soon the guy seems to like her too, and one faithful day, she plans to tell him the truth. she leads him to an old abandoned temple, and told him that she has something to show him. she morphs back to her fox demon form, and when the human guy realized what had happened, has full hatred for her, forgetting all their past times and memories, and even tried to kill her there and then. she managed to escape, hiding back at her master's lodge, heartbroken. next day she chills at a nearby lake, filled with sadness. i remember this scene had the OST of 孟庭苇 meng ting wei 's 月亮的脸 yue liang de lian ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvJAkhKI\\_cw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvJAkhKI_cw) ). funny this is thats all i remember. i dont remember if i have forgotten the rest of the story, or that i got busy and just was never able to catch the program on tv anymore when i was young. please, for the entire life of me i have been wondering what show this is. trying my luck here, and if anyone knows, please let me know!! thanks in advance!!"", ""I need help finding a drama I saw on tiktok a year or two ago.. I've searched google but haven't had any luck despite having some specifics of the show. I only watched a few episodes and I'm pretty sure it was on youtube but I can't remember for certain. There shouldn't be anything too spoiler-y in this since I only saw the beginning but beware just in case. I wanna say this isn't a very old drama but it should be complete and it's probably a K or C drama rather than a J drama but I can't swear to it. So I remember the FL is part of a higher end family, maybe ministers or something but I don't think royalty. It's not a historical drama but also didn't feel like a modern drama either? Like there aren't cars that I remember but there was a handgun I wanna say. The FL has a half, illegitimate sister by her father who is treated kind of like a maid in the house. The first episode I wanna say opens with the family being attacked and the FL's parents being killed, but she survives because a guy traps her in a room and ties her to a bed post. She thinks this guy is the one attacking the family if I remember correctly so she escapes the room and runs away. She had a previously arranged marriage with a guy from another family so she runs to his family for help after the attack only to find out her sister got to the house first and has assumed her identity as the legitimate daughter of the house. When she arrives her sister claims that the FL is the illegitimate daughter and she has some document she got from the father during the attack that makes the family side with her so the FL is beat for it but ultimately brought in. Details after that are a little sparse since it was so long ago and I only watched a bit but I remember: the fiance being a bit two-faced, the guy who traps her in the room during the massacre is actually the fiance's uncle(and the ML i think) and she swears to kill him for what he did to her family, the sister threatens the FL to keep quite because no one will believe her, the uncle was only trying to protect her but wont tell her the truth because it keeps her safer if her attention is on him, and the sister at one point gets slapped by the fiance i think. That's about all I can remember. It feels like plenty to find it but I've had no luck.. TLDR: drama where the FL's bastard half-sister steals her identity and fiance after their family is massacred and the FL only survives because her fiance's uncle is protecting her.""]"

And we get those international wins with our artists (like Charice, Ms. Reg). &gt;But recently, based on past interviews, a lot of OPM artists have been vocal na lumalaki na ang presence ng local music as a whole. &gt;BINICHELLA is proof. Slowly, global music markets are starting to pay attention to us. &gt;We’re already building a presence of our own. &gt;I believe BINICHELLA will open more doors for Filipino artists. After all, the rise of OPM doesn’t fall on one group. It falls on one building the hype, opening the doors, and joining forces para ipalaganap ang ganda ng ating musika. &gt;I am also hopeful that this will be the start of P-pop to be taken more seriously — in my case, I don’t have to fight with editor all the time who claims na “SB19 and BINI” lang ang umiingay (and other insensitive remarks that no artist deserves to hear). &gt;I also hope this reminds management teams, music labels, and our government why we need to invest on local music, arts, and culture. Parang if BINI can make it, so can we. &gt;A lot of artists (and their teams) put SO MUCH WORK to deliver a good performance — even if imperfect ang iba. Even if kulang pa sa resources ang iba. &gt;And to a Threads post who claimed the girls are “not ready” for Coachella, no one will ever be ready. But they took the leap. &gt;Some are doubtful, pero trust in the girls. Trust in their preparation. Trust in their grit. Isa ito sa mga pinapangarap nila — kaya no doubt they will do everything they could to pull this off and do well. &gt;[\\#OPMRise](https://x.com/hashtag/OPMRise) and [\\#PPopRise](https://x.com/hashtag/PPopRise) is still [\\#OPMRise](https://x.com/hashtag/OPMRise) and [\\#PPopRise](https://x.com/hashtag/PPopRise) — kung sino man ang mauna, sino ang masunod. What matters is that everyone in the community are in this together. &gt;We always talk about the Filipino throat chakra — so let them flex that Filipino throat chakra. &gt;A win is a win. Whether it’s Coachella, hitting a million streams, performing on global stages (ang DAMI na recently), and reaching other achievements. 🩷 &gt;It’s valid for others to be upset. Pero it shouldn’t be a reason to rain on other people’s parade. &gt;Let us be happy for the girls. If hindi ka pa rin masaya, it doesn’t hurt to be indifferent, and let things be (or block things off). 🩷 &gt;Imagine seeing Filipino kids looking at BINI on Coachella — and being happy that someone who looks like them is there? &gt;So ayun lang, napa-thread na ako because puro negativity laman ng timeline ko (even on Threads) and nakakastress na siya. &gt;Why can’t we all just get along? Our faves are friends and/or oks naman behind the scenes. Iba kaya power ng mga Pinoy when we join forces. [source](https://twitter-thread.com/t/1968122651026854397)']"

Here is a summary of major drama announcements, drama posters, trailers released for iQIYI's September 25 iJoy conference. 📣 For announcements, two dramas came with main cast and creative team reveals, while the rest offered only partial information – such as a director or source material. 📸 The platform also released individual posters for many of their upcoming dramas. I’ve compiled them all into this post. A few dramas had more than one poster so I combined them to fit within Reddit's 20-image limit. 📽️ Nearly 40 trailers were shared during iQIYI’s conference day. At the bottom of this post, you’ll find a summary list of all drama titles and links to the trailers that day. Additional posters are in the comments of the trailer threads. 📊 For those who enjoy stats and figures, I’ve included view counts taken earlier today for each trailer. One 🔥 = 10K views (rounded up); just a fun little heat index for our sub. 😅😂 Please keep in mind these were posted over half a day on September 25 so time zones (and probably Reddit's algorithm) may have some influence on the numbers. It's been a few weeks since the trailers and posters dropped so the view counts have mostly stabilized – perfect timing to share the stats. The list is sorted from highest to lowest total views. These figures provide a general snapshot of engagement in the sub across iQIYI's upcoming dramas presented on September 25. This data is intended for informational purposes only. *** #Drama Announcements Two dramas were officially announced along with their cast: 📣 1 - [Ball Lightning 球状闪电](https://mydramalist.com/680929-ball-lightning) * 🎬 Directors: [Dai Mo](https://mydramalist.com/people/14287-dai-mo) (Detective Chinatown 1900, Endless Journey, Sheep without a Shepherd 2, Detective Chinatown) * ✍️ Original creator: [Liu Ci Xin](https://mydramalist.com/people/50181-liu-ci-xin) (Three-Body, The Wandering Earth 1 and 2, Crazy Alien) * ✒️ Screenwriter: [Chen Si Cheng](https://mydramalist.com/people/4814-chen-si-cheng) (Detective Chinatown 1 and 2, Lost in the Stars, Great Expectations - Twin Dragons) * 📖 Novel: [Ball Lightning 球状闪电](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%90%83%E7%8A%B6%E9%97%AA%E7%94%B5_(%E5%B0%8F%E8%AF%B4)) * Official filming start: April 25, 2022 * Distribution license obtained: June 2025 **Cast:** Leading actors: * Tong Yao * Wang Anyu * Yang Lixin Special guest actors: * Zhou Yiwei * Ding Yongdai Special appearances: * Yang Jue * Feng Wenjuan *** 📣 2 - [Abyss 深渊游戏](https://mydramalist.com/768859-abyss) * 🎬 Director: [Liu Haibo](https://mydramalist.com/people/34371-liu-hai-bo) (Trident Season 2, Brocade Odyssey, Thirteen Years of Dust, The Glorious Era, In the Name of the Law, The Rise of Phoenixes) * ✍️ Original creator: [Shen Lan 深蓝](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B7%B1%E8%93%9D/63855897) (Endless Journey) * ✒️ Screenwriter: [Nie Chengshuai](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%81%82%E6%88%90%E5%B8%85/59761961) (The Examination for Everyone, The Heart of Genius, The Devil between Us), [Guo Kaixu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%83%AD%E5%87%AF%E6%97%AD/66790833), [Xiao Shiyao](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%82%96%E8%AF%97%E7%91%B6/58374704) (Get Married or Not, Medical Examiner Dr. Qin), [Luo Dingyi](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%BD%97%E9%BC%8E%E5%B1%B9/66790835) * 📖 Novel: [Shen Yuan 深渊 (Abyss)](https://m.douban.com/book/subject/36641699/) * Filming production started: early October 2025 * Official booting ceremony: TBA * Filming time period: 70 days * Filming location: Ningbo, Zhejiang Province **Cast:** Leading actor: * Allen Ren Jialun Leading actor: * Qin Junjie Special starring: * Wang Yanhui * Tian Xiaojie Special guest actor: * He Bing Special appearances: * Ni Hongjie * Hao Ping * Zong Juntao * Zhang Yichi *** The following dramas have the director, screenwriter, original creator and/or original works announced that day, i.e. no official cast (images 3 to 5): 📣 3 - [Take a Nap 海岛舒服日志](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B5%B7%E5%B2%9B%E8%88%92%E6%9C%8D%E6%97%A5%E5%BF%97/66248702) * 🎬 Director: [Liu Chang](https://mydramalist.com/people/65911-liu-chang) (director: Our Ordinary Days, Go into Your Heart;

[https://asianmoviepulse.com/2025/07/film-review-dollhouse-2025-by-shinobu-yaguchi/](https://asianmoviepulse.com/2025/07/film-review-dollhouse-2025-by-shinobu-yaguchi/) Though Shinobu Yaguchi is much loved today by fans and critics of Japanese cinema alike for some of the best contemporary slice-of-life comedy films the country has to offer, he has in the past also dabbled with the horror genre for TV. After the longest break of his career thus far, with his last work coming six years ago with 2019’s “Dance With Me”, and as fans waited with bated breath for his next output, he surprised everyone by returning not with another comedy in the ilk that he is known and loved for, but with a new production in the horror genre. Yoshie Suzuki leaves her five-year-old daughter, who is playing hide-and-seek with her friends, alone at home as she runs to the supermarket. Upon her return, she finds her daughter suffocated to death, having tried to hide in the washing machine. A year passes, but Yoshie is still guilt- and grief-ridden, until she brings home a beautiful life-size doll from an antiques market and treats it as if it were her daughter. Dismissing it as Doll Therapy, her nurse husband Tadahiro lets her have her way, until Yoshie gets pregnant again and gives birth to their second daughter, after which the doll gets put away in storage. However, when their daughter Mai turns five, she finds the doll and takes her out to play with it, which is when strange incidents start to occur in the house and around the family.

Her topic is quite harsh, since it involves a case of a relationship between a school student and a teacher that ended in a double suicide and a social outcry that completely ruined the lives of both families. Yuko’s focus is in presenting the truth in the most genuine way possible, but the channel producers prefer to have a tamer program, which will present the whole case as a student-versus-faculty deal. Despite the unspoken threat of no air-time at all, Yuko is set to present the whole truth, which involves interviewing the families of both deceased’s, which are initially reluctant, though, to speak in front of the camera. Apart from a director, Yuko also teaches in her father’s, Tetsuya, cram school (in a comment highlighting that one cannot live just on shooting documentaries). One of the students there, Mei, seems to have a health issue, and Yuko soon finds herself helping the girl in all aspects, as she reminds her much of herself, particularly since they both grew up without a mother. The two of them come quite close, but soon Yuko finds herself face to face with a scandal that is about to break much closer home, threatening both her life and her career. As the twists about what is actually happening come crashing, Yuko has to face a number of dilemmas revolving her various capacities, and her issue of simply caring too much.

FUCK!*”. Soon, after his death, I decided that I would start seeing his work from the beginning to know why he was so beloved. I’ve had zero interaction with his works, and honestly haven’t been curious until recently, watching *Absurd Encounter with Fear (1967)* was the first time of seeing the absurdity in which other talk about his work, absurd in a way, just have to suspend all disbelief and let things happen without questioning. I continued watching all the shorts I could find until *Eraserhead (1977)* his first full length film. The work to make that baby as realisctic as they could, incredible unsettling but babies are alien at times. I think *The Grandmother (1970),* is one of the most disturbing short I’ve seen so far, the depicition of child abuse, was a lot to take in.

I really enjoyed *Asura (2025)*, the difference in sisters and how they all have to come to each others aid in different ways, in different moments of their own turmoils. It really made me want to return to see his full length films, It is based on Kuniko Mukōda’s novel of the same name. Going back and starting to see earlier works, has helped me see what themes these directors are tackling, for Kore-Eda, he is very focused on the human aspect. *In When Cinema Reflects the Time: Hou Hsou Hsien and Edward Yang (1993),* it focuses on two Titans of Taiwanese cinema, both influenced by different aspects of the country, and on another layer of history, Taiwan being colonized by the Japanese and Kore-eda own father being born in Taiwan. I need to further explore the influences between Hsien and Yang towards Kore-Eda own work, considering Edward Yang has been very high on my list. I should research this more throughout the year. ***August Without Him*** *— Sypnopsis* One of his Documentaries, released in 1994, followed his friendship with [AIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS) # My year in film - January - March 2025 My outlook on this year film direction, is coming together, im thinking about filmography and being able to see progression of directors, My outlook on this year film direction, is coming together, im thinking about filmography and being able to see progression of directors, so far this year # David Lynch (8 films) *Absurd Ecounter with Fear (1967)* I’ve never seen a David Lynch, I knew few references, I always enjoyed the video showing his anger and annoyance at not being able to keep shooting until he calls cut, how everything had become so constraint by tight shooting schedules, how he “*can’t go dreamy anymore.

The documentary, titled “August without him”, followed Kore-eda as he met with Yutaka and filmed his life between 1992 and 1994. During this period, he speaks openly on his condition, as well as being the first Japanese to admit he contracted the disease via homosexual contact. The film ends with Yutaka’s condition having deteriorated, and he died of AIDS Complications on May 29, 1994. Next Up, is *Maborosi (1995)* ***Filmography*** ***When Cinema Reflects the Time: Hou Hsou Hsien and Edward Yang (1993)*** ***August Without Him (1994)*** ***Asura (2025)*** # Lee Chang Dong (1 film) Peppermint Candy(1999) ***Filmography*** ***Green Fish (1997)*** ***Peppermint Candy (1999)*** I have to preface with *Lee Chang-Dong’s Burning(2018)* is one of my favorite films of all time, currently #12. *Peppermint Candy* has been showing up on my feed for a while, and recently I downloaded it. Due to issues with my internet, I dedicated time to all the films that have been waiting to be watched. The premise of this movie, follows the rage of Yong-ho (Sul Kyung-gu), who is on the edge of commiting suicide upon an incoming train, the movie then takes us back to moments of his life that brought him to this point. Returning all the way to high school, in a moment of deja vu, he can not contain tears of his future self grief at a failed life. Thinking about the movie after finishing, sitting in my feelings can not help to notice the incredible acting by Sul Kyung-gu. Looking up *Chang-Dong’s* filmography, there has been a lot of familiar titles when talking about asian cinema. I wasnt thinking about continuing his filmography but *Peppermint Candy* changed my mind. Next Up, is *Oasis (2002)* # Nagisa Oshima (2 films) Diary of Yunbogi (1965) Nagisa Oshima has been on of my favorite directors and he solidified that position last year as I started going through some of his other films, Death by Hanging (1968), completely taken aback by so much, how heavily political it is, really made me love it, “*How can I be killed by an abstraction*”. With his filmography, I have been all over the place but wanting to return to his earlier works to see what he had been working, as with trip to Korea, always touching upon the political reality of many people, imperialist forces after the war, korea state after its demarcation by the US. In *Diary of Yunbogi*, you can slearly see the influence of *Chris Marker’s Le Jetee (1962)* in its use of photographic still and narration. **Diary of Yunbogi — Synopsis** Consisting of a series of diary entries narrated by a boy over photographs made by Oshima himself during a 1964 trip to Korea, *Yunbogi’s Diary* is a highly political tale chastising Japan’s involvement in Korea. Oshima confronts his country with the mess it made during the occupation. ***Filmography*** ***Tomorrow’s Sun (1959)*** ***Diary of Yunbogi (1965)*** Next Up, is *Street of Love and Hope (1959)* # Sara Gomez (6 films) Ire a Santiago (1964) **Biography** Sara Gómez aka Sarita Gómez was a Cuban filmmaker. As a member of Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos during her early years, she was one of only two black filmmakers in attendance. She was the institute’s first and for her lifetime, Cuba’s only, woman director. Watched another Cuban director, wasnt excited his short film shot around the same time as Gomez it wasnt a focused, felt more like student work. Her work was more naturalistic, Ive heard her name mentioned sparsely through some readings but excited to see themes explored in her longer works. It is an unfortunate that during her lifetime she was the only woman director from Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográficos. ***Filmography*** ***Viejo Plaza (1960)*** ***Fabrica de Tabaco (1962)*** ***Ire a Santiago (1964)*** ***Guanabacoa (1966)*** ***Isla del Tesoro (1969)*** ***Poder Local, Poder Popular (1970)*** Next Up, is *Y … tener sabor (1967)* # Shunji Iwai ( 5 films) Kyrie (2023) “All about Lily Chou-Chou” (2001) was the first film I watched from Shunji Iwai, I went in blind not knowing what his films were like, only going based of stills on Twitter. I felt the movie really touched on the forum experience of the early 2000’s and really integrated that into the movie through its overlapping text. Looking over other well known japanese film, Iwai’s work makes several appearance, and I wanted to see how his work developed, I ony knew him from this one movie and wanted to go back to the beginning, his interest in the nostaglia and how he selected music resonated with me. I am excited to continue, especially adding more songs to my spotify. Next Up, is *Love Letter (1995)* # Filmography ***Omelette (1992)*** ***Fried Dragon Fish (1993)*** ***Fireworks, Should We See it from the Side or the Bottom? (1993)*** ***Undo (1994)*** ***Kyrie (2023)*** # Shuji Terayama (7 films) The Cage (1964) Poet, playwright, novelist, photographer, sports critic, filmmaker and cultural agent provocateur Shuji Terayama (1935–1983) was among the most broadly influential and innovative figures active in the post-WWII Japanese avant-garde. Throughout his all-too-brief but astonishingly prolific and multifaceted career, Terayama deliberately confused boundaries between high and low, between history and myth, while working inventively across different media. Terayama’s intermingling of theater, film and photography was an especially important inspiration for his visionary art practice. Beginning with his precocious and often controversial engagement with traditional *tanka* poetry as a mere teen, Terayama held tight to his belief that genuine artistic creativity was rooted in the act of shattering molds in order to cast them anew.¹ ***Filmography*** ***The Cage (1964)*** ***The War of Jan-Ken-Pon (1971)*** ***Laura (1974)*** ***Young Person’s Guide to Cinema (1974)*** ***Labyrinth Tale (1975)*** ***The Woman with Two Heads (1977)*** Next Up, is *Pastoral: To Die in the Country (1974)* # Tsai Ming Liang (4 films) Vive L’Amour (1994) ***Filmography*** ***Rebels of the Neon God (1992)*** ***Vive L’Amour (1994)*** ***My New Friend (1995)*** ***Days (2020)*** *Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003)* stands as my #1 all time movie, I was deeply moved by it, the dialogue is beyond minimal in what I thought could be possible. Watching *King Hu’s Dragon Inn (1967)* elevated the movie even more for me, beyond being a classic of the wuxia genre, to combine it with act of transportation we all encounter in going to the cinema. That final scene between the two elder men, witnessing their youth through the movie, the passage of time. Days (2020) His earlier film, Tsai still hadn’t yet dove into slow cinema but you can see that he is slowly building and what he would be known for. The most recent film of his I watched, was *“Days” (2020)*, took his minimalism even further, in which only dialogue that needed translation was subtitled, showing how a whole conversation was without subtitle because it wasnt necessary but to be taken on the journey of two men. Their daily lives until the meet up with each other, and then return back to their lives, with what felt like less than 10 mins of dialogue but nothing is lost because dialogue is sparse, you can feel all the emotion through what is depicted. Next Up, is *The River (1997)* # Toshio Matsumoto (5 films) The Weavers of Nishijin (1961) Matusmoto’s was one of the first introduction into experimental film, I found him through an account on twitter that posted their own list of experimental cinema, started with Matsumoto’s *Atman (1975),* I continued and fell in love with *Phantom (1975)* and the incredible *Funeral Parade for Roses (1969).* I’ve watched a lot of his experimental films, some I loved and other that didnt resonate but most of all, I enjoyed the exploration of how he wanted to play with the medium. Final Films —*Demons (1971) &amp; Dogra Magra (1988)* ***Filmography*** ***The Weavers of Nishijin (1961)*** ***The Song of Stone (1963)*** ***Relation (1982)*** ***1986 Summer (1986)*** ***Engram (1987)*** # Suprises *Duvidha — Mani Kual (1973)* *Petit Maman — Celine Sciamma (2021)* *You Hide Me — Kwate Owoo (1970)* *The Ghoul — Sodsri Phakdeecht (1940)* *Dragon Inn — King Hu (1967)* Footnotes: 1.

So I have been watching anime since ig 3 months? or maybe a bit more. And yk what, I LOVE IT. I always thought of it as childish cartoons but after watching it, I realised that there are soo many values and ethics and such great feelings and emotions that I can learn from and enjoy! I fell in love with the Japanese culture asw (call me stupid 😭). So, here are what I started watching in order and finished:- 1. Attack on titan (stopped at a certain part; too complicated for me) 2. Demon Slayer (amazing anime) 3. Black Clover (again, a great anime) 4. Solo Levelling (THE BEST IN MY OPINION) 5. Gachiakuta (a very modern and different kind which i love) 6. Watched One Piece until they enter the island (its been long so kinda forgot) Then, I started watching romantic anime (just gave it a try) 1. Watched ""The Fragnant Flower Blooms with Dignity"" because it was very popular among insta reels and saw a bunch of edits. and let me tell you, IT WAS THE BEST EXPERIENCE MY WHOLE LIFE. LIKE, EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT LOVE AND AFFECTION CHANGED! 2. Watched My Dress Up Darling. let me tell you, I cried like a dog cause the ending didnt satisfy me and I want another season where things actually get real! 3. Watched Horimiya. Didnt love it as in romance as much as 1 and 2, but still a great anime! It was very funny and an excellent comedy! 4. Just started watching Fruits Basket but kinda unsure maybe not my thing casue I am sooo tangled up in romance that I might even start reading manga! Anyways, thanks for reading the huge list. I want to watch anime which make me cry (tearjerker) and also has romance in it (A LOVE STORY WHERE THEY GET TOGETHER WITH A HAPPY ENDING AT THE END). Maybe, the guy trying to make frnds but unable to or smh as that (cause I can relate it to myself). Thanks for the suggestions :)) 4.', 'animerank.top - A website for grouping anime entries as franchises for better rankings (solving the Gintama problem). [https://animerank.top](https://animerank.top) I created a website for grouping anime entries as franchises. The goal of this is mainly for better ranking (I\'m looking at you, Gintama) and for better browsing instead of manually traversing MAL webpage or anilist to explore a series. MAL\'s data for anime relations is really complex like performing graph traversal on Gintama with ""Other"" relation type returns 700+ entries as a single franchise which is really bad. **After many experiments, this is the best filter I came up with to group franchise entries.** * Included: `Prequel, Sequel, Alternative Version, Side Story, Summary, Full Story, Spin-Off, Parent Story`. * Excluded: `Alternative Setting, Character, Other`. **MAL Anime Relation Types** * `Alternative Setting` can be anything, but one example I found is ""Steins Gate"" having an ""Alternative Setting"" entry called ""ChäoS;HEAd"" which I believe should NOT be counted as one franchise in the context of anime rankings. So I decided to exclude Alternative Setting. * `Alternative Version` on the other hand is mostly remakes. It is good to include this. It\'s explained below in the Remakes section. * `Character` relation type is mostly character crossovers. Example: Isekai Quartet which is connected to a bunch of series. So I decided to exclude this in grouping too. BUT, my code algorithm actually processes Isekai Quartet as its own Franchise which is a good thing. * `Other` relation type is a whole can of worms. When I included this in the code and processed Gintama, it returned 700 interconnected series as a single franchise. I said NO and removed it from the code. * `Prequel, Sequel, Alternative Version, Side Story, Summary, Full Story, Spin-Off and Parent Story` is the final inclusion list for franchise grouping. The highest entry count for this is called ""Sore Ike! Anpanman"" at 105 entries followed by ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" at 99 entries. # The MATH Okay, everyone\'s favorite subject. I made 5 different scoring models that you can use to sort the anime ranking in the website. * **Weighted Combined (WC)** \\- Score weighted by both popularity and duration within the franchise. Combines both popularity and duration weighting for the most comprehensive score. Longer content × more users = indicates high relevance of the entry. The website defaults to this in the ranking page. * **Weighted Popularity (WP)** \\- Score weighted by number of scoring users within the franchise. Avoids sequel bias - [some sequels have fewer users but higher scores](https://i.imgur.com/cBZGyus.png), so weighting by users prevents this inflation. Side stories and OVAs with low user counts have minimal impact. * **Weighted Duration (WD)** \\- Score weighted by total duration within the franchise. Prevents short OVAs, specials, and side stories from skewing the franchise score. [Longer main content has appropriate influence](https://i.imgur.com/YXvzZVY.png). * **Peak Entry Score (PEAK)** \\- The highest individual score among all entries in the franchise. Simple and can sometimes be accurate - shows the franchise\'s best entry. e.g. [One Piece Fan Letter will carry the franchise](https://i.imgur.com/wYXbz4T.png). * **Average Score (AVG)** \\- Simple average of all anime scores in the franchise. Highly inaccurate - treats all entries equally regardless of relevance. Short OVAs, specials, and side stories can heavily skew the score. # Remakes Let me show you a real example of how this works with [Hunter x Hunter](https://i.imgur.com/DWVYc5C.png): * **Hunter x Hunter (1999)**: 8.43 score, 633,308 users, 62 episodes * **Hunter x Hunter (2011)**: 9.03 score, 3,088,905 users, 148 episodes The 2011 remake has a higher individual score (9.03 vs 8.43) and way more users (3M vs 633K), but when calculating franchise scores: **From best to worst:** 1. **Weighted Combined (WC)**: **8.98** \\- The recommended approach (website default) - balances both popularity and duration weighting 2. **Weighted Popularity (WP)**: **8.74** \\- The 2011 version dominates because it has 5x more users 3. **Weighted Duration (WD)**: **8.72** \\- The 2011 version has more influence (148 eps vs 62 eps) 4. **Peak Entry Score (PEAK)**: **9.03** \\- The 2011 version\'s score (highest individual entry) 5. **Average Score (AVG)**: **8.00** \\- Simple average of all entries (treats OVAs and movies equally) # Shorts, Specials, OVAs, etc Looking at the Hunter x Hunter data, you can see how the weighted formulas handle irrelevant entries: * **Hunter x Hunter Pilot (1 episode, 31K users)**: 7.21 score - barely affects the franchise score * **Movies (1 episode each, \\~200K users)**: 7.28-7.29 scores - minimal impact despite decent user counts * **Main TV series (62-148 episodes, 633K-3M users)**: 8.43-9.03 scores - long duration with high number of users dominates the calculation. The Weighted Combined formula considers both duration AND popularity, so a 1-episode OVA with low user count gets almost no weight compared to a 148-episode TV series with 3M+ users. This prevents short specials from skewing franchise rankings while still including them for better browsing experience. # Issues, Data Errors, Feedback Form There are some franchises that are extremely complex. An example is the Go Nagai Franchise. The automated code fails to group this properly so I had to make some custom config to apply a fix. It\'s still not fully fixed but I\'ve at least separated the most obvious parts like Devilman (8 entries, this contains Crybaby). I\'ve made a feedback form so you guys can submit any issues you find. Or if you believe a certain franchise should be grouped in a certain way. I am sure there are some errors lingering around right now that I haven\'t found yet. [https://animerank.top](https://animerank.top)', 'My Thoughts on Psycho Pass Season 1. Psycho Pass is one of my favorite anime of all time. At least in terms of season 1. It has been ever since I first saw it back in 2014, and while I haven\'t seen it since, after finally re-watching it, (mainly because I just learned how many new installments there have been), I\'m glad to find that it still holds up perfectly. It\'s an amazing anime that I would probably classify as ""mid sci-fi."" What I mean by that, because the term ""mid"" obviously has a different, more annoying meaning nowadays, is a middle ground between soft sci-fi and hard sci-fi. It\'s also possibly my favorite cyberpunk story ever written. This anime, along with Fate/Zero, both of which I watched for the first time in 2014, made me fall in love with Gen Urobuchi\'s writing. His style has influenced my own writing style so much over the past 11 years. He\'s a master of creating instantly likable, interesting, and sympathetic characters, as well as fascinating plots with deep themes that can, in some ways, be allegories for our current world. Psycho Pass takes place in the year 2112, 100 years after the series aired. Japan is the only peaceful country on Earth due in part to the Sibyl system, a type of technology that basically runs the legal system. The Sibyl System, which is represented by dozens of cameras and camera robots throughout the country, is able to accurately analyze a person\'s mental state, known as their Psycho Pass, and determine if they are latent criminals. If their Psycho Pass gets too high they\'re latent criminals and will be arrested and from that point on their life is basically over. There\'s no chance of it ever getting low enough to be set free again. If it\'s over 300 then they are actually to be eliminated. The cops in this bleak future are called Inspectors, and they\'re joined by ""hunting dogs"" known as Enforcers. Enforcers are latent criminals who agree to help Inspectors in order to get some tiny semblance of freedom. Both Enforcers and Inspectors have massive guns called Dominators which have three settings. Lethal Eliminator for criminals who have a Psycho Pass over 300, Non Lethal Paralyzer for criminals who don\'t have a Psycho Pass that high but still too high to be a free person, and if a person\'s Psycho Pass is too low it\'ll lock and is unable to be used. From that alone, I think you can tell what the themes are, even if you haven\'t seen it. It\'s all about free will, and whether a person\'s future can be determined via logical brain analysis. It takes the stance that the Sibyl System is inherently flawed, as the choice to commit crime, no matter how severe or basic the crime is, comes from the heart not the brain; intellectual thought may be used to help someone commit said crime and get away with it, but it\'s still their heart, their emotions, that kickstarts it to begin with. But this flaw goes over the Sibyl System\'s head. There\'s rare people in the world who are Criminally Asymptomatic. These are people who are immune to the Dominators judging, no matter what they do their Psycho Pass reading will keep going down, including that of the main villain of the series Shogo Makishima. The Sibyl System likes to secretly harvest the brains of criminally asymptomatic people and incorporate them into the Sibyl System to try and improve it. And as for another theme, I personally think that Criminally Asymptomatic people are meant to be an allegory for Sociopaths, who are people who are skilled at hiding their own mental illnesses, and while not always, often end up committing crimes because of this. Famously they\'re able to get passed lie detector tests, and the Dominators are kind of like lie detectors with extra steps, so it does kind of make sense to me, but I have gotten push back on that topic before. It does get a bit more interesting though because, like I said before, Japan is basically the only country on Earth that is pretty much close to being crime free. Supposedly every other country is chaotic and war torn, and with Japan being cut off from the rest of the world, returning to Edo era isolation if you will, Japan has been made mostly peaceful. Of course I say mostly because there\'s obviously lots of people who slip through the cracks, and innocent people who are imprisoned or killed, but comparatively. That kind of sets up an insanely more bleak world than you might notice on the surface, where the best country to live in the world is still absolute hell. I kind of love it, honestly. It\'s too bad season 2 was so shit. Okay, so now let\'s talk about the characters. I love Akane Tsunemori. I remember she was kind of controversial back in the day mainly because how she starts which is kind of milquetoast, but I loved her though. She starts very naive and innocent, but after being exposed to all of the horrible stuff the Sibyl System has caused she does grow into a more wise and intelligent leader within the police force, while never completely losing her ideals which conflicts with the Sibyl System, she just learns to operate with those ideals within the system. I actually think she\'s one of the more unique female anime protagonists to be honest. I also loved Shinya Kogami. He compliments Akane extremely well as a partner. They\'re basically polar opposites at the start, but they learn to understand and respect each other by the end, even as they part ways and walk different paths. And Shogo Makishima is probably one of the best and most interesting villains in anime history. He\'s extremely charismatic so he\'s able to manipulate people who are arguably just as mentally unstable as him, or even more, so to work for and worship him, he\'s vastly intelligent, and like I said before he\'s criminally asymptomatic. These last two factors allows him to avoid the Sibyl System for many years, to the point that Shinya Kogami has to take matters into his own hands and kill him with a normal gun at the end of the series. He\'s also interesting in his motives too. He is a psychopath, but he believes that what makes you ""human"" is the ability to act freely on your base, primal desires, and because of that he wants to bring down the Sibyl System, or at the very least bring the truth of it to the public\'s attention, which will cause panic, chaos, and riots. I think a lot of people would still think he\'s a bad person and disagree with his methods, considering that many of them involve killing purely innocent people for seemingly his own thrill, but that\'s another way the series plays with your emotions, because the Sibyl System is bad and needs to be destroyed or reformed, but seemingly the only person who\'s capable of doing that is someone who isn\'t much better, so the only two possibilities of a future that the anime postulates to us is continuing to be controlled by the Sibyl System, or complete chaos and anarchy. All the other characters are great too. Nobuchika Ginoza, an inspector, is a more likable version of the traditional hard ass cop who\'s father and partner betrayed him in the past and become Enforcers. That partner is Shinya Kogami, whom I mentioned before, and that father is Tomomi Masaoka, who is one of the main characters in the series too. He\'s a lot of fun, and his death towards the end of the series is the saddest to me in the entire anime. This confrontation also causes Ginoa\'s Psycho Pass to raise way too high so he becomes an Enforcer serving under Akane by the conclusion. The two best moments in this anime for me are that scene in episode 11, (which i think is overall the best episode too), where Shogo and Akane meet for the first time, Shogo holds one of Akane\'s best friends hostage and tries to goad her into killing him with a real gun. She isn\'t able to betray her morals and end him, so her friend dies and she blames herself. This is the major turning point of the series, where it becomes darker than it already was. And the second scene I want to specifically shout out is Shogo meeting his end at the hands of Kogami in the final episode, (which may also be the best or the second best episode in the series). As much of a monster as he was, I have to respect that there was no regret and no hesitation when he died; if anything, he was happy to be removed from a world that he fundamentally disagreed with.']"

For someone who has cared so much about her family asking her opinion on the matter, we have yet to see Princess Xi Yang ever ask Jing Shi on his own willingness in this matter. There is much left to be seen as far as who these two really are. Will Jing Shi be able to treat Xi Yang with respect and caring? She is clearly trying to form a relationship between them. Jing Shi has already shown himself willing to give up his morals (murdering his previous fiancé) for his larger plan. Our Three Heros of Jinxiu are having a tough time. Sweet, open Ning Fei is actually thinking and this is making him drink. Fu Yi Xiao is starting to practice her archery again. Her hand slowly strengthens as her amnesia slowly lessens. https://preview.redd.it/3qo1ueo3tltf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8617f99af58af86695de46872698caea713fa2d0 The feelings between Yi Xiao and Feng Suige deepen as we watch. He asks why she does things that make those close to her grieve and her enemies glad. Yi Xiao declares, for the millionth time, that her affairs are none of his business. He vows to make them his business and in Yi Xioa’ haste to get away from this disturbing statement, she cuts Sui Ge with the arrow he grasps. You can see the regret that she has caused him pain. https://preview.redd.it/hco2xwe5tltf1.png?width=2040&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9ddf14cfa26866319cc372d7e5aa81395069595 Yi Xiao goes on to set the record straight for what they mean to each other. They are working together, that is all. She has had two questions since waking with amnesia: who killed her? Why did they want her dead? Once she has these answers, the partnership they’ve agreed on will be over. Sui Ge once again alludes that he has personal experience with betrayal by loved ones and shows that he is capable of reasoned, empathetic responses (sometimes 😉 ). After Yi Xiao dismisses his ability to understand her feelings, Sui Ge continues to show his sincerity towards her by telling about the death of his beloved Mother, the previous Empress. In Sui Ge’s mind: his mother was murdered by the now Empress Zhuang, his father turned a blind eye, he was forbidden from ever speaking of his birth mother again, the Nanny he’d grown up with tried to burn him alive to gain favor with Empress Zhuang, and then his swordsmanship instructor used one of their lessons to try to stab Sui Ge through. Wow. Anyone would have serious trust issues after this. Yet he goes on to choose to build family with his siblings and with his military comrades. This moment between our leads feels like the first time Yi Xiao is willing to acknowledge Sui Ge as a person person. Not just a prince, nor a partner whom both are using towards their own ends. But as someone who was once a child, abandoned. I am reminded of Jing Shi saying that no one could touch Yi Xiao when she was first rescued from the death camp. Her shying away and recoiling, almost feral. I am sure that our eldest prince can relate to the hyperawareness that would develop as a result of each of their own child hood traumas. https://preview.redd.it/mkv55o68tltf1.png?width=2004&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b0be95382b8ff3b906897c19f626b0983157d47 Ahh, our one light-hearted and emotionally equal pairing is continuing to develop :p https://preview.redd.it/nc8z34catltf1.png?width=2002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c92746314a73593b06ffd938c8f0921b34149c3d I agree with everyone that our medical savant Ling Xue Ying is a bit sus. Why is she so attached to Yi Xiao? From saving her life? To be fair, if given the opportunity to have friend like Yi Xiao, I’d jump on that too. Xue Ying seems to be at home alone a lot without her father there. She is another one of our cast who is looking to build chosen family. But is she more than just emotionally too alone and a little odd? Is she instead tying herself to Yi Xiao for other purposes? We’ll have to wait to see. https://preview.redd.it/qoy3wuvbtltf1.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2f921fc42fd278c821540054fe3214c6681e12 We learn more about the childhood shared by Ning Fei, Wei Ran, and Yi Xiao. So sad. So horribly sad. To have such ties, and have them broken, when you’d survived again and again through ridiculously poor odds by relying on each other; oofta. The pain of that would leave anyone numb for a very long time. As Yi Xiao is sharing about how their lives were so mutually dependent, we get more “encouraging” this-is-real-life pep talk from our Eldest Prince haha. He points out the everything in life can change. Yi Xiao asks the question on everyone’s mind: can the past really be left in the past? Can we put down revenge? This is the question of this series. Two countries just at war, now trying for peace. Can we truly put down our own pain to allow for the growth of a more healthy world? “If His Highness ordered Yi Xiao’ death, would you kill her or not?” https://preview.redd.it/43q9u4cdtltf1.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e57264fecf0805673d062d1771d55986e907551 Poor Ning Fei is realizing that Sui Ge did not lie. Wei Ran is responsible for the assassination attempts on Yi Xiao. And beyond that -- something I hadn’t thought of – he sent the three orphans who is basically an Uncle to, to be used as bait to lure out their adoptive Mom so that she could be killed. When your “great cause” takes these types of sacrifices from innocent others who haven’t consented, you are not on the right side. Look at Yi Xiao, so ruthless going straight for the sweet potato of memory! Thus, the three Heroes of Jinxiu are no more. Yin Xiao declares she is no longer beholden to Jinxiu and she will not let herself be killed for some “great cause”. Yay! Ning Fei being sent to the secret healers with blood transfusions is interesting. We’ve ended the three heros arc with 1 – missing in action with secret healers; separate from the world. 2 – with Jing Shi; not making their own decisions. 3 – with Sui Ge; living for themselves. Could these mystic healers be related to the strange poison in Jing Shi? To the masked man who is most likely Murong Yao? I do like the outro and intro songs for this series &lt;3 I have yet to look up their translations but the feelings they evoke move me. **Episode 14** Looks like we are getting some more time with Ling Feng, Master of the Righteous Villa. Master Ling Feng seems to have known the late Empress and her personality sounds hilarious! Much like her son. The collusion threads start to be found &amp; we are given our first name: Meng Junran. Rongtong Escort Agency is escorting funds. Fu Yi Xiao finally has her chance to confront Xia Jing Shi. While her memories are still mostly not her own, her emotions and emotional reactions truly feel like they are. Here we see the fateful moment where Yi Xiao doesn’t listen to Jing Shi. And more than not listening, she questions the morals of his choices. He planned to sacrificed the people of Zhennan Pass, not even soldiers, civilians, for his “great ambition”. Once again, we are seeing that like Feng Sui Ge, Yi Xiao is highly principled. She “passes” her morality tests that would come up for anyone in war while the Prince she loved does not. https://preview.redd.it/l3u8za9gtltf1.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc5d7ac8d7f4dc85748669b9bd0d50fcc82e5cc0 We learn even more about the type of person Jing Shi is. He says and believes that if he had even the tiniest bit of soft-heartedness in him, he would not have lived to see this day. Let us all note this about his character and how he has responded to the world experiences he has had. Yi Xiao tells her love that she wants to make a decision for their future, just as Jing Shi claims to be doing. The decision she wants to make is to stop her Prince from continuing down a path of ruthlessness; one that has already led to him condoning mass murder (300K lives in Zhennan Pass). I am touched by Yi Xiao. She concludes with “will you let me?” https://preview.redd.it/ao7zh07ltltf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4276333f663618f1a8790fb24829a0b10bc7d0c https://preview.redd.it/iw8uetbmtltf1.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b6d2ebb71b1b61907672fa2fdd01a6e98279e34 https://preview.redd.it/573kkoentltf1.png?width=2012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ac555146e962ddc66a233c82dca1bccac89e77b https://preview.redd.it/fc3aaceotltf1.png?width=1998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4390ad7fcfa8f01738db1fed7cc228df3ac093ff And so we conclude the arc of: who wanted to kill me? Why did they want me dead? This has been our driving force behind Yi Xiao to this point. Yet these answers are only the beginning of the threads that Feng Sui Ge must unwind. I find this shot of Xia Jing Shi combined with the lyrics “Shadows take root in the mountain pass” well done. Who would not have shadows growing in their mind after murdering their closest, most loved one? To have to confront the truth of your own ruthlessness would be soul breaking. Is this what is meant by having the bearing of a ruler? https://preview.redd.it/rxw0v08qtltf1.png?width=2012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b313105b685b23f8427081da431d96a0b896c7b The closing conversation on the relationship between Fu Yi Xiao &amp; Xia Jing Shi was also moving. Her telling him he looked ridiculous as he pleaded with her to start over with him, that when he shot that arrow, the old Fu Yi Xiao died. https://preview.redd.it/ozaa4pkutltf1.png?width=2022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aeb2ec0c80f24e2856d129a61d99717e4cd0c39 How honorable is Yi Xiao? She clearly expresses her gratitude for being saved by Jing Shi; express that gratitude has been absorbed by him shooting her; lets him know that if they do meet again, they will be enemies. Nothing in the shadows, all open and aboveboard. I really enjoy a forthright person. Closing out Yi Xiao’ past: enter Sui Ge with another well timed catch 😊 https://preview.redd.it/p7f24x6wtltf1.png?width=1922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0136a8ada282e626ef98728ba94a2ab04444e8d6 Yi Xiao offering our Eldest Prince some of her first real softness, first real emotions. I find this smile before she faints beautiful. https://preview.redd.it/9qbutr4ytltf1.png?width=1936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57625da8143804d4eeb79cecf52e4e105aa63469 I’d like to take a moment to say that going around to light all those candles by hand would be an act of pure love haha. There are SO MANY! We learn that the blood clot in Yi Xiao’ brain could burst with too much stimulation. Naturally, we’ll assume this will come back to haunt us later at a very emotional, very inopportune time :p For those of us hoping for my genuine emotional connection time between our MLs, I feel we’ve really started to get into it with these two episodes! Most exciting. WAIT! As our leads discuss the golden armor, I am reminded that Murong Yao gave it to Sui Ge before the attack on Pingling City. Am I remembering that wrong? Or was Murong Yao trying to make certain sure that Sui Ge would make it inside of the city to fall into the trap? Was it a gift made to facilitate the death of Sui Ge? Some potential foreshadowing of future issues for our couple. We learn that the former Empress was a general herself; free-spirited and valiant. Someone who yearned for a life of peace &amp; simplicity, away from the regular hustle of life. Not too dissimilar to both Yi Xiao and Sui Ge. Sui Ge shares that his mother would never have agreed to be trapped inside the palace if it wasn’t for her love for his father. Will Sui Ge make assumptions about Yi Xiao in the future based off of this interpretation of his mother? https://preview.redd.it/a9qk03u0ultf1.png?width=1946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d9603084a3882dc1e6a6451a54ce055a3d7cd05 A loving couple. A happy family. No wonder Sui Ge creates family wherever he goes and values it so much. https://preview.redd.it/jgeih9l3ultf1.png?width=2044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9c79fbdcdb8351dc09144364b56a9f705c8433e Our man is sending out all the signals that he wants her to seek him 😊 https://preview.redd.it/bg7v7f15ultf1.png?width=1652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ef64f93a58da6c55d24f5a67456cc5bc59b2149 Sui Ge reiterates that Yi Xiao can leave; she is a person, not a thing. He offers to find her a beautiful, peaceful place to take her children to. An out from the complicated political things. Hehehehhe I do love Yi Xiao making Sui Ge uncomfortable :p just like the previous scene by the river. LOL an amazing fake out by Yi Xiao! Can Sui Ge be any more cute with his discomfort, shyness, and happiness all rolled into one?!? https://preview.redd.it/uekc4xh7ultf1.png?width=1932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00becc281beb1904fd2ae9aae613823cf95c414e https://preview.redd.it/84qndox8ultf1.png?width=2038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a86fcc780197f70de4731bd65ef7cff105ec3ddd Sui Ge fanning the bug repellant into her sleeping chamber &lt;3 Flowers for calming beauty when she wakes &lt;3 They do a good job so far in this show of making sure we see the humanity in each of our characters. The distant cousin of Empress Zhuang who was supposed to assassinate Yi Xiao is another good example of this. The music that is our cue for love and loss and hope and separation played when he saw his young daughter through the back gate of their home. He loves her and cannot go to her. We see the tension between Feng Sui Ge and Feng Ping Cheng increase. The child is unsatisfied with his father’s handling of the murder of his Mother. I am sure that what the Eldest Prince doesn’t know about the situation is a lot. I am looking forward to this story being unwound more. **What did you think?** · Share your thoughts on these episodes; I’m excited to read what you each have to say! · Let me know any pointers you might have on my hosting as it is my first time.

Let\'s hope this drama will satisfy our needs till the end! **Spoilers** If you\'d like to discuss anything beyond episode 8, please use spoiler tags. **Episodes 1-6 ""We\'re safe now.""** We open with a creative camerawork and flashbackwards to see how our ML, Feng Suige, First Prince of Susha gets taken down with an arrow in battle by our FL, Fu Yixiao, Commander of Jinxiu, world\'s most brilliant archer. There\'s a very cinematic and symbolic juxtaposition of her red dress billowing and his blue cape flowing whilst she\'s high up on the tower and he is falling from his horse. From there, it\'s quite fast paced with unknown assassins in black chasing both Suige and Yixiao. Both fall from a high cliff, but in Suige\'s case, it was just diversion. He also had his battalion, lieutenant, commander and right-hand man helping him. Yixiao, on the other hand, was surrounded, alone, and fighting beyond exhaustion. We get some nice close up shots of her injuries. We find out later that she had just been shot down from the top of a cliff by a mystery person, leading to amnesia. https://preview.redd.it/y3x0xlg2g0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56b91176091943750509af07ae1450a5fc6e55a9 Here is the obligatory bath scene, the romantic trope sprinkled throughout our favourite historical dramas, with our enemies on either side of the hot spring wall, soothing their grave injuries. I guess I have to mention the abs scene as well - it was pretty bang in your face, but I appreciated the 3/4 side angle. These two handled the after bath scene pretty maturely, albeit her now being detained by him. https://preview.redd.it/p2frpua4g0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=babe50924dd219d59a5e08d8fb4a2522b481d6ee *As an aside, I wonder if Cheng Lei will have one in How Dare You. It doesn\'t look like it, so he may have broken his streak. But, there is one to look forward to in Mo Li, and his OG pair, Lu Yuxiao, will have another with Neo Hou in Love in the Clouds.* Suige has Yixiao tortured and she gets flashbacks of her past. She sees herself as child, getting brutally trained, she\'s an adult and we see she was together with the Prince of Zhennan, Xia Jingshi. Suige dresses her back wounds. They are still enemies. https://preview.redd.it/7w5b6fpfi0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d501b7c7ca0f1f4c872fc816d638ea884aae8577 At the gates to Jinxiu, Suige\'s battlion is stopped by one of the Prime Minister\'s sons and his army. Yixiao sees that things aren\'t so smooth sailing for her captor even though he is the First Prince and that his battalion are highly loyal, tight knit and have each other\'s backs. They would lay down their lives for him and each other. He must be a good leader and treats his people well. And then he kills the Prime Minister\'s son with his bare hand. Yixiao is shocked by his power and ruthlessness. https://preview.redd.it/icpfphbbg0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f63273a4c8f54232647d85a4860f55bc37ae4632 The Second Prince\'s coming of age ceremony was scheduled for this day, the day Suige\'s mother died, probably by the Empress, Second Prince\'s mother and Suige\'s father, the Emperor. Suige has a good relationship with his younger brother but the Empress doesn\'t like this. Our leads scheme to make use of each other, a cooperation of sorts. But first, Yixiao must settle some scores. This is beyond crazy. She ties him up in the forest and whips him back the 47 lashes. Random CGI forest animals pop up to be shocked at the bite kiss revenge he then takes on her. Bloody lips, from kissing biting, that\'s another trend. https://preview.redd.it/dw3my2qdg0tf1.jpg?width=806&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ced7496007934cf770dc0693a45ca676ac8c1e24 Oh, hi buddy \\*waves.\\* Zuo Ye is in this too (plays Murong Yao). https://preview.redd.it/egy4yt4gg0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ed218d7b6279414bae94ee069c59b53c3a6d4f5 We have them injuring each other\'s injury. Their banter is very Mr and Mrs Smith vibes. https://preview.redd.it/pdf4g5esk0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7d6531c92cdb6ea12c9d27366e5711bf7dd953e Murong Yao refuses to take back the golden chain mail he gifted Suige. I hope this doesn\'t foreshadow his death. The three children, her disciples appear, looking for her. They are reunited but she doesn\'t remember them. One of them gets kidnapped to lure her out. On the boat, this might be the first time Suige properly comes to her rescue. She gets a flashback to the person who shot her at the cliffs. Yixiao is surprised to see Suige gentle with the sleeping child. https://preview.redd.it/u2spunfog0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be5b9fe026589345b44a2330b6a4018c153d0384 https://preview.redd.it/ejtt80vlg0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df8ad0707bb06b1f3d8379e97e135248ee25eacd In Suige\'s carriage, he sees Yixiao asleep cradling her disciple and wonders why she isn\'t afraid to sleep in the company of her enemy. She wakes wonders how she fell asleep and why he saved her disciple if he\'s meant to be ruthless. They arrive and she says to the child, ""We\'re safe now."" This lingers on Suige\'s mind - she feels safe with him. We end with Episode 6 where Jinxiu has offered a marriage alliance for Prince Zhennan and Suige\'s sister, Princess of Susha. Suige vows to stop it but Xiyang seems not to mind. Suige and Yixiao banter and drink together. https://preview.redd.it/e0d2iuj3h0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c1513ff5a2848d7b762afdaa75cc51acefc65ea **Episode 7 ""Nothing happened last night.""** Waking up to a knife impasse on the bed. https://preview.redd.it/3chn3tr4h0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ee77765d6e48a854f073c4a71fa1e24cdd036e7 Word got out that Suige is opposed to the marriage alliance and there are rumours that the Emperor was going to strip him of his title, that there would be mutiny among his men. The gang finds out that one of their own has gone on a rogue suicide mission to kill Prince Zhennan, Xia Jingshi. With the help of Yixiao\'s archery tactical knowledge, they save him. Suige gives him and his men a powerful and resolute talking to. Xia Jingshi is not worth their lives. There is to be no mutiny. He approved of the marriage. When Xia Jingshi arrives at the city gates, and Li Yixiao spots him. She gets PTSD flashbacks of her past. Jingshi was the one who saved her as a child. He was the one they pledged alliance to. He was one she was engaged to. They had fought together on the battlefield. So she goes insane, swinging Suige\'s sword, she thinks she\'s back in the past, fighting off enemies or in harsh training. We see Suige\'s concern for her. He checks if she remembers him. She does. Luckily, she faints and doesn\'t meet Xia Jingshi just yet. https://preview.redd.it/zd1ay078h0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b143c04d5edc66c3d64bc9c5e45fff0ca7eb4ff6 https://preview.redd.it/fjy6w239h0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=224cd839e325d298eeb9a20f18625192cbd4f447 When we get to Xia Jingshi, the murder music plays and he has a murder face on. He must be the bad guy. His tea with the Emperor is unnerving. He does not show respect and the Emperor comments on it. The Prince replies that he would be subordinate only after the marriage. https://preview.redd.it/fkvvccu9h0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ea64b01148b167e349b1001e2df99c912af86be We end the episode with the revelation that the Princess loved him since he saved her in the desert. She pretended to be miliary and tried to follow her brother to battle. She fell behind in the desert and Xia Jingshi and his men found her. He let her go when he saw that she was a woman. He also threw her his water pouch which saved her life. Okay, maybe he isn\'t too bad after all. https://preview.redd.it/axeprj9bh0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=331d6ba59a1310304db30fdd99fcc00847aec672 **Episode 8 ""You are now my person."" ""I will never be your person.""** The Princess concludes that women aren\'t made for battle and Jingshi says no, he knows a woman who went into battle and became the best hero. So, is he really not the one who shot Yixiao? The Princess notes that she\'s baring her soul to him and he only has thoughts for another woman. She asks for the name of this woman. I kind of like this otp. &gt;! Seeing the trailer for eps 9 &amp; 10, I\'m sad that the Princess looks like she turns bad.!&lt; The princes meet in the street and Jingshi says he once swore to protect Yixiao for life. Suige recognises Yixiao as a human being with autonomy, not a belonging. He says that she is free to go or stay of her own free will. https://preview.redd.it/jfyf6zthh0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0251826ff30bdacd7fab999aee2d90db0bff1b71 Ning Fei was injured by Suige as he keeps the Jinxiu guys away from Yixiao, since the one who harmed her could have been any one of them. Yixiao asks Xueying to treat Ning Fei in case they really were close. Xueying and Ning Fei looks like a ship is brewing. https://preview.redd.it/y6dhb34jh0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3df35e33ca329ee37b4eca09574a44f18d54220 We get a flashback to Suige\'s investigation. They found the token of undercover agents. Agents that can only be commanded by the Jinxiu Prince and military advisor. So, maybe it *was* the Prince. The Jinxiu buddies give Xueying a bamboo whistle to give to Yixiao. It\'s one she used to use so that her buddies could find and rescue her. Looks like they have been through thick and thin together. Suige sees Yixiao trying to do achery practice and stops her from continuing. He doesn\'t want her to ruin her arm before it recovers. https://preview.redd.it/mhe0hxpph0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3633cd0ce61d322f5ba05d7283ac561fd35d5a0a We end with Jingshi and Yixiao\'s reunion and I\'m glad she\'s being guarded and doesn\'t give anything away. Doesn\'t acknowledge that she remembers they were together. https://preview.redd.it/pw9wvvtrh0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=703aa04ec5e2193913290a32b0c40785be32c8ab **I Wonder** So, over to you * What did you think of the episodes? * Is Prince Zhennan the culprit behind Yixiao\'s attempted murder? * Will he fall for the Princess?', 'Fated Hearts episodes 29-30 discussion. One of my favourite things to do is to analyse a CDrama\'s Chinese title. So, Fated Hearts is **一笑随歌** in Chinese. It\'s actually their names to gether ""yi xiao (one laugh/smile) and sui ge (with a song ~~smile~~). So, ""A Smile with the Song"", which implies harmony. The smile and the song are companions; they exist together. It paints a picture of someone smiling *while* singing or listening to music, capturing a moment of joy.

Alas, I actually feel sorry as she crawled on the ground crying and begging to return home. [And the OST comes on reliably at that moment](https://preview.redd.it/10gvova9j2vf1.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=705dcee335db38405a42f872bb76e5d39dcdbfdb) And wow, pray tell, is the emperor\'s expression softening during this scene? He even looked ... kind. I get the weird impression that he\'s like a teenage boy taunting the girl he likes. :P Their interaction in the next few episodes is basically this: insults/threats -&gt; slaps/violence then 👇 Xiyang: OMG he\'s so gross Jingyan: OMG she\'s so hot [Honestly, how is Jinxiu even functioning right now with this emperor](https://i.redd.it/vdqinnx8k2vf1.gif) Xiyan wants the empeor to find out the truth about her brother and father\'s deaths. # Jingshi is plotting (yawn) How is Jingshi reacting to all this? At one point he even offered to help Xiyang but I have a hard time interpreting his expressions, so I\'ve NO idea if he meant it, is trying to do something shifty, but the *sad music* comes on, and so I suppose is sad. Is it Xiyan who is sad? Jingshi? Who knows man, because interpreting Jingshi\'s expressions is harder than cracking the Enigma code because he looks like this: https://preview.redd.it/lwid5osvk2vf1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1ad6bb1365c844916b86736fcbe2616d4ab1ad1 No hate against the actor but lord help me can you emote a little more? I swear a block of wood has more movement than his facial muscles. And since the actress who plays Xiyang can act circles around him, his lack of acting skills is even more stark beside her. Each time he appears on screen I sigh and feel the urge to just fast forward. I know Jingshi is planning something nasty overthrowing emperor stuff, but I don\'t give af. I\'ll stay awake for his inevitable demise, however. # Storm Alliance It may be called the Storm Alliance, but to me it\'s the Hippie Commune of ~~Bloodthirsty~~ Jianghu Sages but it\'s a mouthful so we\'ll stick with the Alliance. Ning Fei is fine now but he isn\'t very happy in that village. Turns out he\'s having some real survivor\'s guilt. Love Ning Fei, loyal to the bone but not the brightest bulb in the universe because he immediately outs Feng Suige. See, apparently the emperor tried to wipe out the Alliance, and one of the rules is that every Feng has to die for that. Never mind that he is Qingyu\'s son. (Hey, isn\'t that a tad unfair? What has the son gotta do with the emperor\'s sins? Doesn\'t his mother\'s DNA count at all? Geez.) Later, I find out why Elder Lei and the main chief of the Alliance was so mad, and understandably - their children died in the siege. But there\'s a big chance it was Prime Minister Zhuang who did it, so I hope this doesn\'t escalate. (lmao who am i kidding) I immediately love Elder Zhou because he seemed nice. (I will come to &gt;!regret this once I see the previews lmao!&lt;) We find out how Qingyu, Suige\'s mum, came to found the Alliance. Now I can understand Qingyu\'s mindset. We find out more about how she founded the Alliance. After being badly injured, she got tired of war and decided to create the Alliance to help the victims of war, and Dr. Ling was there from the start. I can see how all the palace intrigue and pettiness felt pointless compared to what she was trying to achieve with the Alliance. # Xiyan pays the price The emperor finally meets someone more crazy than he is. A match made in Bonkersville. May the couple be blessed with many sane children. Actually, jokes aside, I don\'t know if I\'m supposed to ship them but there\'s one thing certain, being intimate wit the emperor disgusts Xiyan: https://preview.redd.it/5n7qroian2vf1.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47e060faa87ab0d6f2a3abdb7867e31878032300 Yet the kiss was uhm, hot. https://i.redd.it/mjar8zown2vf1.gif Stop it show, you\'re confusing me. I\'m not sure if I should feel yuck about this CP or ship it hard. \\*sweats\\* Also **Why does our mad couple have more kissing time than our leads dmanit, i protest** The morning after - we can see clearly that the whole act has broken her a little. I guess her romance novel marriage dreams are done and dusted. Anyway, I don\'t know whether to feel sorry that she has to use the age-old weapon of femininity: sex - to achieve what she wants or be proud of her for her ability to manipulate the toddler emperor. I guess I take back what I said about her being unambitious. She\'s incredibly ambitious, and can be cunning and determined to get what she wants, as she told the empress. To quote someone on xhs: ""Siuge takes after his mom, Xiyang takes after her dad"". Yet, I feel a little sad that she had to resort to this, lose her innocence like this and had to learn her lesson in such a terrible way. Suige is going to be SO MAD. Speaking of which ... # Suige is on the edge of death While the Alliance dallies with deciding whether he should be treated, Suige is closer to death. But finally they get the okay to proceed. https://preview.redd.it/4qiout57p2vf1.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=767ea464ae49c533ac1f695e97c0614c7bcdd0ca Me while watching this\\*: Taking notes of the scars on his torso for medical research\\* Unfortunately, while he manages to wake up, Suigehas gone blind, and he won\'t recover his sight. This shatters Yixiao. (My heart broke a little when she covered her mouth to hide her sobbing from Suige.) https://i.redd.it/dbytwggdm2vf1.gif Suige tries to comfort her by saying it\'s all right, he\'ll adapt. Yixiao, unlike Suige, isn\'t happy to ""settle"" with his blindness and demands/beg they heal him. (But secretly, Suige is frustrated and hugely upset with his condition as he had all this revenge thing to do. Suige, see what you did - you shouldn\'t have said the vengeance was over in episode 28. You\'ve jinxed it and now we\'re in this fix :P ) Later, to make things worse, Elder Zhou later tells Yixiao that there\'s a blood clot in his brain that could kill him. (He really cannot catch a break can he, Suige?) But fortunately there\'s a cure. 👇 https://preview.redd.it/7c8us1kum2vf1.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03fd39188dd49d78b886da055dfa5dee9daf9b3b Well, hello ~~Sa Dingding~~ Lady An (though she\'s called ""Auntie An"" in Chinese), a woman Dr. Ling fears more than life. (Theory: She\'s his ex.) Her name may mean ""peace"" but she brings anything but that! # The palace people are still scheming against each other Oof, what a nasty world. Murong Sr is urging Murong Yao to strengthen his position. The empress is telling Chenyang to distance himself from the Murongs eventually now that he\'s emperor. None of the kids look happy about their new lives. I have ZERO sympathy for Murong Yao, but poor Chenyang, he is so out of his depth as emperor. He\'s going to be **eaten alive.** (But is he having doubts about the tale the empress is telling him about Suige\'s treachery?) https://preview.redd.it/dsknk0bwp2vf1.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb78fab0956ace27c29ef8cbaa66564408c541c0 Look at the parents, living their dreams and ambitions through their kids. Story as old as time. # The price of healing I wonder if Suige briefly wondered that he could just settle in the Alliance with Yi Xiao and forget the world outside? After all the world thinks that he is dead, and no one will miss him (sobs). However, Suige is too honourable a person for this. Although he broke off things with his dad, I do know he will be driven to avenge him, and he still cares for his siblings who are caught in this messed up web. Also, just because he forgets them, doesn\'t mean that the Murongs will ever stop hunting for him. Him being blind is a huge liability not just to him but to Yi Xiao, whom he never wants to put in danger. So in the end, I felt that his logic to go forward with the procedure made sense. On top of that, all the men had died for him!! Retreating into a quiet life is effectively turning his back on them. So the procedure was inevitable. And I find it interesting that Yixiao is egging him on to take it (I think it\'s her way of trying to save his life, even though I\'m sure she doesn\'t want to lose the person who fell in love with her. She decided to put his desires before hers, basically.) But so heartbreaking that Suige said, if I turn into that ruthless Killer God of Susha again, please don\'t leave me in disappointment 🥲 https://reddit.com/link/1o6f37g/video/1vptizshq2vf1/player (BRB Going off to cry into a pillow) I like that he didn\'t do the classic noble idiot move of pushing her away! Instead he expressed his anxiety about losing her love. As she waits for Suige to reawaken, she stares at the former patient of Auntie An who continues to stare blankly at the sky. # Oh noes https://i.redd.it/m12to0k4r2vf1.gif Well, I guess it didn\'t go well. 🫠 Suige promptly passes out after his fit. Poor guy. Boy did the Murongs do a number on him. Unfortunately their deaths are probably going to swift. Prolonging the timeline of their suffering doesn\'t seem like a bad idea now. [I have to admire how handsome he looks eventhough he passed out from the mother of migraines ;P](https://preview.redd.it/fmxqvo1ls2vf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af00c3089a41898dfa9b82984a84bd9c0e26d56f) So, our couple doesn\'t have matching T-shirts. They have matching MISERIES. ✅ Shoulder bites ✅ Arrow wound on the shoulder ✅ Betrayed by loved ones ✅ Led by f-ed up people And now ✅ AMNESIA Never say they don\'t understand each other\'s problems 🤣. Hey it\'s the foundation of a solid marriage Anyhoo, when I first heard that amneisa was coming, I was like https://i.redd.it/f2brgeh1i2vf1.gif But sometimes, really, I am partial to amnesias. I find them amusing. It entertains the stand up comedian that is my brain. Oh man does my 🧠 go full on with the quips when amnesia strikes. But amnesia executed poorly is EXCRUCIATING. And one way is to drag it out for 10000 years. It\'s just that most of the time amnesia is done badly and they do it drag things out and add more drama. That said, I want to say I saw some spoilers that &gt;!the amnesia will last just an episode and memory returns in episode 31!&lt; Now, was it even necessary? Well, remember when Suige said what a blessing it is to forget the past? That way you can forget all the terrible things. Honestly, after the hell he\'s been through, including being brutally stabbed by someone he considers his true father figure, it is in a way, a relief and will give him space to process things. And thus the episode ends ... while we wait another 24 hours for more episodes. (Melts into a puddle) These episodes weren\'t as intense as the previous batch but still as angsty. Poor Suige. Fate has out it for him. # Previews of episodes 31-32 Damn it &gt;!Elder Zhou! I thought you were a good guy! Is there one person who doesn\'t want to betray Suige? Also, I\'m pretty sure by ep 32 Suige is back to his old self.!&lt; # Questions to ponder 1. Did you think the amnesia arc was necessary? 2. Are you for/against the emperor/Xiyang arc? 3. What do you think Jingshi is up to or are you checking out like I am? :P 4. Yixiao pressures Suige to undergo the memory-altering procedure to save his life. Was she right to do so, even if it risks changing the man she fell in love with? 5. With the reveal of her backstory, has your understanding of Qingyu\'s character and her taking away her children from the palace changed?']"

Nearly five months following the conclusion of the show and the announcement of the winning members, there have been zero preparations made for the group’s debut. This includes **The Kingdom** members Arthur and Ivan, who have even returned back to Korea to begin promotions with The Kingdom again, rather than prepare for their re-debut with the project group. A member of the production company behind *Be The Next: 9 Dreamers*, **Artsro**, told YTN that it would be difficult for the group to debut and expressed their regret at the situation at hand. YTN further clarified that the financial issues also affected the celebrity cast members of the show, who have not been paid their appearance fees. Some of the celebrity mentors included **Sandara Park**, **EXO**‘s **Chen**, **Bang Yedam**, **MOMOLAND**‘s **Hyebin**, and **AB6IX**‘s **Park Woojin**. While YTN stated that some people did get paid, they stated that the majority received no pay or only a portion of what they were guaranteed. While the exact amount was not stated, the total amount of missing payments adds up to hundreds of millions of won. Due to this, Sandara Park’s agency, **ABYSS Company**, has begun legal action by filing for a seizure of Artsro’s property to recover the missing payments. While the production of the show was jointly held by **MLD Entertainment** and Artsro, Artsro was in charge of paying out the appearance fees. They have told YTN that they are in the process of paying out the cast members little by little. [\\[SOURCE\\]](https://star.ytn.co.kr/_sn/0117_202510021517230330)']"

Hi all, I’m trying to find a very obscure anime short (likely one-episode / independent upload) from roughly **2013-2019** (possibly a bit earlier). Here’s everything I remember: * The title was English, likely following the format: **“The story of \\[Japanese-sounding name\\] and \\[Japanese-sounding name\\]”** (e.g., *The story of Kai and Ryu*, though I might mis-remember the exact names). * Runtime: around **30 to 60 minutes** (maybe \\~45 min) — full anime style, not just a 5-minute clip. * Visual style: early-2000s shōnen-anime vibe (think Naruto, Dragon Ball Z style animation) — Japanese animation, likely dubbed or with English subtitles. * Plot: Two true brothers. One of the brothers enters a forest and meets a demon/goblin/evil figure. * That evil figure says something along the lines of **“give up your hope in exchange for power”**. * The brother who accepts becomes evil, gains a special eye (a mark or eye power) and turns against his brother. * The good brother has to confront (and I *think* kill) the corrupted brother in the end. * I **believe** the thumbnail or promo image had one of the brothers (either the good or evil one) prominently shown (maybe with the special eye). * I recall the name of one of them *might* end in “-kyu” (or something like Kyu/-kyū), but I am only about 10% sure. The names are definitely Japanese-style sounding. * It was uploaded on YouTube (or at least I watched it on YouTube) as a standalone video (not part of a long series). * The title was simple and straightforward, not a huge franchise name.

It was more grounded and realistic looking Specific things I remember The main girl’s powers awakened in the middle of the night. As she was going to the bathroom she touched and bent electronics in the house (I think it was a vcr). Girls powers were physical strength. Do not remember her having psychic abilities. Later in the movie they that she went through some kind of transformation, got more mature body that was mascular. She also had shorter brown/dark hair There was also this particular scene where at some point of the story she and her friends where hiding in the elevator shaft. The girl was holding couple of her friends on her back while spread out touching walls with her hand and feet and I think she was semi nude although it was not explicit. I remember shirt was getting tight/ripping on her. She also had a black friend who had kind of shorter dreadlocks. His power was absorbing material properties and becoming that material if he was touching it. At some point he ended up in water and was shooting water out of his hands during the main fight There was also one of the bed guys who was training in a dojo while talking on the phone/video call with another antagonist who was female.
