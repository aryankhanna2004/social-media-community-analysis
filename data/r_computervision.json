Back in 2019, I tackled symbol recognition using OpenCV. It worked reasonably well but struggled when symbols were partially obscured. Now, seven years later, I'm revisiting this challenge.\n\nI've done research but haven't found a popular library specifically for symbol recognition or template matching. With OpenCV template matching you can just hand a PNG symbol and it’ll try to match instances in the drawing to it. Is there any model that can do similar? These symbols are super basic in shape but the issue is overlapping elements.\n\nI've looked into vision-language models like QWEN 2.5, but I'm not clear on how to apply them to this use case. I've also seen references to YOLOv9, SAM2, CLIP, and DINOv2 for segmentation tasks, but it seems like these would require creating a training dataset and significant compute resources for each symbol.\n\nIs that really the case? Do I actually need to create a custom dataset and fine-tune a model just to find symbols in SVG documents, or are there more straightforward approaches available? Worst case I can do this, it’s just not very scalable given our symbols change frequently.\n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated!",

    "content": "I’m developing a **visual anomaly detection system** for **cables** roughly the size of a **pen** in circumference. The goal is to detect **defects at the cable head** — things like scratches, deformities, or small misalignments. During data collection and inference, multiple cameras (probably 2-3 from different angles) will capture high-quality images of cable heads. The images will be used to train an **unsupervised anomaly detection model** (e.g., autoencoder-based). I need **very clear, consistent lighting and image sharpness** because tiny surface defects matter.\n\n  \nDuring Deployment, the camera will continuously capture new cable head images. These images will be sent to a **GPU server** running the trained model. The server will output a defect score or anomaly mask. That signal will be sent to **two robot arms** that perform the sorting/filtering operation ( I am not concerned about this step as it is not my part).  \nI’ve **never worked directly with industrial cameras** or imaging hardware before.  \nSo right now, I’m trying to figure out what **camera hardware and setup details** I need to get right early on to avoid bottlenecks later.\n\n  \nWhat I think I need:  \n**Resolution:** it should be enough to capture fine surface details on small cable heads ( roughly 1-2 cm diameter).  \n**Lens Type:** Should I go with **macro lenses** or just high-resolution lenses with adjustable focus? I’ll probably mount the cameras very close to the object (a few centimeters away).  \n**Camera Interface:** USB3, GigE, or something else? I’ll send images to a **GPU server** — is bandwidth going to be a problem if I scale to multiple cameras?\n\nIf you’ve worked on **visual inspection** systems — especially small-object or manufacturing defect detection — I’d love to hear what to watch out for, what mistakes to avoid, and what specific camera brands/setups worked best for you.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

[Link](https://farukalamai.substack.com/p/rf-detr-vs-yolov12-a-comprehensive) \n\nIn this tutorial I showed how you do inference with these models. I showed how you can fine-tune one on a synthetic dataset. And how you can visualize some of these results.\n\nI am thinking about just adding some more things to this notebook, maybe batch inference or just comparing how much vram/compute both of these models use. What do you guys think?\n\n[Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/koenbotermans/computer-vision-rf-detr-vs-yolov11)\n\nEdit: added the correct link",

    "content": "VLA-R1 is a new model that helps AI systems reason better when connecting vision, language, and actions. Most existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models just look at an image, read a command, and act without really explaining how they make decisions. They often ignore physical limits, like what actions are possible with an object, and rely too much on simple fine-tuning after training. VLA-R1 changes that by teaching the model to think step by step using a process called Chain-of-Thought supervision. It’s trained on a new dataset with 13,000 examples that show detailed reasoning connected to how objects can be used and how movements should look. After that, it goes through a reinforcement learning phase that rewards it for accurate actions, realistic movement paths, and well-structured answers. A new optimization method called Group Relative Policy Optimization also helps it learn more efficiently. As a result, VLA-R1 performs better both in familiar environments and in completely new ones, showing strong results in simulations and on real robots. The team plans to release the model, dataset, and code to help others build smarter and more reliable AI systems.\n\nPaper link: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01623](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01623)  \nCode sample: [https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1?utm\\_source=catalyzex.com](https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1?utm_source=catalyzex.com)",

    "content": "**Context:** I'm working on a project to estimate distances between workers and vehicles, or between workers and lifted loads, to identify when workers enter dangerous zones. The distances need to be in real-world units (cm or m).\n\nThe camera is positioned at a fairly high angle relative to the ground plane, but not high enough to achieve a true bird's-eye view.\n\n**Current Approach:** I'm currently using the average height of a person as a known reference object to convert pixels to meters. I calculate distances using 2D Euclidean distance (x, y) in the image plane, ignoring the Z-axis. I understand this approach is only robust when the camera has a top-down view of the area.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n1. **Homography limitations:** I cannot manually select a reference plane because the ground is highly variable with uneven surfaces, especially in areas where workers are unloading materials. \n2. **Depth estimation integration(Depth anything v2):** I've considered incorporating depth estimation to obtain Z-axis information and calculate 3D Euclidean distances. However, I'm unsure how to convert these measurements to real-world units, since x and y are in pixels while z is normalized (0-1 range).\n\n  \n**Limitation: For now, I only have access to a single camera**\n\n**Question:** Are there alternative methods or approaches that would work better for this scenario, given the current challenges and limitations?\n\n",

    "content": "The LAKAN model (Landmark-Assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) introduces a new way to detect face forgeries, such as deepfakes, by combining facial landmark information with a more flexible neural network structure. Unlike traditional deepfake detection models that often rely on fixed activation functions and struggle with subtle manipulation details, LAKAN uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which allow the activation functions to be learned and adapted during training. This makes the model better at recognizing complex and non-linear patterns that occur in fake images or videos. By integrating facial landmarks, LAKAN can focus more precisely on important regions of the face and adapt its parameters to different expressions or poses. Tests on multiple public datasets show that LAKAN outperforms many existing models, especially when detecting forgeries it hasn’t seen before. Overall, LAKAN offers a promising step toward more accurate and adaptable deepfake detection systems that can generalize better across different manipulation types and data sources. \n\nPaper link: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00634](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00634)",

I feel like I have a strong set of technical skills ready to deploy, but I'm finding it difficult to pinpoint a specific, real-world problem that a business would genuinely pay to have solved. I'm very confident in the \"how,\" but I'm realizing the \"what\" is a completely different skill set.\n\n\n\nFor the engineers here who have successfully made that jump into entrepreneurship, how did you discover your first business idea? What was your process for finding that initial problem to solve? Did you start by reaching out directly to potential clients?\n\n\n\nI'm feeling a bit stuck on how to begin searching for a problem from the outside.

    "title": "From shaky phone footage to 3D worlds (discussion of a research paper)",
    "content": "A team from Google DeepMind used videos taken with their phones for 3D reconstruction — a breakthrough that won the Best Paper Honorable Mention at CVPR 2025.\n\nFull reference : Li, Zhengqi, et al. “[MegaSaM: Accurate, fast and robust structure and motion from casual dynamic videos.](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/papers/Li_MegaSaM_Accurate_Fast_and_Robust_Structure_and_Motion_from_Casual_CVPR_2025_paper.pdf)” *Proceedings of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference*. 2025.\n\n# Context\n\nWhen we take a video with our phone, we capture not only moving objects but also subtle shifts in how the camera itself moves. Figuring out the path of the camera and the shape of the scene from such everyday videos is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. Traditional methods work well when the camera moves a lot and the scene stays still. But they often break down with hand-held videos where the camera barely moves, rotates in place, or where people and objects are moving around.\n\n# Key results\n\nThe new system is called *MegaSaM* and it allows computers to accurately and quickly recover both the camera’s path and the 3D structure of a scene, even when the video is messy and full of movement. In essence, *MegaSaM* builds on the idea of *Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping* (SLAM). The idea of the process if to figure out “Where am I?” (camera position) and “What does the world look like?” (scene shape) from video. Earlier SLAM methods had two problems: they either struggled with shaky or limited motion, or suffered from moving people and objects. *MegaSaM* improves upon them with three key innovations:\n\n1. **Filtering out moving objects:** The system learns to identify which parts of the video belong to moving things and diminishes their effect. This prevents confusion between object motion and camera motion.\n2. **Smarter depth starting point:** Instead of starting from scratch, *MegaSaM* uses existing single-image depth estimators as a guide, giving it a head start in understanding the scene’s shape.\n3. **Uncertainty awareness:** Sometimes, a video simply doesn’t give enough information to confidently figure out depth or camera settings (for example, when the camera barely moves). *MegaSaM* knows when it’s uncertain and uses depth hints more heavily in those cases. This makes it more robust to difficult footage.\n\nIn experiments, *MegaSaM* was tested on a wide range of datasets: animated movies, controlled lab videos, and handheld footage. The approach outperformed other state-of-the-art methods, producing more accurate camera paths and more consistent depth maps while running at competitive speeds. Unlike many recent systems, *MegaSaM* does not require slow fine-tuning for each video. It works directly, making it faster and more practical.\n\nThe Authors also examined how different parts of their design mattered. Removing the moving-object filter, for example, caused errors when people walked in front of the camera. Without the uncertainty-aware strategy, performance dropped in tricky scenarios with little camera movement. These tests confirmed that each piece of *MegaSaM*’s design was crucial.\n\nThe system isn’t perfect: it can still fail when the entire frame is filled with motion, or when the camera’s lens changes zoom during the video. Nevertheless, it represents a major step forward. By combining insights from older SLAM methods with modern deep learning, *MegaSaM* brings us closer to a future where casual videos can be reliably turned into 3D maps. This could help with virtual reality, robotics, filmmaking, and even personal memories. Imagine *re-living* the first steps of your kids in 3D — how cool would *that* be!\n\n# My take\n\nI think *MegaSaM* is an important and practical step for making 3D understanding work better on normal videos people record every day. The system builds on modern SLAM methods, like [DROID-SLAM](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/89fcd07f20b6785b92134bd6c1d0fa42-Paper.pdf), but it improves them in a smart and realistic way. It adds a way to find moving objects, to use good single-image depth models, and to check how sure it is about the results. These ideas help the system avoid common mistakes when the scene moves or the camera does not move much. The results are clearly stronger than older methods such as [CasualSAM](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2022/papers_ECCV/papers/136930020.pdf) or [MonST3R](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03825). The fact that the Authors share their code and data is also very good for research. In my opinion, *MegaSaM* can be useful for many applications, like creating 3D scenes from phone videos, making AR and VR content, or supporting visual effects.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI wanted to share one of my recent AI projects that turned into a real-world product, [HairCounting.com](https://haircounting.com).\n\nIt is an AI-powered analysis system that processes microscopic scalp images and automatically counts and maps hair follicles. Dermatologists and trichologists use it to measure hair density and monitor hair-loss treatments without doing the manual work.\n\n# How it works\n\nThe pipeline is built around a YOLO-based detection model trained on thousands of annotated scalp images.  \nThe process:\n\n1. Image preprocessing: color normalization, noise removal, and scale calibration\n2. Detection and segmentation: the model identifies each visible hair shaft and follicle\n3. Post-processing: removes duplicates, merges close detections, and calculates density per cm²\n4. Visualization and report generation: builds a visual map and returns counts and thickness data via API\n\nI trained the model to reach around 70%+ precision, which was actually a real medical requirement from one of the clinics. Total perfection is not needed, doctors mainly need consistent automated measurements.\n\n# Stack and integration\n\n* Frameworks: PyTorch and OpenCV\n* API backend: Laravel 11 with Sanctum authentication\n* Deployment: Nginx on Ubuntu (GPU optional)\n\n# Challenges I faced\n\n* Managing image scale calibration across different microscopes\n* Detecting extremely fine or gray hairs under varying light\n* Creating a balanced dataset for both dense and sparse hair regions\n* Returning structured JSON output fast enough for clinical software\n\n# Why I am sharing this\n\nI thought it would be useful to showcase how computer vision can be applied to a very niche but impactful problem.  \nIf anyone here is building custom AI for medical, beauty, or visual measurement use cases, I would love to compare approaches or exchange feedback.\n\nYou can test the live demo or read the technical overview here: [https://haircounting.com/](https://haircounting.com/)",

I recently built **BrandRefinement**, an open-source AI pipeline that helps create high-quality brand advertising images.\n\nThe Problem: When using AI to generate product placement in creative scenes, the generated products often have small inconsistencies - wrong logos, slightly off colors, or distorted details that don't match the actual brand product.\n\n**The Solution**: A 3-stage pipeline:\n\n**1. Generate** \\- Combine your creative background (character, scene) with a brand product reference  \n**2. Draw Masks** \\- Mark which parts need refinement  \n**3. Refine** \\- AI precisely adjusts the generated product to match the original brand specifications\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n\\- **Input**: Astronaut cow character + Heineken bottle reference  \n\\- **Output**: Professional advertising image with accurate product details\n\nThe tool uses DreamO for initial generation and a custom refinement pipeline to ensure brand consistency.\n\nCheck it out: [*https://github.com/DinhLuan14/BrandRefinement*](https://github.com/DinhLuan14/BrandRefinement)\n\nWould love to hear your feedback or see what you create with i",

It feels like a meth lab of “semi-datasets” rather than something you can actually train from.\n\nAt this point, I think what the community needs more than faster YOLO versions is better shared datasets, clean, well-labeled, and covering practical use cases. The models are already fast and capable; data quality is what’s holding things back.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on pretrained YOLO models. YOLO has become *the* go-to for object detection, yet somehow it’s still painful to find proper pretrained weights for specific applications beyond COCO.

    "content": "If you’re into computer vision, 3D scene reconstruction, or SLAM research, you should definitely check out the new paper “MegaSaM”. It introduces a system capable of extracting highly accurate and robust camera parameters and depth maps from ordinary monocular videos, even in challenging dynamic and low-parallax scenes. Traditional methods tend to fail in such real-world conditions since they rely heavily on static environments and large parallax, but MegaSaM overcomes these limitations by combining deep visual SLAM with neural network-based depth estimation. The system uses a differentiable bundle adjustment layer supported by single-frame depth predictions and object motion estimation, along with an uncertainty-aware global optimization that improves reliability and pose stability. Tested on both synthetic and real-world datasets, MegaSaM achieves remarkable gains in accuracy, speed, and robustness compared to previous methods. It’s a great read for anyone working on visual SLAM, geometric vision, or neural 3D perception.

    "content": "I just came across a fantastic research paper that was selected as one of the top 2 papers in the field of Computer Vision in 2025 and it’s absolutely worth a read. The topic is a next-generation LiDAR system enhanced with neural networks. This work uses time-resolved flash LiDAR data, capturing light from multiple angles and time intervals. What’s groundbreaking is that it models not only direct reflections but also indirect reflected and scattered light paths. Using a neural-network-based approach called Neural Radiance Cache, the system precisely computes both the incoming and outgoing light rays for every point in the scene, including their temporal and directional information. This allows for a physically consistent reconstruction of both the scene geometry and its material properties. The result is a much more accurate 3D reconstruction that captures complex light interactions, something traditional LiDARs often miss. In practice, this could mean huge improvements in autonomous driving, augmented reality, and remote sensing, providing unmatched realism and precision. Unfortunately, the code hasn’t been released yet, so I couldn’t test it myself, but it’s only a matter of time before we see commercial implementations of systems like this.\n\n  \n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05347](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05347)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/po57jm0d64vf1.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53ee1e6a133ef5dafccdaa4e1ddecbc552b570ff",

PSI, for example, uses a probabilistic autoregressive model trained on large-scale video data and applies causal probing to extract and reintegrate those structures into training.\n\nFor practitioners in computer vision, this signals a shift from static-image pretraining toward dynamic, structure-aware representations - potentially relevant for motion understanding, robotics, and embodied perception.\n\nFull piece: [Turing Post – “World Models You Should Know”](https://www.turingpost.com/p/cwm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

I graduated in December 2023. My dissertation involved modern C++, Python and numerical algorithms for partial differential equations in CFD. After deciding to get out of academia, I went back to my home town in Colombia, where I did whatever industry job my technical skills could get me.\n\nAfter a boring 6-month job as a data scientist at a bank, I landed an R&amp;D job where, among other duties, I trained my first CNNs for a somewhat challenging detection problem. After almost a year in that job, last month I moved back to the US following a great career shift my American spouse was offered. Now, again, I'm currently trying to find a job.\n\nAfter my last job I got very interested in computer vision, deep learning, and even more specific stuff like nerfs. I know the basics of CV, DL, and of course I have a strong math, physics, and numerical computing background from school.\n\nHere's my question to experienced CV engineers in this sub: what would you advice a scientist with my background in order to break into this field and land a job? Is there any concrete way in which I can use my background to land a job in this current market?\n\nThank you for your honest reply!",

I'd love to hear some **honest feedback and thoughts** from the community!\n\nWe’ve developed a collection of **optimized computer vision** pre-trained models, available on **MIT license**, based on:\n\n* **RTDetr** for object detection\n* **MaskFormer &amp; BisenetFormer** for semantic and instance segmentation\n* **RTMO** for keypoints estimation \n* **STDC** for classification\n\nThe **Python SDK** ([GitHub](https://github.com/FocoosAI/focoos)) allows you to use, train, export pre-trained and custom models. All our models are exportable with optimized engines, such as **ONNX with TensorRT** support or TorchScript, for high performance inference.\n\nOur **web platform** ([app.focoos.ai](https://app.focoos.ai)) provides a **no-code** environment that allows users to leverage our pre-trained models, import their own datasets or use public ones to train new models, monitor training progress, compare different runs and deploy models seamlessly in the cloud or on-premises.\n\nIn this early stage we offer a **generous free tier**: 10hr of T4 cloud training, 5GB of storage and 1000 cloud inferences.\n\nThe SDK and the platform are designed to **work seamlessly together**. For instance, you can train a model locally while tracking metrics online just like wandb. You can also use a remote dataset for local training, or perform local inference with models trained on the platform.\n\nWe’re aiming for high performance and simplicity: faster inference, lower compute cost, and a smoother experience.\n\nIf you’re into computer vision and want to try a new workflow, we’d really appreciate your thoughts:\n\n* How does it compare to your current setup?\n* Any blockers, missing features, or ideas for improvement?\n\nWe’re still early and actively improving things, **so your feedback really helps us build something valuable for the community**.",

    "content": "Im starting work on my Bachelor Thesis and my subject will be pose estimation on Medieval Manuscripts, right now im drafting the actual research question with my supervisor and so far the plan is roughly to use a model like OpenPose on the dataset and then evaluate the results for poses, hand gestures etc.\n\nBut as we were talking about the evaluation of the poses, we sort of ran out of ideas for a quality focused evaluation.\n\nFirst off, the data set I'll be using doesn't have any pose estimation focused annotations, so no keypoints or bounding boxes for people. It has some basic annotations about the bible scene it depicts and also about saints etc., but nothing that could really be used for evaluating the poses themselves.  The dataset has around 12k images, so labeling it all by hand is out of the question.\n\nOur first idea is to use a segmentation/object detection model to find as many people as possible on the pages and then generate crops based on the output before then using for example OpenPose for pose recognition on these crops. But suppose all of these crops were perfect and would only depict one person, how could we validate the correctness of a pose without checking manually?\n\nMy idea was to use a measurement based on joint angles, basically ruling out impossible situations that imply abnormally twisted joints in actual humans. But so far none of us were not able to find any papers using a similar approach, which would be very helpful, since proposing an evaluation like this is quite hard to do correctly and according to scientific standard. So I was wondering if anyone here might know an already tried approach for something like this or can maybe recommend a paper.\n\nBesides that we were also talking about a quantitative evaluation, where we would use a ratio of expected keypoints vs actually detected keypoints as a 2nd measure of correctness. But this of course will have its own issues since in reality not all of our crops will contain exactly one person or a person who has all of their joints/limbs in a visible position.  Are there any other measures we could try, given that there are no proper annotations for this dataset?\n\nEdit: here's an example [https://imgur.com/a/fPkxb6m](https://imgur.com/a/fPkxb6m)",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m planning a project where a camera detects a white sheet of paper on a desk, and a robotic arm automatically moves a small lamp so that the light always stays focused on the paper.\n\nHere’s the idea:\n\t•\tA Pi Camera captures live video.\n\t•\tOpenCV runs on the Raspberry Pi to detect the white area (the paper) and track its position.\n\t•\tA PCA9685 servo driver (connected via I²C) generates PWM signals to control several servo motors that move the arm.\n\t•\tThe system continuously tracks the paper’s movement in real time and adjusts the lamp accordingly.\n\nI originally planned to use a Raspberry Pi 4, but I’m wondering if the Pi Zero 2W would be powerful enough to handle the camera input and basic OpenCV tracking (grayscale conversion, thresholding, contour detection, centroid calculation) while communicating with the PCA9685 over I²C.\n\nHas anyone tried a similar vision-based tracking project on a Pi Zero 2W?\nAny tips, performance insights, or examples would be greatly appreciated — or if you’ve done something similar, I’d love to hear about your experience!\n\nThanks a lot 🙌\n",

    "title": "What IDE to use for computer vision working with Python.",
    "content": "Hello everyone. I'm working on computer vision for my research and I'm tired of all the IDEs around. It is true that I have some constraints with each of the IDEs but I cant find a solution for prototyping with respect to working with image projects.\n\nSome background as to my constraints: I'm using Linux because of overall ease of use, and access to software. I don't want to use terminal based IDEs since image rendering is not direct in the terminal. I also would like the IDEs to be easily configurable so that I can implement the changes as per my need. \n\n- I use Jupyter notebook and I don't think I'll stop using it anytime but it's very difficult to prototype in jupyter notebook. I use it to test others' notebooks and create a final output for showcase but it's not fast enough for trial and error. \n\n- I really caught up with using Spyder as an IDE but it tends to crash a lot, with and without running it in a virtual environment. It also doesn't seem right to run an IDE in a virtual environment. I also can't easily run plug-ins such as vim plugin in spyder and it crashes a lot. The feature to run only selected parts of the code as well as the variable explorer feature is phenomenal but I hate that it crashes from time to time. Tried installing via conda forge, conda, through arch repository but to no avail. \n\n- I like emacs as an IDE but I find trouble with running images in line. The output plots and images tend to pop up outside emacs and not in line unless I use the EIN package. Also I don't know of any features like the variable explorer or separate window where all the plots are saved. \n\n- I tried pycharm but as of now I've not tried it enough to enjoy it. The plugin management is also a bit clanky afaik but it's seamless integrating plugin in emacs. \n\n- (edit:) I don't prefer using vscode due to the closed nature and the non intuitive method of customising the IDE. I know it's more of a philosophical reason but I believe it is a hindrance to the flexibility of the development environment. Also I know that Libre alternatives are there for vscode but since I can't tinker with it using literate programming minimally, I don't prefer using it, unless absolutely necessary. Let's say it's less hackable and demanding on resources. \n\nSo I would like your views and opinions on the setups and toolings used for your needs.\n\nAlso there's the python dependency hell as well as the virtual environment issue. So although this is a frequently asked question, I would like your opinions on that too as well. My first priority is minimalism over simplicity, and simplicity over abstraction. ",

They break on real-world documents: handwritten annotations on printed text, multi-column layouts with complex reading order, degraded scans from 20+ year old documents, mixed-language documents with script switching, documents photographed at angles with perspective distortion, low-contrast text on textured backgrounds, and complex tables with merged cells and nested structures.\n\nWe needed a system robust enough to handle all of this while maintaining 99.9% accuracy.\n\n**Our Approach:**\n\nWe built a multi-stage pipeline combining classical CV techniques with modern deep learning:\n\n**Stage 1: Document Analysis &amp; Preprocessing** \n\nPerspective correction using homography estimation, adaptive binarization accounting for uneven lighting and background noise, layout analysis with region detection (text blocks, tables, images, equations), reading order determination for complex multi-column layouts, and skew correction and dewarping for photographed documents.\n\n**Stage 2: Text Detection &amp; Recognition** \n\nCustom-trained text detection model based on efficient architecture for document layouts. Character recognition using attention-based sequence models rather than simple classification. Contextual refinement using language models to correct ambiguous characters. Specialized handling for mathematical notation, chemical formulas, and specialized symbols.\n\n**Stage 3: Document Understanding (ScribIQ)** \n\nThis is where it gets interesting. Beyond OCR, we built ScribIQ, a vision-language model that understands document structure and semantics.\n\nIt uses visual features from the CV pipeline combined with extracted text to understand document context. Identifies document type (contract, research paper, financial statement, etc.) from visual and textual cues. Extracts relationships between sections and understands hierarchical structure. Answers natural language queries about document content with spatial awareness of where information appears.\n\nFor example: \"What are the termination clauses?\" - ScribIQ doesn't just keyword search \"termination.\" It understands legal document structure, identifies clause sections, recognizes related provisions across pages, and provides spatially-aware citations.\n\n**Training Data &amp; Accuracy:**\n\nTrained on millions of real-world documents across domains: legal contracts, medical records, financial statements, academic papers, handwritten notes, forms and applications, receipts and invoices, and technical documentation.\n\n99.9% character-level accuracy across document types. 98.7% layout structure accuracy on complex multi-column documents. 97.3% table extraction accuracy maintaining cell relationships. Handles 25+ languages with script-specific optimizations.\n\n**Performance Optimization:**\n\nModel quantization reducing inference time 3x without accuracy loss. Batch processing up to 10 pages simultaneously with parallelized pipeline. GPU optimization with TensorRT for sub-2-second page processing. Adaptive resolution processing based on document quality.\n\n**Real-World Challenges We Solved:**\n\nHandwritten annotations on printed documents, dual model approach detecting and processing each separately. Mixed-orientation pages (landscape tables in portrait documents), rotation detection per region rather than per page. Faded or degraded historical documents, super-resolution preprocessing before OCR. Complex scientific notation and mathematical equations, specialized LaTeX recognition pipeline. Multilingual documents with inline script switching, language detection at word level.\n\n**ScribIQ Architecture:**\n\nVision encoder processing document images at multiple scales. Text encoder handling extracted OCR with positional embeddings. Cross-attention layers fusing visual and textual representations. Question encoder for natural language queries. Decoder generating answers with document-grounded attention.\n\nThe key insight: pure text-based document QA loses spatial information. ScribIQ maintains awareness of visual layout, enabling questions like \"What's in the table on page 3?\" or \"What does the highlighted section say?\"\n\n**What's Coming Next - Enterprise Scale:**\n\nWe're launching Inkscribe Enterprise with capabilities that push the CV system further:\n\nBatch processing 1000+ pages simultaneously with distributed inference across GPU clusters. Custom model fine-tuning on client-specific document types and terminology. Real-time processing pipelines with sub-100ms latency for high-throughput applications. Advanced table understanding with complex nested structure extraction. Handwriting recognition fine-tuned for specific handwriting styles. Multi-modal understanding combining text, images, charts, and diagrams. Form understanding with automatic field detection and value extraction.\n\n**Technical Stack:**\n\nPyTorch for model development and training. ONNX Runtime and TensorRT for optimized inference. OpenCV for classical CV preprocessing. Custom CUDA kernels for performance-critical operations. Distributed training with DDP across multiple GPUs. Model versioning and A/B testing infrastructure.\n\n**Open Questions for the CV Community:**\n\nHow do you handle reading order in extremely complex layouts (academic papers with side notes, figures, and multi-column text)? What's your approach to mixed-quality document processing where quality varies page-by-page? For document QA systems, how do you maintain visual grounding while using transformer architectures? What evaluation metrics do you use beyond character accuracy for document understanding tasks?\n\n**Available for Testing:**\n\nWeb: [https://inkscribe.ai/](https://inkscribe.ai/)\n\niOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inkscribe-ai/id6744860905](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inkscribe-ai/id6744860905)\n\nAndroid: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.inkscribe.app.twa&amp;pcampaignid=web\\_share](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.inkscribe.app.twa&amp;pcampaignid=web_share)\n\nCommunity: [https://www.reddit.com/r/InkscribeAI/](https://www.reddit.com/r/InkscribeAI/)\n\n**For Researchers &amp; Engineers:**\n\nInterested in discussing architecture decisions, training approaches, or optimization techniques? I'm happy to go deeper on any aspect of the system. Also looking for challenging documents that break current systems, if you have edge cases, send them my way and I'll share how our pipeline handles them.\n\n**Current Limitations &amp; Improvements:**\n\nWorking on better handling of dense mathematical notation (95% accuracy, targeting 99%). Improving layout analysis on artistic or highly stylized documents. Optimizing memory usage for very high-resolution scans (current limit \\~600 DPI). Expanding language support beyond current 25 languages.\n\n**Benchmarks:**\n\nOpen to running our system against standard benchmarks if there's interest. Currently tracking internal metrics, but happy to evaluate on public datasets for comparison.\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\n\nDocument understanding is fundamentally a computer vision problem, not just OCR. Understanding requires spatial awareness, layout comprehension, and multi-modal reasoning. We built a system that combines classical CV, modern deep learning, and vision-language models to solve real-world document processing.\n\nTry it, break it, tell me where the CV pipeline fails.

    "title": "Upgrading LiDAR: every light reflection matters",
    "content": "What if the messy, noisy, scattered light that cameras usually ignore actually holds the key to sharper 3D vision? The Authors of the *Best Student Paper Award* ask: can we learn from every bounce of light to see the world more clearly?\n\nFull reference : Malik, Anagh, et al. “[Neural Inverse Rendering from Propagating Light.](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/papers/Malik_Neural_Inverse_Rendering_from_Propagating_Light_CVPR_2025_paper.pdf)” *Proceedings of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference*. 2025.\n\n# Context\n\nDespite the light moving very fast, modern sensors can actually capture its journey as it bounces around a scene. The key tool here is the *flash lidar*, a type of laser camera that emits a quick pulse of light and then measures the tiny delays as it reflects off surfaces and returns to the sensor. By tracking these echoes with extreme precision, flash lidar creates detailed 3D maps of objects and spaces.\n\nNormally, lidar systems only consider the first bounce of light, i.e. the direct reflection from a surface. But in the real world, light rarely stops there. It bounces multiple times, scattering off walls, floors, and shiny objects before reaching the sensor. These additional *indirect* reflections are usually seen as a problem because they make calculations messy and complex. But they also carry additional information about the shapes, materials, and hidden corners of a scene. Until now, this valuable information was usually filtered out.\n\n# Key results\n\nThe Authors developed the first system that doesn’t just capture these complex reflections but actually models them in a physically accurate way. They created a hybrid method that blends physics and machine learning: physics provides rules about how light behaves, while the neural networks handle the complicated details efficiently. Their approach builds a kind of *cache* that stores how light spreads and scatters over time in different directions. Instead of tediously simulating every light path, the system can quickly look up these stored patterns, making the process much faster.\n\nWith this, the Authors can do several impressive things:\n\n* **Reconstruct accurate 3D geometry** even in tricky situations with lots of reflections, such as shiny or cluttered scenes.\n* **Render videos of light propagation** from entirely new viewpoints, as if you had placed your lidar somewhere else.\n* **Separate direct and indirect light** automatically, revealing how much of what we see comes from straight reflection versus multiple bounces.\n* **Relight scenes in new ways**, showing what they would look like under different light sources, even if that lighting wasn’t present during capture.\n\nThe Authors tested their system on both simulated and real-world data, comparing it against existing state-of-the-art methods. Their method consistently produced more accurate geometry and more realistic renderings, especially in scenes dominated by indirect light.\n\nOne slight hitch: the approach is computationally heavy and can take over a day to process on a high-end computer. But its potential applications are vast. It could improve self-driving cars by helping them interpret complex lighting conditions. It could assist in remote sensing of difficult environments. It could even pave the way for seeing around corners. By embracing the “messiness” of indirect light rather than ignoring it, this work takes an important step toward richer and more reliable 3D vision.\n\n# My take\n\nThis paper is an important step in using all the information that lidar sensors can capture, not just the first echo of light. I like this idea because it connects two strong fields — lidar and neural rendering — and makes them work together. Lidar is becoming central to robotics and mapping, and handling indirect reflections could reduce errors in difficult real-world scenes such as large cities or interiors with strong reflections. The only downside is the slow processing, but that’s just a question of time, right? (pun intended)\n\nStepping aside from the technology itself, this invention is another example of how *digging deeper* often yields better results. In my research, I’ve frequently used principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. In simple terms, it’s a method that offers a new perspective on multi-channel data.\n\nConsider, for instance, a collection of audio tracks recorded simultaneously in a studio. PCA combines information from these tracks and “summarises” it into a new set of tracks. The first track captures most of the meaningful information (in this example, sounds), the second contains much less, and so on, until the last one holds little more than random noise. Because the first track retains most of the information, a common approach is to discard the rest (hence the dimensionality reduction).\n\nRecently, however, our team discovered that the *second* track (the second principal component) actually contained information *far more relevant* to the problem we were trying to solve.",

    "title": "Finding a tool to identify the distance between camera and object in a video",
    "content": "Hi guys, I am a university student and my project with professor stuck. Specifically, I have to develop a tool that should be able to identify the 3D coordinate of an object in the video (we focus on video that have one main object only), to do that, I would first have to measure the distance (depth) between the camera and the object. I find the model DepthAnythingv2 could help me to estimate the distance, and I will combines it with the model CoTracker, used for tracking the object during the video.\n\nMy main problem is to create a suitable dataset for the project. I looked for many dataset but could hardly find one that is suitable. KiTTy is quite close to my demand since they provide the 3D coordinator, depth, intrinsic of the camera and everything but they mainly works for transportation and they do not record the video base on the depth.\n\nTo be clearer, my professor said that I should find or create a dataset of about 100 video of, I guess, 10 objects (10 video each object). In the video, I will stand away from the object for 9m and then move closely to the object until the distance is 3m only. My idea now is to establish special marks of the 3m, 4.5m, 6m, 7.5m and 9m distances from the object by drawing a line on the road or attaching a color tape. I will use a depth estimation model (probably DepthAnything) (and I am looking for some other deep learning model also) to estimate the depth from these distance and compare this result to the ground truth of these distance.\n\nI have two main jobs to do now. The first is to find a suitable dataset to match my demand as I mentioned above. From the video recorded, I will cut the 3m, 4,5m, 6m, 7.5m and 9m distance in a video (which is 5 image in a video) to evaluate the performance of the depth estimation model, and I will use that depth estimation model also in every single frame in the video, to see if the distance estimated decrease continuously (as I move closer to the object), which is good, or it fluctuates, which is bad and unstable. But I gonna work on this problem later after I have established an appropriate dataset which is also my second and my priority job right now.\n\nWorking on that task, I don't know is that the most appropriate approach to help me evaluate the performance of the depth estimation model and it is kinda waste as I can only compare 5 distance in the whole video. Therefore, I am looking for some measurement tool or app that maybe could measure the depth throughout the video (like the tape measure I guess) so that I could label and use every single frame in the video. Can you guys recommend me some ideas to create the suitable dataset for my problems or maybe a tool/ app/ kit that could help me to identify the distance from the camera to the object in the video? I will attach my phone to my chest so we can cound the distance from the camera to the object as from me to the object.\n\nP/s: I am sorry for the long post and my Engligh, it might be difficult for me to express my idea and for you to read my problem. If there are any confusing information, please tell me so I can explain.\n\nP/s 2: I have attached an example of what I am working in my project. I will have an object in the video, which is a person in this example, and I would have to estimate the distance between the person and the camera, which is me standing 6m away using my phone to record. In another words, I have to estimate the distance between that person (the object) to the phone (or camera).\n\n[An example of my dataset](https://preview.redd.it/g1t5hi0nsduf1.jpg?width=339&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e60d90f78ba8931eb788be6d788244b9a70ded4)",

    "content": "Greetings,\n\nWe are a small team of 6 people that work on a startup project in our free time (mainly computer vision + some algorithms etc.). So far, we have been using the roboflow platform for labelling, training models etc. However, this is very costly and we cannot justify 60 bucks / month for labelling and limited credits for model training with limited flexibility.\n\n  \nWe are looking to see where it is worthwhile to migrate to, without needing too much time to do so and without it being too costly.\n\n  \nCurrently, this is our situation: \n\n\\- We have a small grant of 500 euros that we can utilize. Aside from that we can also spend from our own money if it's justified. The project produces no revenue yet, we are going to have a demo within this month to see the interest of people and from there see how much time and money we will invest moving forward. In any case we want to have a migration from roboflow set-up to not have delays.\n\n\\- We have setup an S3 bucket where we keep our datasets (so far approx. 40GB space) which are constantly growing since we are also doing data collection. We also are renting a VPS where we are hosting CVAT for labelling. These come around 4-7 euros / month. We have set up some basic repositories for drawing data, some basic training workflows which we are trying to figure out, mainly revolving around YOLO, RF-DETR, object detection and segmentation models, some timeseries forecasting, trackers etc. We are playing around with different frameworks so we want to be a bit flexible.\n\n\\- We are looking into renting VMs and just using our repos to train models but we also want some easy way to compare runs etc. so we thought something like MLFlow. We tried these a bit but it has an initial learning process and it is time consuming to setup your whole pipeline at first.\n\n  \n\\-&gt; What would you guys advice in our case? Is there a specific platform you would recommend us going towards? Do you suggest just running in any VM on the cloud ? If yes, where and what frameworks would you suggest we use for our pipeline? Any suggestions are appreciated and I would be interested to see what computer vision companies use etc. Of course in our case the budget would ideally be less than 500 euros for the next 6 months in costs since we have no revenue and no funding, at least currently. \n\nTL;DR - Which are the most pain-free frameworks/platforms/ways to setup a full pipeline of data gathering -&gt; data labelling -&gt; data storage -&gt; different types of model training/pre-training -&gt; evaluation -&gt; comparison of models -&gt; deployment on our product etc. when we have a 500 euro budget for next 6 months making our lives as much as possible easy while being very flexible and able to  train different models, mess with backbones, transfer learning etc. without issues.\n\n  \nFeel free to ask for any additional information.\n\n  \nThanks!",

    "content": "I'm using a monocular system for estimating camera motion in forward/ backward direction. The camera is installed on a forklift working in warehouse, where there's a lot of relative motion, even when the forklift is standing still. I have built this initial approach using gemini, since I didn't knew this topic too well.\n\nMy current approach is as follows:  \n1. Grab keypoints from initial frame. (shitomasi method)  \n2. Track them across subsequent frames using Lucas Kannade algorithm.  \n3. Using the radial vectors, I calculate whether the camera is moving forward or backward: (explained in detail using gemini)\n\nDivergence Score Calculation\n\nThe script mathematically checks if the flow is radiating outward or contracting inward by using the **dot product**.\n\n1. **Center-to-Feature Vectors:** The script calculates a vector from the image center to each feature point (`center_to_feature_vectors = good_old - center`). This vector is the radial line from the center to the feature.\n2. **Dot Product:** It calculates the dot product between the radial vector and the feature's actual flow vector: Dot Product=Radial Vector⋅Flow Vector\n3. **Interpretation:**\n   * **Positive Dot Product:** The flow vector is moving **in the same direction** as the radial vector (i.e., **outward** from the center). This indicates **Expansion (Forward Motion)**.\n   * **Negative Dot Product:** The flow vector is moving **in the opposite direction** of the radial vector (i.e., **inward** toward the center). This indicates **Contraction (Backward Motion)**.\n4. **Mean Divergence Score:** By taking the mean of the signs of all these dot products (`np.mean(np.sign(dot_products))`), the script gets a single, normalized score:\n   * A score close to +1 means almost all features are expanding (strong forward motion).\n   * A score close to −1 means almost all features are contracting (strong backward motion).\n5. I reinitialize the keypoints if they are lost due to strong movement.\n\n  \nThe issue is that it's not robust enough. In the scene, there are people walking towards/ away from the camera. And there are other forklifts in the scene as well. \n\nHow can I improve on my approach? What are some algorithms that I can use in this case (traditional CV and deep learning based approaches)? Also, This solution has to run on raspberry pi/ Jetson Nano SBC.\n\n\n\n ",

Currently my pipeline is to use a YOLOv8 pose model to detect court keypoints, and then use OpenCV to calculate a homography matrix to map everything onto a top-down view of the court.\n\nI'm struggling to get an accurate keypoint detection model. I've trained a model on about 50 manually annotated frames in roboflow but the predictions are consistently inaccurate, often with a systematic offset. I suspect I'm annotating in a wrong way. There's not too much variation in the images because the camera angle from the footage has a fixed position. It zooms in and out slightly but the keypoints always remain in view. \n\nWhat I've done so far:\n\n* Dataset Structure: I'm using a single object class called court.\n* Bounding Box Strategy: I'm trying to be very consistent with my bounding boxes, anchoring them tightly to specific court landmarks (the baseline, the top of the 3pt arc, and the 3pt corners) on every frame.\n* Keypoint Placement: I'm aiming for high precision, placing keypoints on the exact centre of line intersections.\n\nDespite this, my model is still not performing well and I'm wondering if I'm missing something key.\n\nHow can I improve my annotations? Is there a better way to define the bounding box or select the keypoints to build a more robust and accurate model?\n\nI've attached three images to show my process:\n\n1. My Target 2D Map: This is the simple, top-down court I want to map the coordinates onto.\n2. My Annotation Example: This shows how I'm currently drawing the tight bounding box and placing the keypoints.\n3. My Model's Inaccurate Output: This shows the predictions from my current model on a test frame. You can see how the points are consistently offset.\n\nAny tips or resources from those who have worked on similar sports analytics or homography projects would be greatly appreciated.",

We generated synthetic datasets that support a broad range of simulated modalities: colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy, hysteroscopy. \n\nDuring acceptance testing with a customer, we benchmarked classification performance for detecting two lesion types:\n\n* **Synthetic data results:** Recall 95%, Precision 94%  \n* **Real data results:** Recall 85%, Precision 83%\n\nBeyond performance, synthetic datasets eliminate privacy concerns and allow tailoring for rare or underrepresented lesion classes.\n\nCurious to hear what others think — especially about broader applications of synthetic data in clinical imaging.

Siendo uno de los principales problemas el hecho de que el modelo segmenta fallas que no son.

What's the best approach here, to catch the rotated image? Shall I use some kind of DL models, or are there any classic CV approaches?\n* **to find a deffects caused by printing heads**:\n   * Printing head has nozzles, that sometimes are being plugged. The result is the line on the print, which I want to detect\n   * Changes in the color of the image relative to the original digital image - I thought of creating some kind of mask, which will analyze the colors of the image if they have a right value. The problem here is that I print with CMYK color range, but the camera captures image with RGB.\n\nSo tl;dr I want to create a program that is able to:  \n\\- check if the printed pattern on the paper matches the original digital design  \n\\- finds deffects on the printed pattern, like lines, or any other defects  \n\\- checks if the color saturation is ok\n\nPhysical setup:\n\nThere will be a linear camera (meaning the image can be infinitely long), and the analyzed printout will travel on a conveyor belt. Image collection will simply be integrated with the conveyor belt's movement, ensuring the image is the correct size. I'm aware that lighting will be crucial, but for now, I'm assuming the light intensity will remain constant. All prints will be with the same image. I assume the lighting will be perfect.\n\nAny tips, papers, or code examples would be really appreciated",

I have a custom dataset of (image, question, answer) pairs ready.\n\nI'm currently considering two main paths:\n\n1. **Fine-tuning a Vision-Language (VL) Model:** This involves taking a strong base model and fine-tuning it directly on my dataset.\n2. **Agentic Approach using LangChain/LangGraph:** This involves using a powerful, general-purpose VL model as a \"tool\" within a larger agentic system. The agent, built with a framework like LangChain or LangGraph, could decompose a complex question, use the VL model to perform specific visual perception tasks, and then synthesize a final answer based on the results.\n\nMy primary goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy and robustness. Which of these two paths would you generally recommend, and what are the key trade-offs I should be aware of?\n\nAdditionally, I would be extremely grateful for any pointers to helpful resources:\n\n* **GitHub Repositories or Libraries:** Any examples or tools you've found useful, especially for implementing the agentic VQA approach.\n* **Reference Materials:** Key research papers, tutorials, or blog posts that compare these strategies or provide guidance.\n* **Alternative Methods:** Any other state-of-the-art models or techniques I might be overlooking for this kind of task.\n\nThanks in advance for your time and insights\n\n",

It's 240fps with mixed lighting, and the performance just tanks with any clutter, motion blur, or partial occlusions.\n\nThe setup is a YOLO-family backbone, training imgsz is around 1280 cause of VRAM limits. Tried the usual stuff. Higher imgsz, class-aware sampling, copy-paste, mosaic, some HSV and blur augs. Also ran some experiments with slicing like SAHI, but the results are mixed. In a lot of clips, blur is a way bigger problem than object scale.\n\nLooking for thoughts on a few things.\n\nP2 head vs SAHI for these tiny targets, what's the actual accuracy and latency trade-off you've seen? Any good starter YAMLs? What loss and NMS settings are people using? Any preferred Focal/Varifocal settings or box loss that boosts recall without spiking the FPs? For augs, anything beyond mosaic that actually helps with motion blur or rolling shutter on 240fps footage? Also trying to figure out the best way to handle the hard examples without overfitting. Any lightweight deblur pre-processing that plays nice with detectors at this frame rate?\n\nFor tracking, what's the go-to for tiny, fast objects with momentary occlusions? BYTE, OC-SORT, BoT-SORT? What params are you guys using? Has anyone tried training a larger teacher model and distilling down? Wondering if it gives a noticeable bump in recall for tiny objects.\n\nAlso, how are you evaluating this stuff beyond mAP50/95?

Checking things like if the diameter is in tolerance, the “teeth”, etc. The max part size would be 2 inches (50.8mm) in diameter. I was originally going to use a telecentric lens mounted over a small conveyor belt, but I haven’t been able to find one for less than $2,000. I will have a calibration/reference image at the same height as the part, and the camera will be in a fixed position. Ideally I’ll be able to measure the parts with an accuracy of +/-0.001 in (0.025mm). Are there any cheaper camera/lens options available? ",

Is there a website I could go that would let me upload my 2 images and have it search one of them for the other? Or is there a program I can download that does this?

For industrial vision, what are the *essential concepts* I should understand (beyond OpenCV)?\n2. Which C++ techniques or patterns are critical when working with image buffers / real-time processing?\n3. Any recommended resources, tutorials, or SDKs (Basler Pylon, Allied Vision Vimba, etc.) that can give me a quick but solid overview?\n\nThe goal isn’t to become an expert in a week, but to demonstrate a strong foundation, quick learning curve, and awareness of industry standards.\n\nAny advice, resources, or personal experience would be greatly appreciated 🙏",

Our paper is available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22889) 👈\n\n# 🔑 Highlights\n\n* **General-purpose**: CST supports a broad range of tasks, including Contextualized Image Classification and Set Anomaly Detection.\n* Outperforms existing set-learning methods such as [Deep Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114) and [Set Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00825) in image-set processing.\n* Natively compatible with **CNN explainability tools** (e.g., Grad-CAM), unlike competing approaches.\n* First set-learning architecture with demonstrated **Transfer Learning support** — we release **CST-15**, pre-trained on ImageNet.\n\n# 💻 Code and Pre-trained Models (cstmodels)\n\nWe release the `cstmodels` Python package (`pip install cstmodels`) which provides reusable Keras 3 layers for building CST architectures, and an easy interface to load CST-15 pre-trained on ImageNet in just two lines of code:\n\n    from cstmodels import CST15\n    model = CST15(pretrained=True)\n\n📑 [API Docs](https://chinefed.github.io/convolutional-set-transformer/)  \n🖥 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer)\n\n# 🧪 Tutorial Notebooks\n\n* [Training a toy CST from scratch on the CIFAR-10 dataset](https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer/blob/main/tutorial_notebooks/cst_from_scratch.ipynb)\n* [Transfer Learning with CST-15 on colorectal histology images ](https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer/blob/main/tutorial_notebooks/cst15_transfer_learning.ipynb)\n\n# 🌟 Application Example: Set Anomaly Detection\n\n**Set Anomaly Detection** is a binary classification task meant to identify images in a set that are **anomalous or inconsistent with the majority of the set**.\n\nThe Figure below shows two sets from CelebA. In each, most images share two attributes (*“wearing hat &amp; smiling”* in the first, *“no beard &amp; attractive”* in the second), while a minority lack both of them and are thus anomalous.\n\nAfter training a CST and a Set Transformer (Lee et al., 2019) on CelebA for Set Anomaly Detection, we evaluate the explainability of their predictions by overlaying Grad-CAMs on anomalous images.\n\n✅ **CST highlights the anomalous regions correctly**  \n⚠️ **Set Transformer fails to provide meaningful explanations**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am9yyfhgxjsf1.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4380db5d19858af31697538807c04a2ec4981155\n\nWant to dive deeper?

    "content": "I want to create my own YOLOv8 loss function to tailor it to my very specific usecase (for academic purposes). To do that, I need access to bounding boxes and their corresponding classes. I'm using Ultralytics implementation (https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). I know the loss function is defined in ultralytics/utils/loss.py in class v8DetectionLoss. I've read the code and found two tensors: target\\_scores and target\\_bboxes. The first one is of size e.g. 12x8400x12 (I think it's batch size by number of bboxes by number of classes) and the second one of size 12x8400x4 (probably batch size by number of bboxes by number of coordinates). The numbers in target\\_scores are between 0 and 1 (so I guess it's probability) and the numbers in the second one are probably coordinates in pixels.\n\nTo be sure what they represent, I took my fine-tuned model, segmented an image and then started training the model with a debugger with only one element in the training set which is the image I segmented earlier (I put a breakpoint inside the loss function). I wanted to compare what the debugger sees during training in the first epoch with the image segmented with the same model. I took 15 elements with highest probability of belonging to some class (by searching through target\\_scores with something similar to argmax) and looked at what class they are predicted to belong to and their corresponding bboxes. I expected it to match the segmented image. The problem is that they don't match at all. The elements with the highest probabilities are of completely different classes than the elements with the highest probabilities in the segmented image. The bboxes seen through debugger don't make sense at all as well (although they seem to be bboxes because their coordinates are between 0 and 640, which is the resolution I trained the model with). I know that it's a very specific question but maybe you can see something wrong with my approach.",

The challenge is making a reliable distinction between the two in real time.\n\nMy current approach:\n\n* Use **YOLO11l-pose** for person detection (it seems more reliable on near-view people than yolo11l).\n* For each detected person, run a **YOLO11l-cls** classifier (trained on a custom dataset) with three classes: `no_phone`, `phone`, and `landline_phone`.\n\nThis should let me flag phone vs landline usage, but the issue is dataset size, right now I only have \\~5 videos each (1–2 people talking for about a minute). As you can guess, my first training runs haven’t been great. I’ll also most likely end up with a very large \\`no\\_phone\\` class compared to the others.\n\nI’d like to know:\n\n* Does this seem like a solid approach, or are there better alternatives?\n* Any tips for improving YOLO classification training (dataset prep, augmentations, loss tuning, etc.)?\n* Would a different pipeline (e.g., two-stage detection vs. end-to-end training) work better here?",

    "content": "We're working with quite some videos of radar movements like the above. We are interested in the flight paths of birds. In the above example, I indicated with a red arrow an example of birds flying. Sadly, we are not working with the direct logs, rather the output images/videos.  \n\n\nAs you can see, there is quite a bit of noise, as well as that birds and their flights are small and are difficult to detect. \n\nIdeally, we would like to have a model that automatically detects the birds, and is able to connect flight paths (the radar is georeferenced). In our eyes, the model should also be temporal (e.g., with tracking or such a temporal model such as LSTM) to learn the characteristics of a bird flight and to discern bird movement from static (like the noise) and clouds. \n\nBut my expertise is lacking, and something is telling me that this use case is too difficult. Is it? If not, what would be a solid methodology, and what models are potentially suited? When I think of an LSTM (in combination with CNN for example), I think it looks at a time trajectory of a single pixel, when in fact a bird movement takes place over multiple of pixels.\n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

The backstory is that I am trying to finish my PhD in Visual SLAM and I am struggling to find proper educational materials on the internet. Therefore I started to create my own app which summarizes the main insights I am gaining during my research and learning process. The app is continously updated. I did not share the idea anywhere yet and in the r/appideas subreddit I just read the suggestion to talk about your idea *before* actually implementing it.\n\nNow I am curious what the CV community thinks about my project. I know it is unusual to post the app here and I was considering posting it in the appideas subreddit instead. But I think you are the right community to show it to, as you may have the same struggle as I do. Or maybe you do not see any value in such an app? Would you mind sharing your opinion? What do you really need to improve your knowledge or what would bring you the most benefit?\n\nLooking forward to reading your valuable feedback. Thank you!",

The approach in my mind is train EfficientNetV2 for classification, and then YOLOv11-seg for segmenting different body parts (I tried the basic UNet model but it has poor results, YOLOv11-seg has good results, what other segmentation models should I use?). Use both models separately for species and body part labeling. But is there any better approach?",

    "content": "All taken for our consulting work, we have ended up with 1m images going back to 2010, they're all owned by us and the majority are taken by me also. We appear to have created a superb archive of imagery, unwittingly, perhaps. \n\nThus we have compiled a comprehensive retail image dataset that might be useful for the community:\n\n**Our Dataset Overview:**\n\n* **Size:** 1M total images, 280K highly structured/curated by event.\n* **Coverage:** UK, US, Netherlands, Ireland retail environments. Predominantly UK.\n* **Organisation:** Categorised by year/month, retailer, season, product category (down to SKU level for organised subset of imagery).\n* **Range:** Multi year coverage including seasonal merchandising patterns (Christmas, Easter, Diwali, Valentine's Day etc, over 60 events)\n* **Use cases:** Planogram compliance, shelf monitoring, inventory management, out of stock detection, product recognition, autonomous checkout systems, signage, all images are used for our consulting work so these do not feature people and images are detailed and not simply random images in stores. \n\n**What makes this unique:**\n\n* Multi market data (different retail formats, lighting, merchandising across 4 countries and thousands of store locations and hundreds of banners)\n* Temporal dimension showing how displays evolve seasonally and generally (IE general store development) across the years and locations. \n* Professional curation (not just raw dumps) by year / month / retailer / type etc. \n* Implementation support and custom sorting is available, we can offer further support to aid model training and other elements.  \n\n**Availability:** We're making this available for commercial and research use. Academic researchers can inquire about discounted licensing, it's a brave new world for us so we are testing the water to see what interest there is, and how we may be able to market this. It's a new world entirely. We think there are use cases that we would develop (IE how has value for shoppers changed, inflation tracking, shrinkflation, best practice and showcasing what happened, when etc from a trade plan perspective).\n\nThis dataset addresses a common pain point we've observed: retail CV models struggling to see and visualise across different store environments and international markets. The temporal component is particularly valuable for understanding seasonal variations, especially as time has progressed in food retail, good / bad etc. \n\n**Interested?**\n\n* Please send me a DM for sample images, detailed specifications, and pricing, we have worked up a sample and have manifests and readme etc. \n* Looking for feedback from researchers on what additional annotations would be most valuable.\n* Open to partnerships with serious ML teams. \n\nHappy to answer questions in the comments about collection methodology, image quality, or specific use cases too. It's fully owned by us as a dataset and de-duplication has taken place on the seasonal aspect (280k) images already, folder names need to be harmonised though..... The bigger dataset is organised by month / week / retailer. ",

Since you have to set values for the colors, other parts of the image that fall within the same range show up too, not just the sky.\n\nIs there a better way to mask out specific parts of an image (like only the sky) or to automatically calculate how warm/cold the white values are?\n\nSorry if this sounds super basic I’m just starting out and this is my first attempt at diving into computer vision.",

The images are ai generated. \n- the dresses are shuffled using fisher yates shuffle algorithm.\n- I am only storing info about them like top red shirt , bottom black jeans, gender male , with created timestamp, status like approve or reject . In supabase \n- I have attached the image showing the the clothes I currently have in the website right now . Both for male and female.\n\nNow I will come to the doubts and questions I have . \n- I thought I could just fintune a model . now I am just confused on what and how to do it. \n- I also need to integrate other features like weather based recommendation like wear this as it is sunny or this as it is rainy . \n- I also have to recommend for the occasion. Like for college wear this. According to their daily commute. Atleast that's the vague idea I have . That is what I proposed. \n- there is Polyvore Dataset but I don't know how to train a model with it . I thought I can create a base model with this and then add indian ethnic outfits later.  \n- I don't know anyother dataset for my project. Is there is any .

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm in the planning stages of a mobile application (targeting Android first, then iOS) and I'm trying to get a reality check on the final APK size before I get too deep into development. My goal is to keep the total application size **under 150 MB**.\n\n**The Core Functionality:**  \nThe app needs to run several different detection tasks offline (e.g., body detection, specific object tracking, etc.). My plan is to use separate, pre-trained YOLOv8 models for each task, converted to **TensorFlow Lite** for on-device inference.\n\n**My Current Technical Assumptions:**\n\n* **Framework:** TensorFlow Lite for offline inference.\n* **Models:** I'll start with the smallest possible models (e.g., YOLOv8n-nano) for each task.\n* **Optimization:** I plan to use post-training quantization (likely INT8) during the TFLite conversion to minimize model sizes.\n\n**My Size Estimate Breakdown:**\n\n* TFLite Runtime Library: \\~3-5 MB\n* App Code &amp; Basic UI: \\~10-15 MB\n* **Remaining Budget for Models: \\~130 MB**\n\n**My Specific Questions for the Community:**\n\n1. **Is my overall approach sound?** Does using multiple, specialized TFLite models seem like the right way to handle multiple detection types offline?\n2. **Model Size Experience:** For those who've deployed YOLOv8n/s as TFLite models, what final file sizes are you seeing after quantization? (e.g., Is a quantized YOLOv8n for a single class around \\~2-3 MB?).\n3. **Hidden Overheads:** Are there any significant size overheads I might be missing? For example, does using the TFLite GPU delegate add considerable size? Or are there large native libraries for image pre-processing I should account for?\n4. **Optimization Tips:** Beyond basic quantization, are there other TFLite conversion tricks or model pruning techniques specific to YOLO that can shave off crucial megabytes without killing accuracy?\n\nI'm especially interested in hearing from anyone who has actually shipped an app with a similar multi-model, offline detection setup. Thanks in advance for any insights—it will really help me validate the project's feasibility!",

Also I will probably have more data in the future but not thousands of images unfortunately. \n\nI know some models also include segmentation but I just need the detected objects, doesn't matter if bounding box or boundaries.\n\nHere are my findings:\n\n* YOLOE \n   * initial results were okayish\n   * fine-tuning works but was a little tricky to set up (https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yoloe/#fine-tuning-on-custom-dataset) \n      * IIRC to get it to work I needed to include 80 classes in the dataset.yaml even though only trained on a few (I think because it was trained on 80 classes and expects this for the dataset.yaml somehow)\n      * ability to choose how many layers to freeze during fine-tuning\n   * ONNX export is included out of the box\n* OWLViT/OWLv2\n   * best out of the box performance\n   * no official fine-tuning code but few GitHub issues exist addressing this with one possible code example:\n      * code: [https://github.com/stevebottos/owl-vit-object-detection](https://github.com/stevebottos/owl-vit-object-detection) (haven't tried yet)\n      * [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/20091](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/20091)\n      * [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/28778](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/28778)\n      * [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/33664](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/33664)\n   * ONNX models available on huggingface but not sure if fine-tuned models could also be easily exported as ONNX (https://github.com/huggingface/optimum/issues/1713)\n* Grounding Dino\n   * initial results were okayish but it's comparatively slow\n   * fine-tuning via mmdetection (https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/issues/228)\n   * ONNX export might be supported by mmdetection but apart from that only found a drive link in GitHub comments (https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/issues/156)\n* DETIC\n   * initial results were okayish \n   * have not found a way yet to fine-tune\n   * ONNX export via long script here: [https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detic/issues/113](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detic/issues/113)\n\n  \nRecently, I looked a little bit at DINOv3 but so far couldn't get it to run for object detection and have no idea about ONNX export and fine-tuning. Just read that it is supposed to have really good performance.\n\n  \nAre there any other models you know of that fulfill my criteria (zero shot object detection + fine-tuning + ONNX export) and you would recommend trying?\n\n  \nThank you :)",

    "title": "Alternative to NAS: A New Approach for Finding Neural Network Architectures",
    "content": "Over the past two years, we have been working at One Ware on a project that provides an alternative to classical Neural Architecture Search. So far, it has shown the best results for image classification and object detection tasks with one or multiple images as input.\n\nThe idea: Instead of testing thousands of architectures, the existing dataset is analyzed (for example, image sizes, object types, or hardware constraints), and from this analysis, a suitable network architecture is predicted.\n\nCurrently, foundation models like YOLO or ResNet are often used and then fine-tuned with NAS. However, for many specific use cases with tailored datasets, these models are vastly oversized from an information-theoretic perspective. Unless the network is allowed to learn irrelevant information, which harms both inference efficiency and speed. Furthermore, there are architectural elements such as Siamese networks or the support for multiple sub-models that NAS typically cannot support. The more specific the task, the harder it becomes to find a suitable universal model.\n\n**How our method works**  \nOur approach combines two steps. First, the dataset and application context are automatically analyzed. For example, the number of images, typical object sizes, or the required FPS on the target hardware. This analysis is then linked with knowledge from existing research and already optimized neural networks. The result is a prediction of which architectural elements make sense: for instance, how deep the network should be or whether specific structural elements are needed. A suitable model is then generated and trained, learning only the relevant structures and information. This leads to much faster and more efficient networks with less overfitting.\n\n**First results**  \nIn our first whitepaper, our neural network was able to improve accuracy from 88% to 99.5% by reducing overfitting. At the same time, inference speed increased by several factors, making it possible to deploy the model on a small FPGA instead of requiring an NVIDIA GPU. If you already have a dataset for a specific application, you can test our solution yourself and in many cases you should see significant improvements in a very short time. The model generation is done in 0.7 seconds and further optimization is not needed.",

I found out it’s actually using Tesseract OCR in the background, and I’ve heard that Tesseract itself is what I should be using directly. The issue is, I have no idea how to properly run Tesseract. When I tried opening it, it only let me upload sample images, and the results came out inaccurate.\n\nSo my question is: how do I use Tesseract with AHK to reliably capture text with high accuracy? Is there a way to improve the results? Any advice from experts here would be really appreciated ..!",

That feels like a shift for CV models, where instead of training separate depth/flow/segmentation networks, you get those “for free” from the same world model.\n\nWould love to hear others’ thoughts: could this be a step toward more general-purpose CV backbones, or just another specialized world model?",

    "content": "Mods, apologies in advance if this isn't allowed!\n\n  \nHey all! I'm a current part time US PhD student while working full time as a software engineer. My original background was in embedded work, then a stint as an AI/ML engineer, and now currently I work in the modeling/simulation realm. It has gotten to the time for me to start thinking about getting my committee together, and I need one external member. I had reached out at work, but the couple people I talked to wanted to give me their project to do for their specific organization/team, which I'm not interested in doing (for a multitude of reasons, the biggest being my work not being mine and having to be turned over to that organization/team). As I work full time, my job \"pays\" for my PhD, and so I'm not tethered to a grant or specific project, and have the freedom to direct my research however I see fit with my advisor, and that's one of the biggest benefits in my opinion.\n\n  \nThat being said, we have not tacked down specifically the problem I will be working towards for my dissertation, but rather the general area thus far. I am working in the space of 3D reconstruction from raw video only, without any additional sensors or camera pose information, specifically in dense, kinetic outdoor scenes (with things like someone videoing them touring a city). I have been tinkering with Dust3r/Mast3r and most recently Nvidia's ViPE, as an example. We have some ideas for improvements we have brainstormed, but that's about as far as we've gotten.\n\n  \nSo, if any of you who would be considered \"professionals\" (this is a loose term, my advisor says basically you'd just need to submit a CV and he's the determining authority on whether or not someone qualifies, you do NOT need a PhD) and might be interested in being my external committee member, please feel free to DM me and we can set up a time to chat and discuss further!\n\nEdit: after fielding some questions, here is some additional info:\n- You do NOT need to be from/in the US\n- Responsibilities include: attending the depth exam, proposal defense, and dissertation defense (can be remotely, about 1.5-2 hours apiece, just the 3 occurrences), and be willing to review my writings when I get there, though my advisor is primarily responsible for that. Any other involvement above and beyond that is greatly appreciated, but certainly not required!",

Now I’m doing a 6-month internship in computer vision working on **3D mechanical data** (industrial context) in order to validate my degree. I’m the only CS/AI person in the team so it’s very autonomous.\n\nDespite these experiences, I feel my **core programming skills** aren’t strong enough . I want to dedicate **2–3 hours per day** to structured self-study alongside the internship.\n\nI’d really appreciate suggestions on a simple weekly structure I can follow to strengthen Python fundamentals, testing, and clean code, plus a couple of practical mini-project ideas in CV/3D that go beyond tutorials. If you also have a short list of resources that genuinely improved your coding and debugging, I’m all ears. Thanks for reading !!",

    "content": "https://reddit.com/link/1nnz7ra/video/nhtyxqwyasqf1/player\n\nIn this update, I focused on making the solution smarter, more reliable, and closer to real-world deployment.🔑 Key Enhancements in v2.0:✅ Stable Bag IDs with IoU matching – ensures consistent tracking even when IDs change ✅ Owner locked forever – once a bag has an owner, it remains tied to them ✅ Robust against ByteTrack ID reuse – time-based logic prevents ID recycling issues ✅ \"No Owner\" state – clearly identifies when a bag is unattended ✅ Owner left ROI detection – raises an alert if the original owner exits the Region of Interest ✅ Improved alerting system – more accurate and context-aware abandoned object warnings⚡ Why this matters:Public safety in airports, train stations, and crowded areas often depends on the ability to spot unattended baggage quickly and accurately. By combining detection, tracking, and temporal logic, this system moves beyond simple object detection into practical surveillance intelligence.🎯 Next steps:Real-time CCTV integrationOn-device optimizations for edge deploymentExpanding logic for group behavior and suspicious movement patternsYou can follow me on Youtube as well:👉 [youtube.com/@daanidev](http://youtube.com/@daanidev)💡 This project blends computer vision + tracking + smart rules to make AI-powered surveillance more effective.Would love to hear your thoughts! 👉 How else do you think we can extend this for real-world deployment?[hashtag#YOLOv11](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23yolov11&amp;origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#ComputerVision](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23computervision&amp;origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#ByteTrack](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23bytetrack&amp;origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#AI](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23ai&amp;origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#DeepLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23deeplearning&amp;origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#Surveillance](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23surveillance&amp;origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#Security](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23security&amp;origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED) [hashtag#OpenCV](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23opencv&amp;origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED)",

    "content": "For context I'm inexperienced in this field, and mostly do google search + use llms to eventually train a model for my task. Unfortunately when it came to this topic, I couldn't find an answer that I felt is reliable.\n\nCurrently following this guide [https://albumentations.ai/docs/3-basic-usage/image-classification/](https://albumentations.ai/docs/3-basic-usage/image-classification/) because I thought it'll be good to use since I have a very small dataset. My understanding is that prediction transforms should look like the val transforms in the guide:\n\n    val_transforms = A.Compose([\n        A.Resize(28, 28),\n        A.Normalize(mean=[0.1307], std=[0.3081]),\n        A.ToTensorV2(),\n    ])\n\nbut since albumentations is an augmentation library I thought it's probably not meant for use in predictions and I probably should use something like this instead:\n\n    pred_transforms = torchvision.transforms.Compose([\n        torchvision.transforms.Resize((28, 28)),\n        torchvision.transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.1307], std=[0.3081]),\n        torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(),\n    ])\n\nin which case I should also use this for `val_transforms` and only use `albumentations` for `train_transforms`, no?\n\n",

Would techniques like **domain adaptation** or **synthetic data generation** be worth exploring here?\n2. Any recommendations on handling **class imbalance** in small datasets (1 class dominates \\~70% of labels)?\n3.

    "content": "🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Real-time Abandoned Object Detection using YOLOv11n! 🎥🧳\n\nI implemented YOLOv11n to automatically detect and track abandoned objects (like bags, backpacks, and suitcases) within a Region of Interest (ROI) in a video stream. This system is designed with public safety and surveillance in mind.\n\nKey highlights of the workflow: \n\n✅ Detection of persons and bags using YOLOv11n \n\n✅ Tracking objects within a defined ROI for smarter monitoring \n\n✅ Proximity-based logic to check if a bag is left unattended \n\n✅ Automatic alert system with blinking warnings when an abandoned object is detected\n\n✅ Optimized pipeline tested on real surveillance footage⚡ \n\nA crucial step here: combining object detection with temporal logic (tracking how long an item stays unattended) is what makes this solution practical for real-world security use cases.💡 \n\nNext step: extending this into a real-time deployment-ready system with live CCTV integration and mobile-friendly optimizations for on-device inference.",

    "content": "I was working on a course project, and the overall task is to consider two images;  \na content image (call it C) and a style image (call it S). Our model should be able to generate an image which captures the content of C and the style of S.   \nFor example we give a random image (of some building or anything) and the second image is of the Starry Night (by Van Gogh). The final output should be the first image in the style of the Starry Night.   \nNow our task asks us to specifically focus on a set of shifted domains (which mainly includes environmental shifts, such as foggy, rainy, snowy, misty etc.)  \nSo the content image that we provide (can be anything) needs to capture these environmental styles and generate the final image appropriately.  \nNeeded some insights so as to how I can start working on this. I have researched about the workings of Diffusion models, while my other team mate is focusing on GANs, and later we would combine our findings. \n\nHere is the word to word description of the task incase you want to have a read :- \n\n1. Team needs to consider a set of shifted domains (based on the discussion with allotted TAs) and natural environment based domain. 2. Team should explore the StyleGAN and Diffusion Models to come up with a mechanism which takes the input as the clean image (for content) and the reference shifted image (from set of shifted domains) and gives output as an image that has the content of clean image while mimicing the style of reference shifted image. 3. Team may need to develop generic shifted domain based samples. This must be verified by the concerned TAs. 4. Team should investigate what type of metrics can be considered to make sure that the output image mimics the distribution of the shifted image as much as possible. 5. Semantic characteristics of the clean input image must be present in the output style transferred image.\n\n",

    "content": "# We introduce Uni-CoT, the first unified Chain-of-Thought framework that handles both image understanding + generation to enable coherent visual reasoning [as shown in Figure 1]. Our model even can supports NanoBanana–style geography reasoning [as shown in Figure 2]!\n\nSpecifically, we use **one unified architecture** (inspired by Bagel/Omni/Janus) to support multi-modal reasoning. This minimizes discrepancy between reasoning trajectories and visual state transitions, enabling coherent cross-modal reasoning. However, the multi-modal reasoning with unified model raise a large burden on computation and model training.\n\n# To solve it, we propose a hierarchical Macro–Micro CoT:\n\n* **Macro-Level CoT** → global planning, decomposing a task into subtasks.\n* **Micro-Level CoT** → executes subtasks as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**, reducing token complexity and improving efficiency.\n\nThis **structured decomposition** shortens reasoning trajectories and lowers cognitive (and computational) load.\n\n# With this desigin, we build a novel training strategy for our Uni-CoT:\n\n* **Macro-level modeling**: refined on interleaved text–image sequences for global planning.\n* **Micro-level modeling**: auxiliary tasks (action generation, reward estimation, etc.) to guide efficient learning.\n* **Node-based reinforcement learning** to stabilize optimization across modalities.\n\n# Results:\n\n* Training efficiently only on **8 × A100 GPUs**\n* Inference efficiently only on 1 **× A100 GPU**\n* Achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on reasoning-driven benchmarks for image generation &amp; editing.\n\n# Resource:\n\nOur paper：https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05606\n\nGithub repo: [https://github.com/Fr0zenCrane/UniCoT](https://github.com/Fr0zenCrane/UniCoT)\n\nProject page: [https://sais-fuxi.github.io/projects/uni-cot/](https://sais-fuxi.github.io/projects/uni-cot/)",

The entire responsibility of collision avoidance and safe navigation was left to the autonomous system.\n\nWhat makes this interesting:\n\n* The same vehicle had earlier done a low-speed demo on a wide road for visitors from Japan.\n* In this run, the difficulty was raised — the car had to handle **adversarial traffic, cone negotiation, and even bi-directional traffic on a single lane** at much higher speeds.\n* All maneuvers (like the SUV cutting in at speed, the bike and cycle crossing suddenly, etc.) were done by the engineers themselves to test the system’s limits.\n\nThe decision-making framework behind this uses a **reinforcement learning policy**, which is being scaled towards full Level-5 autonomy.\n\nThe coolest part for me: watching the car calmly negotiate traffic that was actively trying to throw it off balance. Real-world, messy driving conditions are so much harder than clean test tracks — and that’s exactly the kind of robustness autonomous vehicles need.",

    "title": "Pose Estimation of a Planar Square from Multiple Calibrated Cameras",
    "content": "I'm trying to estimate the 3D pose of a known-edge planar square using multiple calibrated cameras. In each view, the four corners of the square are detected. Rather than triangulating each point independently, I want to treat the square as a single rigid object and estimate its global pose. All camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known and fixed.\n\nI’ve seen [algorithms for plane-based pose estimation](https://inria.hal.science/inria-00525671v1/document), but they treat the camera extrinsics as unknowns and focus on recovering them as well as the pose. In my case, the cameras are already calibrated and fixed in space.\n\nAny suggestions for approaches, relevant research papers, or libraries that handle this kind of setup?",

With [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XzlHOUiufd76ZPJNbH8qL-eJSuSjWc51/view?usp=sharing) I got [this image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f0-qITs04NFx7YiXC5FDS6mZj8JRF5RS/view?usp=sharing).\n\nDoes anyone know how to improve this code, or a better way to generate these motion plots automatically?

Odd number lines French. Even number lines the pronunciation guide.   \nNew words in a margin in odd numbered pages on the left on the right on even numbered pages. Images in the margin that go right up to the margin line. Occasional big line images in the main text.\n\nThe problem is the existing versions have a photocopy looking text. And they include the pronunciation guide that is not needed now the audio is easy to get. Also these doubles+ the size of the text to be print out. How would you remove the pronunciation lines, rewrite the french text to make it look like properly typed words. And recombine the result into a shorter book?\n\nI have tried Label Studio to mark up the images, margin and main but its time consuming and the combine these back into a book that looks pretty much the same but is shorter i cannot get to look right. \n\nAny suggestions for tools or similar projects you did would be really interesting. Normal pdf extraction of text works but it mixes up margin and main text and freaks out about the pronunciation lines.\n\n",

The idea is to detect the face of the human and prove the liveliness by blinking twice. However, I'm unable to do so and stuck for the last 7 days. I tried following things so far:\n\n* I extract landmark values for open vs. closed eyes and check the difference. If the change crosses a threshold twice, liveness is confirmed.\n* For occlusion checks, I measure distances between jawline, lips, and nose landmarks. If it crosses a threshold, occlusion detected.\n* I also need to ensure the user isn’t wearing glasses, but detecting that via landmarks hasn’t been reliable, especially with rimless glasses.\n\nthis “landmark math” approach isn’t giving consistent results, and I’m new to ML. Since the solution needs to run **on-device** for speed and better UX, Mediapipe seemed the right choice, but I’m getting failed consistently.\n\nCan anyone please help me how can I accomplish this?",

    "content": "So, this is a follow up to my questions for my Bachelor Thesis, in which I compare a few models for the segmentation of industrial objects, like screwdrivers. I already labeled all my data with segmentation masks(SAM2 and YOLOv11) and in parallel also built a strong YOLOv11 Model as CNN centric model. I will also take in YOOv12 as a hybrid between CNN an Transformer and I will maybe see how good DINOv3 is as a newer model(not necessary, just a nice to have).\n\nNow the question is which model I should add as a Transformer based model, I thought about DETR but I often see that it is mostly for detection, not for segmentation. What are some state of the art models right now for Transformer based models? \n\nThe model must also be loaded onto a NVIDIA Jetson Orin and work well with the OAK-D Camera, because the model will be working on a robotic arm.\n\nThankful for every help I get, If you need any more information, let me know. I will try to answer it. There could also be a few informations on my previous post, maybe that can help-",

Then I’ll take it a step further and supervised fine-tune the model with images of avocados at different ripeness stages, using my knowledge from growing up around them.\n\nWould you use something like this?

    "content": "Hey r/computervision!\n\nThis might be the silliest of the silliest question but I am getting nuts. I have seen in a couple of repos and coco datasets that objectw polygons are segmented as clockwise (see https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/issues/153). This is mostly a non-issue, particularly with simple objects. The matter become more complex when dealing with occluded objects or objects with holes. Unfortunately, the dataset I am dealing with has both (sad), see a previous post that I opened here: https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1meqpd2/instance\\_segmentation\\_nightmare\\_2700x2700\\_images/.\n\nNow, I managed to manually annotate images in a way that each object is an integer on the image. This way, the image encoded discontinued objects by just having the same number. The issue comes when conversting the dataset to COCO for training (I am aiming to use DETR or similar). Here, when I use libraries such as shapely/scykit-image I get that positive boundaries are counter-clockwise and holes are clockwise. I just want to know if I need to revert those guys for training and to visualise with any standard library. I have enclosed a dummy image with few polygons and the orientations that I get in order to illustrate my point.\n\n  \nAgain, this might be super silly, but given the fact that I am new here, I just want to clarify and get the thing correct from the beginning.\n\n# Obj ID  Expected                        Skimage Class                   Shapely Class                   Orientation Pattern\n\n2       two\\_disconnected\\_circles        two\\_circles             two\\_circles             \\[ccw, ccw\\] / \\[ccw, ccw\\]   \n5       two\\_circles\\_one\\_with\\_hole       1\\_ext\\_2\\_holes           1\\_ext\\_2\\_holes           \\[ccw, ccw, cw\\] / \\[ccw, ccw, cw\\]   \n6       circle\\_with\\_hole        circle\\_with\\_hole        circle\\_with\\_hole        \\[ccw, cw\\] / \\[ccw, cw\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oh9vqtxnmjpf1.png?width=128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00cb02b59b2ba580001bac9f9b77118b2faceb53\n\n",

In a closely coupled system I would train a model on a set of “customer order IDs” (the goal being to infer which orders get returned) and the framework would automatically gather the images from our database and feed them into PyTorch or whatever. OTOH in a loosely coupled system I would train the model directly on the images. \n\nIn the later scenario I can easily switch between model training frameworks (for example timm includes a nice script for training classification models), but in the former I have to think less about the peculiarities of our business data. \n\nAny thoughts on this?

    "content": "Throwaway account since this is for my actual job and my colleagues will also want to see your replies. \n\n**TL;DR:** We’re adding a new feature to our model training service: the ability to define subsets or combinations of datasets (instead of always training on the full dataset). We need help choosing a name for this concept — see shortlist below and let us know what you think.\n\n——\n\nI’m part of a team building a training service for computer vision models. At the moment, when you launch a training job on our platform, you can only pick one entire dataset to train on. That works fine in simple cases, but it’s limiting if you want more control — for example, combining multiple datasets, filtering classes, or defining your own splits.\n\nWe’re introducing a new concept to fix this: a way to *describe* the dataset you actually want to train on, instead of always being stuck with a full dataset.\n\n**High-level idea**\n\nUsers should be able to:\n\n* Select subsets of data (specific classes, percentages, etc.)\n* Merge multiple datasets into one\n* Define train/val/test splits\n* Save these instructions and reuse them across trainings\n\nSo instead of always training on the “raw” dataset, you’d train on your **defined** dataset, and you could reuse or share that definition later.\n\n**Technical description**\n\nUnder the hood, this is a new Python module that works alongside our existing Dataset module. Our current Dataset module executes operations immediately (filter, merge, split, etc.). This new module, however, is **lazy**: it just *registers* the operations. When you call .build(), the operations are executed and a Dataset object is returned. The module can also export its operations into a human-readable JSON file, which can later be reloaded into Python. That way, a dataset definition can be shared, stored, and executed consistently across environments.\n\nNow we’re debating what to actually call this concept, and we'd appreciate your input. Here’s the shortlist we’ve been considering:\n\n* Data Definitions\n* Data Specs\n* Data Specifications\n* Data Selections\n* Dataset Pipeline\n* Dataset Graph\n* Lazy Dataset\n* Dataset Query\n* Dataset Builder\n* Dataset Recipe\n* Dataset Config\n* Dataset Assembly\n\nWhat do you think works best here? Which names make the most sense to you as an ML/computer vision developer? And are there any names we should rule out right away because they’re misleading?\n\nPlease vote, comment, or suggest alternatives.",
