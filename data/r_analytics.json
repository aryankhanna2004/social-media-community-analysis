    "content": "I graduated a few months ago with a degree in Information Systems and have been applying for entry-level data analyst roles since. The pattern’s the same everywhere like “2-3 years experience,” “must know SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI,” and sometimes domain knowledge in finance or healthcare. It’s discouraging when the “junior” listings read like mid-level job specs.\n\nI’ve been trying to focus on what I can actually improve by tightening my case studies, running through take-home tasks, and recording a few mock interviews to practice structuring answers. Sometimes I use tools like chatgpt, mind map, and interview assistant like Beyz while I rehearse. It catches when I drift off or forget to explain the business context behind a metric. \n\nStill, I’m not sure what’s most effective at this stage. Should I broaden the search toward roles like business analyst or reporting analyst just to get a foot in the door? Or is it better to double down on one domain and build deeper examples around it?\n\nIf anyone here recently broke into analytics, I’d love to hear what worked - projects, interview prep, or just ways to stay motivated when it feels like every listing wants someone who’s already done the job.",

    "content": "Hey all I could really use some career advice from this community.\n\nI was fortunate to land 2 offers in this market, but now I’m struggling to make the right long term decision.\n\nI’m finishing my Master’s in Data Science next semester. I interned last summer at a big company and then started working in my first FT data role as a data analyst at a small company (I’m about 6 months in). My goal is to eventually move into Data Science/ML maybe ML engineer and end up in big tech.\n\nOption A: Data Engineer I\n* Industry: Finance. This one pays $15k more. I’ll be working with a smaller team and I’d be the main technical person on the team. So no strong mentorship and I’ll have the pressure to “figure it out” on my own. \n\nOption B: Senior Data Analyst\n* Industry: retail at a large org.\n\nI’m nervous about being the only engineer on a team this early in my career…But I’m also worried about not being technical enough as a data analyst and not being technical. \n\nWhat would you do in my shoes? Go hard into engineering now and level up fast even if it’s stressful without much support? Or take the analyst role at a big company, build brand and transition later?\n\nWould appreciate any advice from people who’ve been on either path.\n",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\nI'd really appreciate some career advice. I'm an international student just about to graduate (this December) from Sunway University with a Masters of Business Analytics.\nI'll be applying for the Graduate Pass, which gives me some time to find a data-related job here in Malaysia.\n\nMy Background:\n1. Academics: Masters of Business Analytics.\n\n2. Experience: I have around 4 years of experience with data (analysis, visualization, SQL, Python, etc.) and about 1 year of experience with AI/ML modeling.\n\n3. The Catch: My main concern is that all of this experience is from academic and personal projects, not from a formal industry/internship environment.\n\nMy Questions:\n1. Given my situation (fresh Masters, no professional experience, foreigner on a Graduate Pass), what are the most realistic \"go-to\" job titles I should be searching for?\n\n2. Are roles like \"Data Analyst,\" \"Business Intelligence Analyst,\" or \"Junior Data Scientist\" the right keywords? Is \"Data Scientist\" too senior to aim for right now?\n\n3. Are there specific companies or \"graduate programmes\" in Malaysia that are known to be more open to hiring international students without prior industry experience?\n\n4. How can I best position my 4+ years of project experience on my resume and in interviews to make up for the lack of formal work history?\n\nI'm eager to start my career and am open to any and all advice on how to get my foot in the door.\nThanks in advance!",

I still don't quite understand if it's worth separating them. For example, I have a table with suppliers, sales, region, etc., is it worth separating it into DIM region, DIM suppliers, etc.? Why? Wouldn't it be easier to use everything in a single database? Or is it a matter of creating other relationships and improving speed? Thanks!!",

    "content": "I got laid off twice now, once last August and again today. I was a Data Scientist for 3 years previous role and 8 months data analyst this recent role. I've held off from starting a family because I've been trying to get stable in my career before I take that step, but now that I'm 30. Its getting a bit too late. I want to become a more competitive candidate as I'm having trouble even landing interviews. I've gotten my resume checked many times and changed format about 7 times. I think part of it is because my degree is in MIS and the companies I worked at were small. I'll also admit my python knowledge is intermediate and not advanced but I cant even make it to the interview stages for that to be relevant. My current stats are 2 interviews per 350 applications. \n\nI figured the best way to become more competitive in the market is to gain experience in platforms/software that are: here to stay, and in demand. I've experience with Azure, Aws, Databricks outside the standard data analysis stuff like power bi, jupyter, and Excel. I have zero certifications in anything though.  I'm also looking into a masters to do that is more on the easier side. So recommendations on that would be appreciated.\n\nTLDR: What certifications are in demand and have a good job outlook in the near future that would be worth investing time and money to complete?",

And what have been the pros and cons of each?\n\nIn my case, I’ve been leaning toward specializing in Marketing Analytics, Web Analytics, and Social Media Analytics, but I’m a bit hesitant. I’m worried that by narrowing my focus too much, I might be closing myself off from other areas like product, finance, or operations analytics.\n\nI’d really like to hear from others who’ve faced the same situation:\n\n* Did specialization help you stand out, or did being versatile open more doors?\n* How did you decide where to focus your energy?\n* And if you’re a generalist, how do you keep your skills sharp across different domains?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences!",

    "content": "I led a department as a first-time analytics manager and it was, without exaggeration, one of the toughest experiences of my career.\n\nWhen I joined, there was no analytics team. Everything ran through an offshore agency. My boss had started just a month before me, and there was no real onboarding. I didn’t know which BigQuery tables to use or how the data flowed internally. \n\nOn top of that, the marketing and product teams were already hostile toward each other, which made navigating the department even more difficult. I had to rely heavily on an offshore analyst just to figure out where to start.\n\nFrom the start I noticed the chaos. During a product release an error occurred and I was blamed even though it wasn’t my fault. I took it in stride and immediately built processes and procedures with the offshore team to prevent future mistakes. I automated reports for both marketing and product, tracked campaign performance, new versus repeat customers, channel attribution, year-over-year comparisons, and I even held weekly and monthly performance meetings. I became the go-to person for Google Analytics questions and data troubleshooting.\n\nBut no matter what I did, the product team was frustrated. They thought I was too junior, that I focused too much on marketing, and that I wasn’t supporting their A/B testing enough. When they didn’t trust data from an external A/B testing company, they demanded I migrate and validate it in our database within a week which is a process no one had done before. My boss admitted to me that the timeline was unreasonable but didn’t defend me. Then came the PIP, where they expected me to teach them everything I knew while continuing to question my authority and competence.\n\nThe CTO and my boss constantly emailed me, sometimes in ways that felt like tests, my manager would constantly call me entry-level and not really a manager. Every day felt like walking a tightrope, balancing impossible expectations, politics, and distrust.\n\nLooking back, I realize it wasn’t my work that failed. I automated reports, created processes, and became the knowledge hub. The problem was the environment. Toxic, unsupportive, and political, it turned me into a scapegoat for pre-existing tensions.\n\nThat experience was the straw that broke the camel’s back. It made me reevaluate what I wanted from my career and I ultimately decided I could no longer continue in analytics. I had learned a lot, proved what I could do, and survived a chaos-filled environment, but I knew it was time to step away and pursue something that respected my skills and effort.",

    "content": "Hi there, \n\nI’m currently working as a data engineer at a large tech company for over 3 years. This is my first job after college. I focus on developing and deploying basic operations/hardware classification models to production, monitoring and updating them, and some infrastructure tasks here and there. \n\nMy interests however lies more within marketing data &amp; analytics, hence why I’ve be looking for another job. \n\nI’ve found myself in quite a lucky position where I have two job offers and I’m unsure what direction to go for: \n\n1. Data Engineer specialised in Marketing at a large fashion company. This job would basically focus on marketing from a data engineering point of view: think attribution models, streaming, data quality and some dashboarding. \n\n2. Technical Data Analyst at a marketing agency. This is a less technical role, though it requires SQL and python. I would basically be a data consultant for clients to focus on their marketing data strategy, tracking, a/b testing, data visualisation. \n\nSalaries are quite similar though the data engineer position pays a bit more. \n\nI’m very attracted by the analyst role, but I am scared that it would be a logical step back in my career as it is a less technical role. \n\nFor the engineer role, I think I would appreciate the change of focus and industry. I fear that the role will be very operational and my career progression will be sort of limited to senior data engineer (i.e. becoming more technical rather than strategic) \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? Or does anyone have any opinions on this topic? \n",

I anticipate that higher-ups will want to track more info.\n\nBut many/most of them will not see the problem with having multiple documents and spending hours cross-checking them, or they'll wonder why we can't just keep all the info in one Excel sheet (which would be an improvement)?\n\nIt's not a tech-savvy workplace so I gotta pitch them on why we need to create a real database and how that isn't actually scary and doesn't require extremely advanced IT skills.\n\nI'm rather burnt out from other work I am doing so my mind is blank on how to pitch this.  I feel like it's obvious.\n\nIf you've got the time and the interest, hit me with key points.\n\nTIA!!!",

Talked to my sister who is in an executive tech position and she advised me to consider going to IT audit given my background… I have 3 years experience in IT business analysis and then data science I worked a lot on my knowledge and skills when it comes to tech and data however as I moved now to a different city I can’t simply go back to my home town,I rented an apartment (we only have yearly rent) and bought furniture and settled here… going back is very difficult financially\n\nHere the salary is good, the benefits are not bad but I feel like I was tricked into this by my manger who was not very clear and honest all he says that he wants to have advanced analytics without being transparent has no team and expect me to do everything many people have left him shortly after joining. there is a guy who is leaving after spending 2 months and he is handling almost everything and I’ll take his handover. And tbh doing this is a big downgrade to my career\n\nI have made my mind about leaving this team and this manager but Do you advise me to leave this company now? Note that I don’t have a backup plan yet or I give it a chance and move to actual internal audit mostly IT audit Is it a good career path? Because if I started it I will lock in and commit myself to it fully\n\nOr there is a better option than these? I’m in true need of guidance",

To be honest, I’m a bit clueless when it comes to future jobs but I really enjoy my subjects, and I would like to think I’m good at them. I’m living in London atm and the job market is so competitive and I don’t have any experience in this field as I’ve worked in the restaurant industry since I was a teenager. I worked at a credit union for a few years as well, but I feel like like skills I got there don’t really cross over. \n\nI know the restaurant industry so well. I feel like I could get a job at most places I apply to due to my experience. I really want to feel that way about this new field. Like I said before, I don’t really know where I’m going specifically job wise, and I know it’s completely different from anything I’ve ever experienced. I also know it’ll take real experience in the field to get super comfortable and confident. \n\nI’m required to get a few certifications in uni, but I was wondering if there were any specific things that could really make my resume stand out, or just make me more confident when I get my first job. I know I need to be confident using SQL, Python, and things like R (which I’m not yet). But If anyone has any tips on skills/extra courses/experiences I could get outside on uni and outside of a traditional job that would be sooo helpful. My college counselor recommended Forage for practical practice, and the certifications will come from DataCamp and Coursera. Don’t know how beneficial these will actually be. This field is completely new to me but I really want to do well &lt;3 ",

They usually buy americano which is a strong coffee helping people get through the day.\n\nWhile post 5pm, Latte sells the best. Latte is a popular and comforting choice for those who prefer a less bold coffee flavor, this means people come for dates or meeting friends, basically want to chill.\n\nSo now if you run a cafe and see this trend this is what you can do:\n\n1. In the mornings, until 11 am you can run a combo offer of Americano coffee with snacks like biscotti, donut, bagel (something that pairs well with Americano) this will help you upsell and earn more, while keeping your clients happy at the same time\n2. In the evenings you can run incentivising offers for couples and group of friends on ordering Latte's (buy 1 get 1, or 20% off on select food items)\n3. Music plays a big role (look up why restaurants play music) you can play high BPM music in the morning for runners, corporate crowd. While soft and cozy music in the evening for couples and people who have come to have a good time.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ek9s41mdh9uf1.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d026bc74dd43ad4548cac7c8e2fb48cbb1ebb162\n\n",

However, I am coming to terms that I do not enjoy it and want to switch my majors. I absolutely love working data but my jobs I've held up until now doesn't really require any hard analyzation, just instead the using of it and integrity of it. It's also why I initially thought I would enjoy accounting but I just have not been enjoying what I've been learning which makes it so much harder to retain. \n\nSo, I'm considering either a Data Science degree with an emphasis in Business Analysis or a Business Administration degree with an emphasis in Fraud/Forensics. I know they're completely different but they're the only two things that appealed to me. Realistically, which route would you recommend? Pro is that with Data Science, I would be learning new but harder skills that I don't have so I would enjoy it for the most part, I think. Con is that it'll slightly take me longer. While a business admin degree, I feel like I could leverage my associates degree and the emphasis would help, plus the degree would be done sooner. Con is that I am in my early 30s and had previously filed bankruptcy so I feel that may sway employers from wanting to hire me especially if the majority of roles in my area seem to be in the financial/accounting sector mostly. Plus in the already poor job market, this seems like an even less demanding degree with not the highest pay rates. \n\nSorry for the long post. Just wanted to share as much info as possible, and hoping it'll help you guys provide me with good insights to help me be closer to my final decision.\n\n  \n",

There’s also been a lot of structural change, and I’m still getting used to the stack and business logic.\n\nI genuinely want to improve and understand where I might be falling short, but the feedback feels vague and contradictory to what has been set previously and even for the role. \n\nFor those of you in analytics engineering:\n- Is it common to get feedback like this during probation?\n- How do you usually define or demonstrate “business value” as an AE?\n- Any advice on navigating unclear expectations in a new org structure?\n\nWould love to hear your perspectives, just trying to figure out if this is normal growing pains or a bigger red flag.",

However, I am also a fan of transparent links, so you know exactly where you are going, and have always hated links with a bunch of \"extra\" stuff.

At first it was just me, but now we are a small team consisting of permanent staff as well as fluctuating resources such as external consultants, trainees, interns, etc. and our tools and knowledge gets more and more dispersed. How do you document this in your teams? Any best practices? \n\nI somehow dream about some kind of „analytics playbook“ but at the same time we should as a team improve our pipelines and our analysis.\n\nThanks for any help!",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working as a BI Analyst in Europe for about 3.5 years. Most of my work is closely tied to marketing . I’ve built dozens of Power BI dashboards to track campaign performance, and I regularly work with tools like Eloqua, Adobe, and others. I also spend a lot of time writing complex SQL queries and DAX calculations in Power BI.\n\nSo far, I’ve felt confident in my technical skills and the value I bring. But lately, things have started to feel repetitive, and I’m getting increasingly anxious about the future of analytics roles in general.\n\nBetween the rise of AI and the current market downturn, I keep seeing pessimistic takes online about data and analytics jobs becoming less secure and it’s really getting in my head.\n\nFor those of you in the field, how do you feel about where things are headed? And what do you think are the best ways to future-proof a BI/analytics career and stay in demand?\n\nI really don’t want to become obsolete . ",

Would you use or test something like this?\n2. What infrastructure or data stack would you want it to integrate with?\n3. Any red flags or must-haves for a self-hosted AI analytics tool?\n\nAgain, not promoting anything, just trying to gauge whether this is actually worth building for practitioners.\n\nThanks for taking the time 🙏",

    "content": "For the past 6 weeks, I've been working closely with one of my analysts on a data project; moving one of our legacy Excel dashboards to Power BI. Taking the opportunity for them to upskill with Power BI in the process. I've provided them resources and been supporting them a lot with this project. As part of it, they'll be taking the ownership of producing it and developing it further, taking it off my primary responsibilities.\n\n\nIt's only been about 2 weeks now that they've been actively using Power BI (ever) and today in a meeting with them they showed me what they had done so far to get feedback as we have a meeting to present the progress to our stakeholders at the end of the week. \n\n\nWhat they had developed was messy, on one page there will two charts, the alignment were totally off, the titles were in different formatting and colours. There were some cards on the page, and about 7 slicers many covering the same things (like years and months for each chart individually). The next page was even worse, there were no structure to it, there were about 3 different stories going on at once, singular charts that had nothing to do with the rest, alignments and formatting complelty different to everything else! \n\n\nThese are things you expect from someone that's new to creating data visualizations, and stuff like this takes time, so I gave honest feedback and solutions... But the thing is they were completely adamant that it looked fine. That everything there has a purpose, and while they took onboard somethings like the chart title fonts, completely refused to take onboard everything else, despite me being direct about it. The conversation wasn't confrontational and they didn't seem defensive, it remained an open conversation and ended with us agreeing they'll put some more time in it, tidy it up before they present it to the stakeholders. \n\n\nHow would you have approached this with a junior analyst or someone new to a software or tool? Curious how I could approach a situation like this better in the future.\n\n\nFor context, I develop a small cohort of 4 analysts, I mentor them, provide training and can delegate work to them but I do not directly line manage them.\n\n\nTL;DR - Analyst produced a bad Power BI dashboard and thought it was great, didn't take on the feedback. What's the most beneficial way of moving forward and do better next time?",

As I approach graduating with an information systems degree, I am wondering if this is due to one of the two following reasons:\n\nFirst, more plainly, the job market itself is down, and less opportunities are out there. Second, my theory is that many of the data analyst responsibilities have been absorbed into other positions within company. This may be due to advances in technology (dashboards, AI, etc) or also in part to companies slimming down and consolidating responsibilities. I am curious if this may be the future of data analytics.\n\nIf anyone has any opinion about this, please share. If I am completely wrong, let me know. This is just sort of the impression I’ve been under. Data analyst is a career I’ve been interested in for the past couple years, but if it’s now harder to find a position, then I may try to pivot into something else.",

They can rewrite SQL queries and write Python and stuff like that. But in terms of business logic, they are hopelessly incapable of understanding the core business, or what end users might want. \n\n\nFor example, I constantly have to correct Gemini in order to tell it That what it's doing doesn't even make logical sense. Sometimes it aggregates stuff by calendar month instead of fiscal month and then argues with me about why I am wrong. Then I'll do another chat and it agrees with me and doesn't argue with me. So it's very inconsistent sometimes. Kind of annoying, really. \n\n\nI just personally don't see AI taking over any jobs.

Would love feedback from people living in dashboards every day.\n\n**What analysts get out of it:**\n\n* Cookieless tracking with reliable session metrics (no consent-banner drop-off)\n* Real-time + historical reporting in one place\n* Unified traffic, content, and conversion dashboards\n* Built-in funnels, heatmaps, and experiment tracking\n* AI-assisted insights that surface anomalies before your stakeholders do\n\n**Reporting workflow improvements:**\n\n1. **Ready-to-share dashboards** – export to PDF/CSV or share live links with stakeholders\n2. **Segments without SQL** – filter by campaign, device, geography instantly\n3. **Attribution clarity** – UTM and referral tracking designed for blended campaigns\n4. **Calendar annotations** – log launches, campaigns, outages right on the charts\n\n**Privacy-first foundations:**\n\n* No cookies or fingerprinting by default\n* Configurable data retention windows\n* Event processing stays within the managed infrastructure (no third-party brokers)\n* Full audit trail of data access for compliance reviews\n\n**Tech stack (for fellow data nerds):** Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ + Angular\n\n**Where I need feedback:**\n\n* Which reports consume most of your weekly reporting time?\n* Are there metrics you always rebuild in spreadsheets after exporting?\n* What integrations should be prioritised next (BigQuery, Looker Studio, HubSpot, etc.)?\n* Would you use AI-suggested insights in stakeholder reports, or keep them internal?\n\n**Try the live demo:** analytics.robomiri.com\n\nAppreciate any thoughts on how to make the platform more analyst-friendly!",

    "content": "**TL;DR:** Analyzed **2,076** creatives (**1,006 Meta Ads**, **1,070 TikTok**) across six growth brands (Kitsch, GuruNanda, Curology, ALOHA, Lemme, Touchland). In this sample, **Meta** skews direct-response (offer + CTA early). **TikTok** skews connection/entertainment (creator-led, later/softer asks). Brands that adapt **hook + CTA timing + proof** to each platform appear to perform better on native signals.\n\n**Data &amp; Method**\n\n* Jan 1–May 31, 2025; public ad libraries/feeds only.\n* Tags: hook type, CTA timing, offer flag, format/length, creator presence.\n* Outcomes: public engagement proxies (no conversion data).\n\n**Key Patterns**\n\n* **Intent Alignment:** Meta winners front-load *reason to act* (offer, guarantee, social proof) within the first third. TikTok winners front-load *reason to watch* (curiosity, narrative stakes, “watch me try”).\n* **Hook Portfolio:** Meta over-indexes on **problem/solution** and **testimonial** hooks; TikTok on **demo/narrative** and **situational UGC**. Same benefit, different entry points.\n* **CTA Timing &amp; Modality:** Effective Meta ads use explicit early CTAs (button/copy). TikTok performers push the ask to captions or final seconds, often verbal, not button-driven.\n* **Proof Density:** Meta packs **multiple proof cues** (ratings, before/after, press badge) quickly. TikTok uses **incidental proof** (creator credibility, candid outcome) woven into the story.\n* **Creator Role:** TikTok: creator POV as the *frame* (the brand enters the creator’s world). Meta: creator clips as *evidence*layered into a DR shell.\n* **Format Discipline:** Meta tolerates shorter, tighter edits; TikTok tolerates slightly longer narrative arcs *if* the hook is strong and pattern-breaks reset attention.\n* **Offer Strategy:** Offers matter on both, but Meta leans **explicit offer packaging** (BOGO, % off, trial). On TikTok, overt offers without narrative context underperform qualitatively.\n* **Comment Mechanics:** TikTok posts that seed questions (“which shade?”, “dupe or not?”) show healthier thread depth; Meta relies more on landing-page click intent than comments.\n\n**Limits**  \nSampling bias (6 brands, 5 months), visibility gaps, subjective tagging, no sales data.\n\n# Discussion (would love r/analytics input)\n\n1. Best practice for **intent proxies** when conversions are unavailable (e.g., view-through + save/share weighting)?\n2. A composite **platform-fit score** (hook × CTA timing × proof density × creator role): how would you validate it against downstream metrics?\n3. Any methods you’ve used to separate **creator credibility** from **concept strength** in TikTok performance?\n\n*Independent analysis; no brand affiliations. Happy to share the tag dictionary if helpful.*",

I’m not really sure what I should learn next?\n\nLooking at the needs of my company we definitely need more skilled data professionals who can really build pipelines like this and help transition out of old access databases. Some other teams have started using pyspark and airflow to transition to data lake environments. And some teams are trying out power apps to build new procedures and collect better data.\n\nI feel like I want to provide more value and upskill to keep up with the times.

So far, I've only needed the statistics when studying data analytics, but especially because I don't have experience in the field yet, it would be quite helpful if I could use any or all of the rest as differentiators.

    "content": "I’ve been digging into how to *actually* measure whether AI-assisted content is moving the needle, and I’d love some advice from the r/analytics brain trust. \n\n**Context:** I manage a small Facebook page and I’m experimenting with an AI helper (PostInsight ai) that analyzes past posts, suggests new post ideas in the page’s tone, and drafts reply suggestions for comments. I’m not trying to shill it here — I’m genuinely trying to build a clean evaluation plan and avoid placebo effects.\n\n**What I’m unsure about:**\n\n* **Attribution vs. correlation:** If engagement rises after I switch some posts to AI-assisted drafts, how do you separate lift from seasonality or creative fatigue? (I can tag posts by “AI-assisted: yes/no.”)\n* **Experiment design:** Would you start with a simple A/B at the post level (randomly assign upcoming posts to AI vs. human-only), or do you prefer time-series approaches (e.g., interventional/segmented regression on daily engagement)?\n* **Metrics to prioritize:** Beyond the obvious reach/ER, would you track distributional shifts (comment sentiment mix, question vs. praise ratio), content clustering, or time-to-first-comment?\n* **Sample size reality check:** For a modest page (a few posts/week), what’s a practical horizon to detect lift without the test dragging forever?\n* **Quality signals:** Any lightweight way you’ve used LLMs just for *labeling* (topic, CTA type, sentiment) so the analysis has richer features, while keeping the content itself human-reviewed?\n\n**What I’m planning (poke holes, please):**\n\n1. **Tagging &amp; logging:** Every post gets flags: `ai_assisted`, `creative_type`, `cta`, `publish_time_bucket`.\n2. **Primary KPIs:** ER (reactions+comments+shares / reach), saves, unique commenters, and delayed engagement (24–72h).\n3. **Guardrails:** Pre-register the analysis choices, freeze them for a month.\n4. **Analysis:**\n   * Post-level A/B with regression controlling for hour/day, topic cluster, and media type.\n   * If underpowered, fallback to **interrupted time series** when I flip the “AI usage” rate from \\~0% → \\~50% of posts.\n   * Use comment-level sentiment/topic labels to see if AI-assisted posts *change the audience mix* (more questions? more complaints?).\n5. **Qual checks:** Blind review panel (2 teammates) scoring copy clarity/brand fit so we don’t chase vanity metrics.\n\nIf you’ve done something similar, **what did you measure that actually predicted business outcomes later** (e.g., leads, email subs)? Also, any “gotchas” with FB data access/consistency I should plan for?\n\nSide note: if anyone’s tested tools like PostInsight ai on FB pages specifically (it does post analysis, page evaluation, generates new post ideas, and suggests comment replies), how did you validate the insights before rolling them into your content strategy? I’m happy to share results after I run the first round.\n\nThanks in advance — templates, SQL snippets, dashboards, even napkin math are super welcome!",

    "content": "The idea is simple: you only need a CSV file. The engine is responsible for processing it and delivering it to you:\n\t• 📊 Basic statistics: mean, variance, distribution, outliers.\n\t• 🔍 Anomaly detection: outliers, missing data, suspicious records.\n\t• 📈 Temporal or categorical exploration: trends over time, top categories, comparisons by region/brand/etc.\n\t• 🧩 Clear summaries: structured reports that condense what is important (what happened, what stands out, what could be investigated further).\n\t• 🛠️ Flexibility: we have tested it with datasets from different areas (climate, economy, public NASA data, meteorites, etc.) and it always returns something useful without having to program from scratch each time.\n\nThe interesting thing is that we have already figured it out with real data found on the internet (public). And what it delivers does not remain in theory: it generates reports that we have been able to compare with external sources, finding coincidences and even anomalies that seemed to have gone unnoticed.\n\nIn short, the ULTRA-MINI Engine functions as a mini research laboratory for CSVs, designed to save time and give analysts a solid starting point before entering into more advanced analysis.\n\nI'm not saying that it replaces the analyst's work, but rather that it enhances it: in minutes you can have a report that would normally take hours.\n\n⸻\n\n👉 What do you think?

    "content": "As someone who has been in a perpetual state of pursuing data analytics as a career since 2014, here is my honest, bleak, and unadulterated opinion on the prospects in this field.\n\nIf you think that data analytics will be anything like what you learned in a Google certification program or bootcamp, think again. Being a data analyst is no longer exclusively about providing insights through dashboards or reports. Companies seemingly want someone who understands the full tech stack backwards and forwards and who has deep understanding of ETLs, building pipelines, data architecture, etc. Basically they all want a data engineer who can also do the dashboards and reports.\n\nUnlike other career fields that have a natural progression from junior to senior level roles, the career ladder in data analytics is all but flat these days. Unless you're a data engineer or data scientist who does it all, you're going to struggle finding employment as a run of the mill DA or BI analyst who focuses on reports and dashboards. Those jobs don't really exist anymore as many companies want someone who apparently does everything. The field has been largely consolidated and frankly I don't think we're ever going back, especially with the advent of AI.\n\nUnless you go work for a company that capitalizes off user data and generates revenue from the data, you're likely always going to work on a skeleton crew where you're the only one doing what you do, and treated like a luxury item that most companies don't have the budget for. When times are good, the field may be thriving. But as soon as times get tough, DA teams are usually one of the first orgs to be cut. You will spend most of your time competing for scrap resources with other teams and trying to validate your existence.  Validating the reason for my being has been 95% of my job working as a data/BI analyst.\n\nEveryone wants you to be a master of their DA platforms but managers are hesitant to take chances on you if you did similar work elsewhere on a different platform. In other words, good luck crossing over if your last platform was Tableau but the company you're applying to exclusively uses Microsoft and PowerBI.  Perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of this field is that everyone uses different tools, but hiring managers don't think you're smart enough or clever enough to figure out *their* tools.  I run into this issue SO BLEEPING MUCH!\n\nIn good faith, I can no longer recommend this field due to the lackluster career prospects it offers in relation to other fields. If you like numbers and data, but want stability and an actual career path that provides opportunities for career growth, I would personally point you towards something like accounting or finance. There will be ample jobs at most organizations in either of these areas, and there are actual career paths that one can work their way up by gaining more experience and/or additional credentials.  This is sadly not the case for most DA roles I've held in the past.\n\nGood luck!",

    "content": "(Resume in comments)  \nI graduated in December 2023 with a B.S in Information Sciences from the University of Maryland, College Park. Afterwards, I was unemployed while actively applying to positions for 11 months. In November 2024, I managed to land a part-time job at Wegmans (The in-store customer service kind that sixteen year olds do) and haven't been able to land anything since. I have sent out thousands of applications, I've built a portfolio of machine learning and data projects, got AWS-certified (AI Practitioner), and a bunch of Coursera certifications (Deep Learning Specialization, Google Data Analytics, IBM AI Engineering). I've went to several companies/firms in-person with my resume in hand (at least 10), and they all refer me to \"check on their site and apply there\". I've gone to my local town's career center and they referred me back to their site. I've messaged dozens of recruiters, hiring managers, or people in similar roles on LinkedIn or through email with person-tailored messages to ask about active positions or prospective positions. I've even messaged the Wegmans data team members (at least the ones that have a LinkedIn) and got ghosted by most, and the few that responded just told me to check the Wegmans career site.\n\nI'd appreciate feedback on my resume if possible **(In comments)**, and any other advice that could apply to my career search. For my resume, I tried to emphasize making everything verifiable since so much of the job market has lying applicants (all my projects listed have proof).\n\nA few maybe important things to note:  \n\\- I didn't build a single neural network until I graduated, and all my ML projects have been independently pursued. I've also independently learned PowerBI and kept my SQL skills sharp.  \n\\- As for the positions I'm looking for, I'm applying for any entry-level data-oriented position I can find.  \n**- Please note this is only the base resume I use. I usually tailor my resume based on the position I'm applying for.**\n\n\\- I was CS, but I switched to Info Sci after failing Algorithms (it's an infamous weed-out class at umd, CMSC351). Other than that I have the math core courses down for ML (Statistics, Lin Algebra, Calc II) and coding (Python, Java, C, Assembly, Ruby, Ocaml, Rust, etc.) The reason I don't mention I was formerly CS is cuz it's hard to answer when asked other than saying \"I failed a course and was forced to switch\".\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Note I made a similar post on r/learnmachinelearning, but I wanted some insight from the people here.\\*\\* \n\n&gt;mistake idk",

That second internship inspired me to make a major pivot in my career, which led me to enroll in a Master of Science in Business Analytics program.\n\nAfter graduating, I secured a full-time role in high-stakes customer service, where we handle serious situations and can authorize goodwill gestures of up to $5,000-$10,000. I’ve consistently been recognized as one of the top performers in my department. However, after completing my 30-month departmental obligation (yes, 30 months!), I’ve faced a challenge: whenever I apply for internal analytical roles, I’m told I do not have any analytical experience to continue with the role.\n\nThe frustrating part is that I do have project experience I can show — including models and presentations I’ve built specifically with  company oriented data. I’m familiar with tools such as SPSS, Python, R, RStudio, Excel, SQL, and PowerPoint, though I’m still at a surface-level proficiency.\n\nI feel like I might be too early in my career to break through, and I’m stuck in a cycle where I can’t leverage my degree to gain the experience I need.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for building professional experience outside of my company while I continue trying internally?

Would love a methodology sanity-check (not pitching anything).\n\nSetup (high level):\n\n* Attribution window alignment: per-platform defaults - normalized to a single lookback (e.g., 7d click / 1d view), documented per metric.\n* Cost &amp; revenue unification: currency conversion at ingest (ECB daily rate) - store in a canonical currency; revenue taken from platform-reported conversion value (when present), otherwise mapped from event value.\n* Identity &amp; dedupe: no cross-platform user stitching; treat platforms as parallel channels. De-dup only exact duplicate rows (same day, campaign, platform).\n* ROAS/CAC calc layer: compute ROAS = Revenue/Cost and CAC = Cost/Conversions after normalization; expose both per platform and blended.\n* Change tracking: WoW deltas with a fixed calendar week; rolling 7-day also computed for volatility.\n\nQuestions for this sub:\n\n1. What’s your preferred single source of truth for revenue when platforms disagree (e.g., Meta vs server-side events)?\n2. Any pitfalls with normalizing attribution windows rather than showing native + normalized side-by-side?\n3. Would you compute blended ROAS only after channel-level ROAS passes a data-quality threshold (e.g., min spend/events)?\n4. For multi-currency, do you snapshot FX at transaction day or revalue weekly for reporting consistency?",

I know that there are many companies that can run the whole analytics pipeline really well and this reality is not true.\n\nWe're considering a hands off analytics tool where you can inject a script to do event capture and then on the server side we'll do our magic to process all the data, generate the funnel, and automatically identify paths that are not performing well, what is performing well, possible causes, etc...\n\nThe big question is, from a birds eye view, how does this look to you? Also, do you know other tools that could eventually do this? The big players are focused on very complex cases while this is a more small and medium business approach.

It’s not just building visuals, it includes advisory on what metrics to track, documentation, and handover support.\n\nHere’s what I proposed:\n\n-Hourly (ongoing support): $18 for the first  3 months $20/hr after.\n\n-IF One-time project (dashboard setup + publish online + training + documentation): $2,000–$2,800 depending on scope.\n\nFor context:\n\n- I’m based in the Philippines (so I know some clients expect “cheaper” rates).\n- I have solid experience as a data analyst (SQL, Power BI, reporting, UAT, data cleaning, stakeholder support).\n- I priced it based on the technical nature of the project + training, not just “making charts.”\n\nThe client’s response was: “Well above market rates. Not for us.”\n\nNow I’m wondering:\n\n- Are my rates really above market for this type of project?\n- How do other freelancers in analytics/BI price one-time projects vs. ongoing support?\n- Do clients often underestimate the value of analytics work compared to, say, dev work?\n\nWould appreciate any advice or benchmarks. I don’t want to undersell myself, but I also want to stay realistic.\n\n\n",

    "content": "I got the opportunity to chat with Jonni Lundy, Co-founder and COO over at Resend, the developer-first email infrastructure platform backed by notable investors like Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nResend recently raised an $18 million Series A and I was curious to catch up with Jonni to see how they did it.\n\nAs we were chatting, Jonni emphasized that his mentality during Seed was completely different than what it is now after raising Series A. Especially when it came to the metrics that he was looking at to determine the future success of the company. \n\n* Pre-Series A, everything revolves around one question: \"How many months until we die?\" Your dashboards, your team meetings, your sleep quality - all tied to that runway number, or **burn rate**.\n* After Series A, they rebuilt their entire north star around **ARR per head**. He told us that it wasn't just swapping one number for another - it fundamentally rewired how they think about growth.\n\nNow every decision gets filtered through: \"Will this improve our revenue efficiency?\"\n\nWhat this looks like in practice at Resend:\n\n* Hiring: \"Will this person help us go from $175k to $200k ARR per employee?\"\n* Tool purchases: \"Does this improve our team's revenue generation capacity?\"\n* Feature prioritization: \"Which features help us serve more customers with the same team?\"\n\nJonni mentioned that even with $18M in the bank, they still validate everything with minimal capital first. The ARR/head metric keeps them disciplined and using their resources effectively.\n\nYour metrics aren't just numbers - they're the operating system for your company's decision-making. Choose the wrong north star, and you'll optimize for the wrong outcomes.\n\nFor other founders here who've made similar metric shifts, I'd be curious to hear about what triggered the change for you? Was it funding, growth stage, or something else?",

Make up a follow up report as well.  \n  \nClean the re-recruitment list by removing:\n\n   * Customers who have made purchases again after the list was created (automatic removal).\n   * Customers without an email address.\n* Segment the customers:\n   * Completely inactive customers (no activity at all).\n   * Customers who are active in other product areas but not in the given produc area.\n   * Customers who have only previously made very small purchases (e.g., a one-time order of 500 SEK).\n\n# \n\nWe already have tables and views in Azure Synapse, and they’re synced for use in Power BI.

I have always had interest in analytics and been wanting to move toward a domain expert analytics/mfg support role as to not waste my experience. Also doing online masters in analytics. I was luckily able to land 2 offers for analytics-related roles.\n\nOffer 1: Operations &amp; Analytics Engineer at late stage Energy Startup (500 people) in Bay Area \\~$130k TC\n\n\\-Pros: I like the team and manager alot - seems like good culture fit for me. They care more about WLB, retention and career growth. I'd also be able to live in SF and have a life as I have friends in the Bay and do miss the Cali life. Potential to have 1 day work from home. Potential to IPO. \n\n\\-Cons: work sunday-thursday. Learning curve. Expensive to live in SF.\n\nOffer 2: Operations Engineer (Supply Chain) at SpaceX in Brownsville \\~$170k TC\n\nPros: Bigger name on resume, opportunity after year to switch teams to better site (LA), brilliant coworkers, supply chain seems like promising field for analytics pivot (could get MBA later or access to more roles), free flights to LA every weekend. Stable equity growth. \n\n\\-Cons: Probably high pressure and long hours, probably no-life in remote location, high learning curve, unknown if I gel with hiring manager (he's same age as me) \n\nFor my situation, is it worth to take the SpaceX opportunity for the resume name and \\~40% extra pay? I'd love to enjoy the city life and be back in Cali, but if it is really that much better for my career I think I should take it. If I can survive a year, I may have better exit opportunities or be able to transfer offices. I'd also be saving a lot of money but the role and team at the startup are more appealing to me. \n\nLooking for feedback/advice from fellow engineers or people that have done a similar path!",

This exploration came out of work on a project called *Opendatabay*, but I’m more interested in how the analytics community here has tackled similar problems.)",

We are stuck in the classic problem of drowning in tech debt. They say we want to be agile, but make everything process heavy and standardized. Teams don’t have a choice to choose how they want to work. They say that blame culture is bad but if something had happens the root cause is who did it not why it happened. Lastly, they say they value employees but outsource a lot of jobs and still expect the same output. ",

    "content": "Hi guys I'm a data engineer and I've recently experimented with MMM and Google Meridian. I'm writing this post to share some stuff I've learned in the past two years.\n\nWorking with large marketing agencies and businesses in the EU I've seen them all struggle trying to answer the same question:\n\n*How much revenue is truly being driven by our marketing efforts?*\n\nAttribution models often fall short here, they assign credit but don’t show **incremental impact**, and with cookie restrictions, GDPR, and first-party data limits, they’re becoming less reliable.\n\n**And this is where MMM comes in now.** Originally developed in the 1950s, MMM has made a comeback in digital marketing. Companies like Google and Meta are investing heavily in MMM frameworks.\n\n# Why MMM is Gaining Momentum\n\n* **Direct correlation between spend and revenue:** It answers the ROI question every CMO asks.\n* **Less dependent on first-party data:** MMM relies on statistical patterns, so lost tracking data is less of a problem.\n* **Covers all marketing efforts:** Paid ads, newsletters, TV, website updates—even inventory size.\n* **Works for third-party stores:** Amazon, Etsy, Shopify - you don’t need full control of first-party data.\n\n# MMM vs Other Models\n\n* **Attribution Models:** Track conversions per channel, but often overestimate impact. MMM measures **incremental revenue**.\n* **Media Mix Modeling:** Subset of MMM focusing on paid media. MMM includes pricing, promotions, distribution, and non-media factors.\n\n# And if you want to build an MMM yourself, your best shot is using Google Meridian.\n\nTools like **Google Meridian** make MMM accessible. Key improvements include:\n\n* Accounting for **diminishing returns**.\n* Handling **collinearity** between channels.\n* Modeling **adstock and carryover effects**.\n\n**Pro Tip:** The hardest part isn’t modeling, it’s collecting clean, reliable data.\n\n# Required Inputs for Google Meridian\n\n* **Media data &amp; spend** by channel, geo, and period.\n* **Control variables** (e.g., Google Query Volume, inventory size).\n* **Target KPI** (usually revenue).\n* **Geo population, reach, frequency** for proper scaling.\n* **Organic &amp; non-media treatments** (email campaigns, promotions, price changes).\n\n# Data Prep Tips\n\n* Use **weekly aggregates**.\n* Prefer **geo-level data**.\n* Limit to **5–8 channels**; group excess channels.\n* Avoid biased KPI sources like platform-reported conversions.\n\nI’ve uploaded the training dataset and a sample output from Google Meridian. Feel free to grab them from my Google Drive \\[[LINK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zP8sRgUhN-JSjb6mfhoYZrDTg4QQLZqi?usp=drive_link)\\].\n\nUseful Resources:\n\n* \\[[Google Meridian GitHub repo](https://github.com/google/meridian)\\]\n* \\[[Meridian Demo](https://github.com/google/meridian/blob/main/demo/Meridian_Getting_Started.ipynb)\\]\n* \\[[MMM Data Platform](https://developers.google.com/meridian#use-mmm-data-platform-to-gather-google-data)\\] — this is where you find GQV data",

Obviously I pushed back and said I would more and was offered 2,000 in responsibility allowance taking it to the 26k mark. The job Role and responsibilities did not change one bit, with SQL writing, testing, Power Bi Development.\n\nAfter spending newly 5 months in the role I feel the level of work and the amount of pressure on me is way more than I get paid for, can anyone help me in sharing perspective as I feel demotivated and when I brought this up to my line manager she basically said to suck it up and wait for the next opportunity, but I can’t help be feel hard done by… \nWhat does everyone else think ?

(If you’ve got a better framework, I’d love to learn from it.) \n\n**Goal:** explain *why* certain posts work (copy, visuals, structure), not just *how far* they traveled.\n\n**My workflow (high level):**\n\n* **Feature the copy.** Extract n-grams, reading grade, sentiment, presence of CTA, number of lines/paragraphs, “benefit vs. feature” phrasing, emojis, question marks.\n* **Feature the visuals.** Basic CV tags: brightness/contrast, faces detected, text-on-image %, product vs. people, color palette distance from brand colors.\n* **Feature the thread.** Comment mix (questions, praise, complaints), average reply time, % of comments answered, sentiment shift after brand replies.\n* **Normalize distribution.** Control for reach/time-of-day/day-of-week, paid vs. organic flag, audience size drift.\n* **Model drivers.** Use regularized regression or tree SHAP to rank what moves *engaged rate per reach* (or similar quality-weighted target).\n* **Turn into guidance.** Convert top drivers into simple rules (“Lead with a benefit under 120 chars,” “Avoid low-contrast text overlays on dark images,” “Questions + human face → +X pp engagement”).\n* **Close the loop.** A/B headlines or first lines, then feed winners back into the feature store.\n\n**Tooling:** You can DIY this with Python + Meta’s Graph API (Pandas, scikit-learn, a lightweight CV lib). If you’re non-technical or short on time, I’ve been testing PostInsight ai as a helper: it analyzes Facebook posts + comments, gives page-level evaluations, suggests new post drafts, and even proposes comment replies. It’s credit-based (no monthly plan), which has been nice for ad-hoc work.\n\n**Questions for the sub:**\n\n1. What *content-level* features have been most predictive for you?\n2. Do you model comments/replies as part of “quality,” or keep that separate as community management?\n3. Any pitfalls with image features (e.g., false signals from holiday palettes, product category bias)?\n4. If you’ve built this in-house, how do you present the results so non-analysts actually change their copy/design?",

The idea is to move beyond feature lists and measure what really matters in daily use: **end-user productivity and scalability under real-world conditions**. The benchmark simulates:\n\n* Report/dashbord opening and refresh\n* Filtering &amp; drilldowns\n* Concurrent usage with up to 50 parallel users (for now)\n* Larger datasets with complex calculations (10M+ records)\n\nIt produces a **BARC Benchmark Score**, made of two equally weighted parts:\n\n* **Productivity** – how efficiently and quickly users can complete tasks\n* **Scalability** – how stable performance remains under increasing load and data volume\n\nImportantly: we measure the **performance end-users really feel** (wall times). Backend query times can’t be observed directly – they happen inside the vendors’ systems – so our approach is **black-box testing**.\n\n**First round results (standard cloud tiers):**\n\n* **Qlik** scored 100 (baseline): very consistent, efficient, stable\n* **Power BI** scored 40: adequate overall, but with more variability and long-tail delays under load\n\nPlease don’t shoot the messenger – I didn’t judge, I just measured 🙂\n\n*Full disclosure: I’m one of the authors of this benchmark and developed the overall benchmarking framework, so I’d really value your feedback and perspectives.*\n\nI’d love your thoughts:\n\n* Would such a benchmark help in your software selection?\n* Which vendors or workloads should be included next?\n* How much weight do you give to performance &amp; scalability vs. features?\n\nLooking forward to your feedback – it will help refine and expand the benchmark.\n\n*(If mods are OK with it, I can share the link to the full methodology and charts in the comments.

And I'd be interested to understand also how you're tracking AI traffic? There's loads of good talking points and takeaways. Part 1 will be about 18 minutes long.\n",

I went through the va, other companies that love veterans, career events, indeed, etc. it’s getting to the point where I don’t know if I’ll ever have a job. I’m double majoring in SCM/Finance with this being my final year. I have been unable to get an internship, part- time or full time position. My background as a 92A in the army, along with my calibration engineering job I was at for years. It just seems everyone is posting for jobs, but no one is hiring unless you have 20 years of experience. Honestly if something doesn’t change within half a year or so I know we will be in financial ruin, and my wife and I not having a roof over our head. Doesn’t anyone mind seeing if my resume is really that bad. The hireourheros, va, and school seems to not think so, but at the point it doesn’t matter what they think only what people in the field think.",

    "title": "Floating requirements: Is it time to resign?",
    "content": "I was hoping to receive some advise from more experienced peers, I hope this is the right sub for it.  \nBasically, I joined a company 6 months ago as their data scientist. On paper it was a great fit: strong pay, good benefits, and a culture I admired. At first it was everything I hoped for, but since then things have been going downhill and now I feel like both sides are frustrated.\n\nTo give some context, I’m basically a one-person department. I handle the engineering, modeling, analysis, and visualization, so I’m covering DE, DS, and BI all on my own. I knew that going in and at first it was manageable because my predecessors left behind a solid workflow and pipeline. But unlike me, they were only part time. Somewhere along the way it feels like management decided that since I’m full time I no longer need those workflows and scaffolding.\n\nNow there are no briefs or templates. Instead I spend hours every week on calls with stakeholders where requirements shift constantly, they also tightened the belt and instituted a policy where I actually have to record everything I do on a task management board rather than the other way around. I have very limited visibility on upcoming projects now and I spend most of my time reworking the same deliverables. For example, I’ve been stuck on a single dashboard for six weeks and have gone through more than ten rounds of feedback. I’ve built it to spec three times now, but each time new changes come up and the project is never considered done. Just today I was told to update our core metrics three separate times, each request coming after I had already finished the last version, and of course I missed the deadline the client gave because the asks were outside the scope of what was told to me.\n\nManagement sees me as slow and in need of hand holding. From my perspective they don’t understand how complex their requests actually are. They talk as if making changes is as easy as flipping a switch or dragging in a new field, and they ask questions like “why can’t you just copy what I see on this other platform into the dashboard?”\n\n  \nI also have to catch every mistake my colleagues make because I handle end to end data, so if someone enters the data wrong somewhere, that looks bad on me. I get situations where management decides not to invest into integrating Google data, so I have to come up with a temporary flimsy pipeline to get that in (which I highlighted as being flimsy) which they complain about when it's slow or wrong. I also get things like management deciding to change which platform to use, and them being shocked that....the pipelines don't magically ingest the data to accommodate the new platform.\n\nI’ve considered raising these frustrations directly, but trust already feels fractured. Even before the workflows were removed, the adjustment period was rocky. The last big project I worked on was especially painful. Where they gave me a photoshopped image of a dashboard and asked me to replicate it in Looker with pixel-level accuracy, which is almost impossible to do in that tool. It was frustrating on both sides.\n\nThat said, when projects come through the old pipeline (which some veteran employees still follow), the work goes smoothly and I actually enjoy it. But the stressful periods of shifting requirements and endless iterations are wearing me down.\n\nI’m torn on what to do next. Part of me feels like I should resign and move on, but the current job market makes me hesitate.\n\n  \n",

My manager told me to be curious and I was, but I might have misinterpreted and focused mostly on improving, automating and standardizing our reporting rather than actual business knowledge. To be fair that was my main job coming as an intern and then being the new guy and we have over 20 services that span over 30 countries, my team doesn't specially on any country or region but rather we are in charge of the global view of all the services and monitoring.\n\nMost of the advanced analysis were being done by my senior colleagues and manager as it's requested from the director or high managers and it's always urgent. So in a way it was easier for them to do it than teach me, or let me do it myself (slowly). There is also 0 margin of error and when presenting to the director as you need to have all the facts (direct and indirect info).\n\nMy manager is expecting me to step in more and I am grateful for the opportunity. But I am also terrified. I can do any analysis I am asked but I am slow, while I try to finish an analysis that takes me half a day, my colleagues and manager are doing 3 different ones in parallel with meetings in between. So it makes me feel bad, I know with time I will have more experience and will know how to do them faster. But these past 2 weeks I get the feeling I was so busy, but when I reflect back I feel I didn't do any important. A lot of adhoc requests and when I had the chance to work on a complex analysis I had to ask my colleague for help because I was doing my routine monthly reports.\n\nWhat really scares me is that I feel I will never grasp the business as well as them. My previous experience was more of a general support service so didn't have one industry to really learn from. Now I have to keep track of our business and even know competitors. My colleagues and manager are more of the quick thinking and make connections from many angles. Whereas I am more slow, I need to lay everything out and even then cannot make the same connections. Again, I can do any of the analysis but for some reason things don't stick in my head. Is like numbers are just numbers and have no meaning.\n\nSo question is how did you transition from just reporting to actually having impact in the business? how do you make things connect and how do you keep track of everything that goes around? I really like the job, company, industry and my colleagues, my manager also is very supportive and tries to give me the platform to grow, so I really want to do better and reach their level.  \n",

I am just not sure if it's worth the extra workload when I could be spending that extra time learning extra skills, doing research, and data science projects. I am currently interested in doing work for large retailers (e.g. Walmart, Target) and other large companies like Spectrum. I have done two introductory econ classes up to this point and I enjoyed them enough to want to learn more. I have also done two retail related projects which gave me more exposure to utilizing economic terms like CPI and inflation.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to have the proper experience and credentials so that I can comfortably enter the job market with both a solid education and experience in the field. What would you all recommend?",

    "content": "Hey folks 👋\n\nWe’ve been working on a project that involves aggregating **structured + unstructured data** from multiple platforms — think e-commerce marketplaces, real estate listings, and social media content — and turning it into actionable insights.\n\nOur biggest challenge was **designing a pipeline that could handle messy, dynamic data sources at scale**. Here’s what worked (and what didn’t):\n\n**1. Data ingestion**\n- Mix of **official APIs**, **custom scrapers**, and **file uploads (Excel/CSV)**.\n- APIs are great… until rate limits kick in.\n- Scrapers constantly broke due to DOM changes, so we moved towards a modular crawler architecture.\n\n**2. Transformation &amp; storage**\n- For small data, Pandas was fine; for large-scale, we shifted to a Spark-based ETL flow.\n- Building a schema that supports both **structured fields** and **text blobs** was trickier than expected.\n- We store intermediate results to S3, then feed them into a Postgres + Elasticsearch hybrid.\n\n**3. Analysis &amp; reporting**\n- Downstream consumers wanted dashboards and visualizations, so we auto-generate reports from aggregated metrics.\n- For trend detection, we rely on a mix of TF-IDF, sentiment scoring, and lightweight ML models.\n\nKey takeaways:\n- **Schema evolution** is the silent killer — plan for breaking changes early.\n- Invest in **pipeline observability** (we use OpenTelemetry) to debug failures faster.\n- Scaling ETL isn’t about size, it’s about **variance** — the more sources, the messier it gets.\n\nCurious if anyone here has tackled **multi-platform ETL** before:\n- Do you centralize all raw data first, or process at the edge?\n- How do you manage scraper reliability at scale?\n- Any tips on schema evolution when source structures are constantly changing?",

It was a great learning experience, but the pay was peanuts and I constantly felt undervalued. With wedding prep going on, I didn’t really have time to job hunt, so I figured I’d just move, settle in and find something better in this city with more opportunities.\n\nI’m in the data analytics / analytics engineering space, working with a modern tech stack (dbt Cloud, Snowflake, Qlik, Python, AWS, etc.) and I really thought opportunities would come faster here. It’s been 5 months and I’m just drained. I’ve been putting in all the effort, customizing resumes for every single application, chasing referrals, applying as soon as jobs are posted and still, not a single interview call (plus the added filter of needing H1B visa sponsorship).\n\nMy prior company has told me they’d welcome me back anytime and I really like the team, but moving back to that city and taking that pay just isn’t something I want to do.\n\nI graduated with a master’s in data analytics in 2023 and back then I had multiple offers to choose from. I made a poor choice with the company I joined (the one I left), but at least I felt confident then. Now? I feel like I have nothing. My energy is gone, I’m burnt out. I know the market is brutal right now, but sometimes I wonder if I’m doing something terribly wrong or if my profile just isn’t clicking at all.\n\nThis is partly a vent because I’m exhausted, but I’d really appreciate any advice, tips, or even just hearing from people in the same boat.",

Some of them turned into medium-sized applications that I worked on by myself over the course of a few months. I even tried freelancing on Fiverr and Upwork for a couple of years and managed to get a handful of clients, but not enough to really sustain myself. Watching all the tech layoffs recently has made me feel even less certain about my future in web dev, especially with so many people competing for the same jobs.\n\nWhat got me thinking about analytics was something kind of random — the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game. I used to play a lot and I’d always find myself curious about the connections between cards and how good certain combos were. That curiosity turned into a bigger question: how could someone actually get meaningful data out of all those cards? That’s when I started digging into the entire database, processing it, and analyzing the results to see what patterns I could uncover. It wasn’t just about playing anymore, it was about exploring the data itself, and I realized I really enjoyed the process.\n\nThe part that discourages me now is how often I hear people say the job market in data analytics is saturated. I don’t want to put in all the work to switch fields only to end up stuck again, still working as a line cook just to get by, and taking whatever job I can get that I know I’ll end up despising. Has anyone here actually managed to break into data analytics recently, especially without a degree? And if so, what did you do to make it possible?

    "content": "Hi All,\n\nEver feel like you’re not being *mentored* but being *interrogated*, just to remind you of your “place”?\n\nI’m a data analyst working in the *business* side of my company (not the tech/AI team). My manager isn’t technical. Ive got a bachelor and masters degree in Chemical Engineering. I also did a 4-month online ML certification from an Ivy League school, pretty intense.\n\n**Situation:**\n\n* I built a Random Forest model on a business dataset.\n* Did stratified K-Fold, handled imbalance, tested across 5 folds.\n* Getting \\~98% precision, but recall is low (20–30%) expected given the imbalance (not too good to be true).\n* I could then do threshold optimization to increase recall &amp; reduce precision\n\nI’ve had 3 meetings with a data scientist from the “AI” team to get feedback. Instead of engaging with the model validity, he asked me these 3 things that really threw me off:\n\n&gt;*1. “Why do you need to encode categorical data in Random Forest? You shouldn’t have to.”*\n\n&gt;\\-&gt; i believe in scikit-learn, RF expects numerical inputs. So encoding (e.g., one-hot or ordinal) is usually needed.\n\n&gt;*2.“Why are your boolean columns showing up as checkboxes instead of 1/0?”*\n\n&gt;\\-&gt;Irrelevant?. That’s just how my notebook renders it. Has zero bearing on model validity.\n\n&gt;*3. “Why is your training classification report showing precision=1 and recall=1?”*\n\n&gt;\\-&gt;Isnt this obvious outcome? If you evaluate the model on the same data it was trained on, Random Forest can perfectly memorize, you’ll get all 1s. That’s textbook overfitting no. The real evaluation should be on your test set.\n\nWhen I tried to show him the **test data classification report (which of course NOT all 1s)**, he refused and insisted training eval shouldn’t be all 1s. Then he basically said: *“If this ever comes to my desk, I’d reject it.”*\n\nSo now I’m left wondering: Are any of these points legitimate, or is he just nitpicking/ sandbagging/ mothballing knowing that i'm encroaching his territory? (his department has track record of claiming credit for all tech/ data work) Am I missing something fundamental? Or is this more of a gatekeeping / power-play thing because I’m “just” a business analyst, what do you know about ML?\n\n&gt;Eventually i got defensive and try to redirect him to explain what's wrong rather than answering his question. His reply at the end was:  \n“Well, I’m voluntarily doing this, giving my generous time for you. I have no obligation to help you, and for any further inquiry you have to go through proper channels. I have no interest in continuing this discussion.”\n\nI’m looking for both:\n\n**Technical opinions**: Do his criticisms hold water? How would you validate/defend this model?\n\n**Workplace opinions**: How do you handle situations where someone from other department, with a PhD seems more interested in flexing than giving constructive feedback?\n\nAppreciate any takes from the community both data science and workplace politics angles. Thank you so much!!!!\n\n`#RandomForest #ImbalancedData #PrecisionRecall #CrossValidation #WorkplacePolitics #DataScienceCareer #Gatekeeping`",

I used to know basic Python but haven’t touched it in years.\n\nMy main gap is stats—I’ll need to do controlled experiments, t-tests, power analysis, etc., but I don’t remember much from college. They’ve also mentioned Python/R and possibly some modeling.\n\nWhat should I learn first, and what are the best interactive online courses (like Codecademy) for this? I need to do exercises and tests while I learn them, or else the knowledge won't stick. I'm not great at just reading a book or watching Youtube videos.\n\nBudget isn’t a big issue (up to $400).",

    "content": "I have been struggling with a learning difficulty, no matter what I choose. After completing my arts degree, I prepared for UPSC exam  but switched in May to self-study for a data analyst role.\n\nSince May, I have relied on people to guide me. They gave me roadmaps and told me to ask for help.\n\nThe issue is, I often go through tutorials and plans but can't cover topics properly, which leaves me. I faced this with Python I watched Code with Harry, WS Cube, some bootcamps, and Shraddha's content. I repeated topics but overwhelmed myself practicing questions using Gemini, and eventually, I stopped.\n\nThen I moved to SQL. I created beginner, intermediate, and advanced topic plans over days, watched tutorials like Code Bro and Alex Analyst, and practiced along with the classes. However, I didn't know how to revise. I turned to W3, made notes, and practiced on SQL Zoo, but I got overwhelmed and couldn't write syntax or explain logic in steps. Then, I subscribed to Udemy for Power BI, but after a few classes, I started watching more YouTube videos for simpler explanations. I even asked ChatGPT to explain things in Hinglish, but now I feel seriously overwhelmed.\n\nI’m stuck with SQL. I spent 30 days on it before Python, I did the same circus and it’s been 3 months now. I feel like I can’t accomplish anything in life. Without planning, I can't make progress, but I also can't plan properly.\n\nI seriously not able to make myself progress, not able to ask people help nothing helping me not even ai advice",

    "title": "Breaking into Quant &amp; Data Science from Retail Finance: Advice Needed",
    "content": "I’m 25 and graduated a year ago from university. A few months back I joined a major financial firm on the retail side as a Relationship Banker (RB). I open accounts, process deposits and loans, help with credit cards and other products, and serve as the first point of contact—building trust, spotting needs, and referring clients to the right specialists like financial advisors or wealth managers for referrals.\n\n\n\nI don’t want to stay in retail. I want to move to the corporate/institutional side—ideally into quant trading/developer or data analysis/science. I’m interested in cloud, full-stack, and machine learning, but the quant/data path is what I’m aiming for.\n\n\n\nMy plan: earn Microsoft’s PL-300 (Data Analyst), level up Excel, Tableau, SQL, Python, and C++; read up on data analysis, algorithms, and related topics; build 3–4 projects for a portfolio; then pick up small freelance gigs on Upwork/Fiverr or anywhere I can to start getting paid for the kind of work I want to do.\n\n\n\nI want to leverage my economics degree, front-line RB experience, new certs, and freelance work to move internally into one of those roles (quant trader/developer or data analyst/scientist).\n\n\n\nMy concern is spending 12–18 months grinding and ending up nowhere—learning outdated material, not finding any paid work, or staying stuck on the retail side. I’m willing to put in the work; I just don’t want it to be wasted. For context, I have a bachelor’s in economics and a brief full-stack background with two MERN projects, but no paid dev experience yet.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\n\n1. Can this plan actually work? What should I change to give myself a real shot—through both conventional and unconventional outreach?\n\n\n\n2. Should I start the CFA program to boost credibility, or are there better certifications/certificates/or signs of readiness that show I’m serious?\n\n\n\n3. With AI automating parts of analysis and everything in general, is a 12–18 month push still worth it?\n\n\n\n4. I want to be a quant dev long-term. Is starting as a data analyst a smart way to earn side income and build skills, or should I go all-in on quant from day one? More than anything I want to make this one day be my name source of extra side income, so what can get me there fastest? Or do I need to focus on a specific niche within the space, in which case which one is the most marketable or most in demand, and will be for a while?\n\n\n\n5. If I go the analyst route, which skills are most in demand and most likely to land paid work—financial modeling, dashboards, KPI interpretation, etc.?\n\n\n\n6. Do I need to be a math wiz to learn how to effectively use AI tools in my workflow to be competitive in the field?\n\n",

Meanwhile, everyone else on the team looks super busy with their own work, so I don’t want to seem like I’m slacking , but I also don’t want to come off as “extra” if I start asking around.\n\nI’m worried my manager might eventually see me as not adding much value if I don’t find more work. \n\nShould I start approaching teammates and asking if they need help with reporting/analysis? Or is it better to go straight to my manager and ask if there are projects he’d like me to take on? I was already told by him in the meeting that there might be something coming up in future as we have meeting with higher-up stakeholders but nothing for now.

It makes for a nice, fast experience for users at the kiosk. \n\nAlas, tracking user data has proven to be difficult with Google Analytics and Google Tags for all the above reasons. \n\nWhat we ultimately would like to track is:\n\n* What are people clicking on? (we currently handle that by manually pushing a navigation event to the datalayer in google analytics)\n* Where they are at? (we track that manually)\n* How many users are using it? (We can't track that at the moment, as each kiosk is essentially one user. So we need to do some manual logic to figure that out)\n* User flows (not currently tracking that)\n\n  \nBefore I give in and just roll-my-own solution, is there an analytics product out there that you would suggest that might better serve our particular needs?

Conversions jumped about 8% in two weeks, which honestly beat some of the larger projects we've run. I'd been working with the CRO company Conversion Sciences not long ago, and one of the habits I picked up from them was focusing on the \"happy path\" first before chasing new experiments. That mindset helped me pick the right changes to test.\n\nThe catch was that on certain iOS viewports, the sticky CTA clipped the review stars. So while add-to-cart went up, checkout completion actually dipped. To make it more confusing, GA was showing one story and our ESP another, which made it harder to get a clear read.\n\nWe ended up fixing it by raising the sticky threshold and bringing reviews back into the first scroll. That solved the dip without losing the lift, but it was a reminder that even simple changes can create side effects you don't see right away.\n\nHas anyone else had this \"win then oops\" situation? Do you hold on to the lift and patch later, or do you roll it back immediately and try again with stricter guardrails?",

I’m using MySQL for this because I want to get better with it for interviews and projects. I know i can use other tools to clean the messy data but i want to try doing it using sql but im facing this import issue.\n\nThe trouble is, I have CSV files that contain a bunch of empty strings. MySQL won’t let me import those directly when my columns are typed as INT, DATE, etc. So I thought of two ways but both feel kinda inefficient:\n\n1. Create the table with all columns as `VARCHAR(50) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4`, import the raw data, then *later* clean the data by replacing empty strings with NULL or proper values, and finally convert each column to the right data type.\n\n2. Same as above but instead of replacing empty strings with proper values right away, I replace all empty strings with NULLs first, then work on cleaning/converting.\n\nI’m stuck because both approaches feel like extra work — importing everything as text then cleaning and converting feels like a hassle, especially since I’m still learning.\n\nI’m also wondering if maybe I should just switch to MSSQL since I heard it’s more flexible with empty strings on import, but I really want to stick with MySQL for now.\n\nSo, any tips or best practices for importing messy CSV data with empty fields into MySQL? Am I missing a better way? How do you pros handle these kinds of data issues in real-world projects? Also, if you were me, would you stick to MySQL or try MSSQL instead?",

    "content": "I am currently majoring in BAIT, which is business analytics and information technology (pretty sure my school is the only one that has this). I wanted to minor in CS, and I took the Intro to CS course, which was Java, and I did horribly. I got a C, and admittedly, I didn't try hard enough and didn't consult TAs at all, so that contributed to a bad grade, but at least I passed lol. Anyways, I did it because technology is becoming more and more ubiquitous in society, but I just did not find the class fun. Tech is relevant, sure, but coding was not only hard but also pretty boring. I heard Stats was a good minor (and major and probably better than mine, but whatever), but I took \"Intro to Statistics for Business\" and did poorly. Got a C+. Also did not find the class fun. I LOVE math, but I got scared of a math major, so I did not do it, but I thought stats would be the same, but god no. I found it boring and was unmotivated in the course. I also didn't try in the course, so I got a poor grade. A math minor at my school is pretty rigorous. I'm up for it (kind of, I did AP calc in HS and got a B+ and a 4, so I have a math background), but it's like 10 entire courses and 33 credits, which is genuinely more than some of the majors themselves. I am at a loss. \n\n\n\nI still don't know exactly what I want to do, but I do want to get into this field or a related one. ",

    "title": "How much LeetCode should I do?",
    "content": "Hi, I started out as a CS major but have been inclining towards data analytics and data science roles rather than full-on SWE. I've tried the whole LeetCode and NeetCode grind, but I honestly don't feel qualified for most of those. I know Python and have used it in quite a few of my projects, but there's no way I'm getting a SWE or dev role with my current skillset. The SQL / Pandas questions however I'm much more confident with, and can solve even Hards with ease.\n\nThere seems to be some degree of contradiction. I've been hearing that business/data analytics roles are like memes and often end up being filled by juniors unable to LeetCode well. But then I hear that oftentimes business analysts, data analysts, and data scientists sort of just do the same thing, and the difference rests mainly on pay and status. But then I hear that the hiring processes for data scientists and MLEs are similar to those of SWE but with more ML stuff you need to know, LeetCode and all.\n\nI'm a rising senior in college, so my focus right now is on full-time applications rather than internships again. I've already had a few internships, but they were unpaid, part-time, and kind of jokes, so I'm not sure how much they're going to help me with full-time roles; I've already started applying to those, but so far I haven't even gotten a single interview invite, so not much luck in that department  (yet). I also have an upcoming ML research opportunity, which is also part-time.\n\nI don't know. I just wanna be able to live on my own to some degree and not have to be dependent on my parents. Even if it means having to move out of the NYC area and live in some LCOL region. Thanks.",

    "content": "After auditing dozens of GA4 setups, we kept seeing the same pattern: misconfigured events and hidden drop-offs were costing real growth.\n\n\n\nHere's the process we now follow for any site or SaaS:\n\n\n\n• Map out your key actions (signup, activation, purchase). Don't rely on GA4's default events—define custom events that match your funnel.\n\n• Use the Funnel Exploration report to see where users drop off (pay attention to % complete and step names).\n\n• Track engagement depth: scroll depth, button clicks, video plays. Hidden friction often shows up here.\n\n• Pull event data into BigQuery or Looker Studio to identify anomalies (unexpected parameter values, missing items).\n\n• Compare product usage metrics (feature adoption, retention) with acquisition metrics to find \"aha moments\".\n\n\n\nWe built a simple script to automate these checks (and catch typos in parameter names). If anyone wants to kick the tires, we just opened up about 50 free seats for early testers. You can grab it at askgaai .com (it's free, just a Google auth). Would love feedback from fellow analytics folks on the process – what else do you look at when auditing GA4?",

    "content": "Hi everyone, I’m at a bit of a crossroads and would appreciate some advice.\n\nI am a junior Data Analyst with about one year and a half in a smallish non-tech company, embedded in the sales/marketing department. Overall, my role feels pretty frustrating:\n\n-There’s constant context switching between small urgent ad-hoc requests. The problem is that everything is urgent so it’s impossible to prioritize.\n\n-A lot of these requests is just manual crap that no one else wants to do.\n\n-A lot of deck formatting/power point monkey work where I spend more time aligning logos than doing actual analysis.\n\n-Since I’m the only data person, no one really understands my struggles or can support my tasks, and when something that is easy on paper but tricky to implement, I cannot really easily pushback or manage expectations.\n\n-Due to this chaotic environment, a lot of times I feel very stressed and overwhelmed.\n\n-In summary, I feel more like a glorified commercial assistant or data-ticket monkey than a proper (aspiring) data professional.\n\nThat said, I do get some exposure to more interesting data topics. I collaborate with the central data team on things like dbt models, Power BI dashboards or Airflow orchestration, which has given me some hands-on experience with the modern data stack.\n\nOn top of that, I’m currently doing a Master’s in Data Science/AI which I’ll hopefully finish in less than a year.\nMy dilemma: should I start looking for a new role now, try to get more interesting topics within my org (if possible) or wait until I finish the degree?\nOn one hand, I feel burnt out and don’t see much growth in my current role. On the other hand, I don’t want to burn myself out with even more stress (applications, interviews, etc) when I already have a demanding day-to-day life.\nHas anyone been in a similar spot? Would love to hear how you approached it.",

    "content": "I interned as a Sales Analyst (0-1 YOE) these past few months at a big company but my scope was way more data heavy. During my time I was in charge of migrating the team’s older Access logic into a SQL Server pipeline. Additionally though, I implemented a Snowflake schema with SCD2, cleaned up data quality issues (dupes and missing data), built Tableau dashboards for leadership, and automated Excel reports with Python (couple hour processes down to a couple minutes).\n\nMy team is five people, all mainly in Excel, but I am the only one with SQL, Python, and Tableau skills. That means I would be solely responsible for data management and basically acting as the technical lead.\n\nJust recently I applied for an internal Data Analyst posting which is scoped exactly the same as my recent responsibilities have been. A recruiter even reached out to me, letting me know that HR warned about my case since I was likely converting with my original team. The recruiter removed me from the pipeline for now but told me the door is still open if things do not work out.\n\nNow I got my official conversion offer and it is just “Sales Analyst” like the rest of the team. Pay is about 65k (hourly, not salary) in a high cost of living area, while the Data Analyst band here is 75 to 100k. Manager says they cannot change the title or job code, and pay is not flexible due to budget.\n\nI am planning to accept since it is stable and I like the team, but wondering how others have handled being placed in a lower title and pay band while doing much more technical work. Did you stay and move internally later or did you pivot out quickly?",

    "content": "As a product analytics lead at a small mobile SaaS, we noticed churn creeping up and conversions dipping. Instead of adding more features, we went back to our GA4 data and found that a handful of key events were mislabeled or missing entirely.\n\n\n\nAfter fixing those events, using GA4’s funnel exploration to see where users dropped off, and reworking our onboarding to shorten time-to-value, our conversion rate jumped by 40% and churn fell. We also used Hotjar and Mixpanel for qualitative insights.\n\n\n\nIt took me so long to clean up the events that I built a simple script to automatically flag misconfigured events and track core metrics. Friends asked for it, so I made it public at askgaai .com (there’s a space so the URL doesn’t get caught by filters). It’s free and not a get-rich-quick scheme—just something that helped us.\n\n\n\nThe takeaway: before chasing new growth hacks, make sure your analytics are accurate. GA4’s funnel exploration and cohort analysis can surface leaks and opportunities you might miss. Happy to answer questions and hear your experiences!",

Would anyone be kind enough to provide me with a roadmap how would one come about this as if you were telling your younger self on how to start this data career path. \n\nBecause honestly speaking i've tried reading (huge amount) but a lot of stuff i couldn't understand. I need a clear roadmap as to: \n\n1. Do i need former training to be in this field?\n2. Which industry data falls under?\n3. And do i have to go back to school for this? \n\nAll comments and advice are sincerely appreciated.",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently job searching and one of the option is to pivot from mid-level Data Analyst with product analytics focus into a senior role. My company sells digital services with monthly payments (similar to SaaS), and most of my current work is quite operational:\n\n- Handling support tickets from stakeholders\n- Identifying best/worst performing products\n- Checking how price adjustments affect sales\n- Trying to automate repetitive reporting tasks so I have more time for deeper analysis\n\nI spoke with a senior product manager at my company about what steps I should take to grow, and her advice was basically: “Just keep doing what you’re doing, and after some years you’ll be Senior.” But I don’t believe just repeating the same tasks for 3+ years or even 5+ is enough. \n\nSo, for those of you already working in Product Analytics as Senior Analyst (especially in SaaS/digital services):\n- What types of product analyses should I focus on mastering to move beyond the basics?\n- What challenges or responsibilities set Seniors apart from Mid-level analysts in your experience?\n- Besides waiting, what concrete steps/projects helped you demonstrate Senior-level impact?\n- And how do you communicate like a Senior during interviews?\n\nI got feedback that I don’t know how to “do PR” for my work. In interviews, I usually explain the steps I took in my analysis and the results, but maybe that’s not enough? Am I missing a higher-level way of framing it?\n\nI’d appreciate your guidance a lot. The job market is hard right now so I want to do everything I can .",

That's because no one I've worked with, or reported to, seems to have a clue what's going to move the needle with respect to cost reduction and better patient outcomes. We're all just scrambling constantly to keep up with whatever document of arcane rules that CMS dropped this week. Or we're putting together reports with whatever metrics our partners request, only to send them into the ether and never get any indication that they were read. \n\nIt's all so very frustrating and it's enough to make me want to leave healthcare, except after 15 years, I don't know what else I'm qualified to do. Our (American, in case it wasn't obvious) system is a horrible Gordian knot that nobody seems to really understand, let alone have any ability to improve. But that doesn't stop people from claiming they have the answers; those people usually get promoted to VP before they get exposed as knowing no more than the entry level MPH.\n\nDo you work in healthcare?

The academic market, including academic administration, looks like it is only going to get worse over time so I am starting to look into a bit of a career shift into market research and data analytics. From the outside, the research can look less rigorous than what I've done in the academy (I understand this is largely due to different incentives) but on the other hand I just have little to no experience with the tools used. Learning SQL seems like a good idea. I also see Tableau/Looker on a lot of job postings. Sprinklr also seems to be used for social media analytics positions. \n\nAnyway, for someone who uses STATA/SPSS extensively but doesn't have much experience using anything else how hard is it to learn these tools and what is the best way to learn them? I'm thinking of taking a SQL course at the University I work at. But for Tableau and Looker are there good online resources that would get me pretty proficient in a relatively short amount of time (say three months)? Anything else that you would prioritize? \n\nThanks for any advice. ",

They spit out a result, but we don't get much insight into the model's assumptions, and more importantly, they don't seem to integrate well with other measurement methods.\n3. **The \"Modern\" Stack:** I keep hearing about a more holistic approach (a unified marketing measurement platform), but I'm trying to figure out what that actually looks like in terms of software.\n\nOur goal isn't just to get a quarterly MMM report.

For me, I’d say it’s just being able to ask the *right* question before pulling data.",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a recent BBA graduate trying to start a career in finance/data/business analysis. I know that SQL/MySQL is one of the most important skills for analysts, so I’ve just started learning it.\n\nSince I’m a beginner, I’d like to know:\n\n1. Which specific MySQL concepts are most useful for entry-level analyst jobs? (e.g., SELECT queries, JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, etc.)\n\n\n2. Do I also need to learn advanced topics (like stored procedures, indexing, triggers) at the start, or are basics enough?\n\n\n3. Are there any practice projects or datasets you’d recommend to build confidence?\n\n\n\nMy goal is to become comfortable with SQL for data/financial/business analyst roles, so any advice or roadmap would really help.\n\nThank you in advance!",

    "content": "This might even come off as comedic to some because of how badly I did. I apologize for ranting here, but I am also hoping to get some advice moving forward.\n\nI went into the interview thinking I'd be asked questions based off my resume. I did ask HR if there are any technical or behavioural questions involved (to which they said no), so I basically prepped the common interview questions and research about the company.\n\nThe interview was scheduled for an hour, but in the end I only got asked a few questions, one \"tell me about yourself\", one on projects I did, then after that I got asked (edit: by the hiring manager) how would I use data analytics to predict future sales for the company.\n\nI felt utterly stupid because I could only think that it involves ML and blurted somewhere along the lines of \"regression\". My answers for some of the questions were so poor that they didn't even last for 20 seconds. I barely have any ML background and based on my understanding, the job description only mentioned about Tableau and Excel. (But not pointing fingers here, just felt out of the blue)\n\nBarely 15 minutes into the interview we were already at \"do you have any questions\", and I felt like I was trying my best to salvage it by asking as many questions related to the job/company I could think of but I think I just sounded desperate like a guest who overstayed their welcome. Anyway, it ended under 30 minutes.\n\nI am really hoping to get some advice on how I can improve for the next interview, because my odds of even landing one is extremely slim and I cannot afford to have another slip up. \n\nFew questions:\n1. What constitutes as \"technical questions\" exactly? If an interview involves technical questions, does it usually mean coding on the spot or it can be anything from explaining functions/models/DA methodology? I might have misinterpreted the HR so that's probably why I was unprepared for that question.\n\n2. How do you prepare an answer for an unexpected question, especially for DA where they can basically ask anything from interpreting data / SQL code, or sometimes ML? What's the most efficient way to go about this? \n\n3. (Kind of unrelated to analytics: idk if anyone has been through a similar situation) As a uni student, how do I go about applying for internships/ preparing for interviews whilst also managing my academic workload? I struggle with this a lot, especially interviews would mentally drain me for the whole day and I would spent days preparing for it, which I don't think it's a good use of time as well. (Could be an social anxiety issue so I'm also in the midst of getting that sorted out)\n\nAny advice in general is appreciated, thank you 🙏",

Upskilling in this area can give me leverage as an SEO because I already know how to create pages that rank. Adding in the ability to design wireframes and/or implement them on-page can add more value to what I can already bring.\n\nFor Data... it's a no-brainer. Everything now is tied to data—marketing, business, and especially SEO. There are tons of GuessSEOs that just wing things and have no concrete plan. Being able to cultivate my skills in data analysis can help bridge my capacity to deliver more data-driven insights as well as decisions.\n\nAgain, just want to know what the people in this sub can say about these choices that I have, and would really appreciate it if there's anything to consider before choosing any of these.\n\nThanks in advance.",

    "content": "Hey folks!, I'm dealing with a categorical column (drug names) in my Pandas DataFrame that has high cardinality lots of unique values like \"Levonorgestrel\" (1224 counts), \"Etonogestrel\" (1046), and some that look similar or repeated in naming patterns, e.g., \"Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel\" (558), \"Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate\"(617) vs. others with slashes. Repetitions are just frequencies, but encoding is tricky: One-hot creates too many columns, label encoding might imply false orders, and I worry about handling these \"twists\" like compound names.\n\nWhat's the best way to encode this for a sentiment analysis model without blowing up dimensionality or losing info? Tried Category Encoders and dirty-cat for similarities, but open to tips on frequency/target encoding or grouping rares.",
