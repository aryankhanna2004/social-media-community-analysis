I would appreciate ANYONE that can help me with this! Thank you!",

    "title": "The “Give Me a Quick Fix” frame vs the “Let’s Invest the Time and Energy to do an Excellent, High Quality Job” frame",
    "content": "In L. Michael Hall’s book *Winning the Inner Game*, he contrasts these two frames, saying:\n\n&gt;Playing the frame game of *”Give Me A Quick Fix”* sets into motion a very different kind of set of choices and actions than does the frame, *”Let’s Invest the Time and Energy to do an Excellent, High Quality Job.”* It costs less in terms of time, trouble, and energy if we put some effort into it than if we want to find the easy and quick tricks, “The Path of Least Resistance.”\n\nI see a lot of people looking for help here and in r/hypnosis playing something like “Give Me A Quick Fix.”\n\nThese folks seem to want a solution that is Cheap (Free), Fast, and Good (Effective). In project management this is called the Iron Triangle, and the saying is, “Pick two.”\n\nPosts will ask for “the most powerful” ways to reprogram yourself, but why do they want to DIY their own reprogramming? Usually because they want it Cheap.\n\nBut being able to apply “the most powerful ways” to change yourself first means somebody has to know how to apply those ways to helping other people change. This means either you learn how to be a practitioner or you learn self-application from someone who invested the resources to learn how to be a practitioner. Neither of those come “Cheap &amp; Fast.” Why would they?\n\nWe can match Hall’s example frame games with the Iron Triangle options:\n\n* ***Give Me A Quick Fix***\n   * **Cheap &amp; Fast** (less effective): Ask for a free solution on Reddit, watch Youtube videos, etc. This is actually the slowest when you end up trying to solve the same problem over and over again because the cheap/free solutions aren’t getting you anywhere.\n* ***Let’s Invest the Time and Energy to do an Excellent, High Quality Job***\n   * **Cheap &amp; Good** (slower, takes more effort): Read books, watch how to videos, practice what you’re learning in a disciplined enough way, for long enough, with no expert curation, guidance or support. Blaze your own trail through the jungle of options out there rather than following proven paths.\n   * **Fast &amp; Good** (costs more): Pay a practitioner who has gone through a good training program, or go through a good training program yourself.\n\nIf what you want is **effective change**: the fastest, easiest way is to pay a good practitioner for sessions. These will generally not be the cheap ones.\n\nIf what you want is to **become a practitioner**: the fastest, easiest way is to pay for a good training program (usually more than one, because there’s so much to learn). These will generally not be the cheap ones.\n\nIf you *must* have a Cheap option, realize that this will be generally be slower and take more effort from you. If you choose this path, might I suggest that you focus all of your initial changework efforts first on making the necessary changes required for you to give up “Cheap” and embrace investing in “Fast &amp; Good.”\n\nMaking the change from insisting on “Cheap” to investing in “Fast &amp; Good” may require you to make changes in your environment, your behaviors, your capabilities, your beliefs, your identity, and even your sense of belonging. It may require resolving unconscious objections to the change that are very difficult to see without someone else’s help. After all, if the problem were something your conscious mind was aware of you would just change it.\n\nPersonally, I banged my head against the wall of “cheap &amp; free solutions only” for a long time before I started to invest in pro quality help. And wow, it’s amazing how much easier and effective things got the moment I started paying for good help.",

I first came across this when studying through the UK College of Personal Development, and it made me realize how much of this work is about experimenting, not just theory.\n\nThat said, I still find myself wondering how to use these tools outside of a practice setting. Like, I can sit down and do an exercise, but in the middle of a stressful situation I don’t always remember to apply it.\n\nFor those of you who’ve trained in NLP, how did you make it more natural, so it becomes second nature instead of just something you do in a workshop?",

Now we had 4 session were 3rd and 4th session were what I would call it a psychic attack and invasion.\n\nThe therapy started of normally until a lot of weird things started happening that I couldn't understand back then. 3rd session I remember I dissociated so extremely hard because she was basically using my attention to guide me without my knowledge as I was already in a very bad state of mind. This session I believe she used to test my susceptibility as I almost lost conciousness in that session. She brushed it of like it was nothing and we ended the session. It didn't feel right somehow that I dissociated so hard. It felt like my concious self was completely pushed away and my subconcious mind was widely open.\n\n4th session she basically full on manipulated in her session. She did that mostly by silence. Now because of that this silence has lodged itself into my system and my perceptual field or my face. There was also extremely invasive staring evolved.\n\nAre there any people here that know how I can break this imprint on my nervious system and recover sovergnty over my self. \n\nIt mainly feels like my nervious system has been entrained into some sort of loop. Like I never left that session sort of thing. Like a part (nervious system part) of me is still there constantly reliving it.\n\nPlease help.",

A few months back she went through what is best described as Narcissistic collapse and entered a shame spiral. Building the way back out she now has an issue. \nIn a combat sport, she can beat the men, often very well, but as soon as she is competing in her own gender category, performance drops. Some of the men she beats are world top twenty level. In a training camp this week she struggled to win any matches against any of the women. \nWe've identified significant submodality differences, switching submodalities doesn't stick. Visual squash made some short term progress but then reverted. Double VK dissociation approaches have zero impact. Swish no effect. Resource anchoring doesn't stick, (shame spiral resistance undermines almost every technique). Timeline work has had some positive progress but not a lot. Following a lot of observation I have the feeling that this is going to be a threshold pattern, there will be a moment where her brain has enough of the incongruence and snaps things into a different order. This said I haven't worked with threshold patterns for years, does anyone have a model that would fit the situation?",

The founder/mentor mentioned that *maybe* the client could hire us after the project if they get funding, but there’s no clear assurance from the startup itself.\n\nMy question is:\nShould I straight up ask the founder/mentor if they can give me some kind of guarantee for a PPO (pre-placement offer) so I can prioritize this over placements? Or is that a risky/unprofessional move since it’s a small service-based startup and they may not be in a position to commit?\n\nWould love to hear from people who’ve been in similar situations.

I found a few like Ram Verma, Yogendra Singh Rathore, Vikram Dhar, Anil Thomas, etc.  But am not able to decide. \nYogendra Singh Rathore has good reviews, but he has lots of courses beyond courses in a funnel, so I find it too commercial. But the same is case with few others too. So please suggest a genuine practitioner who teaches well and gives good hand holding for learning. Thanks ",

Then I stew about it for long periods of time. \n\nThis is something I do all day. I am constantly performing this strategy to beat myself and and feel like shit all day.\n\nI would like some feed back on my idea for a self hypnosis fix.\n\nI have kept track and made a list of like 50 or more of these things that pop up on repeat. I thought maybe by creating and induction and bringing up the first of these and and eliciting the \"I used to be two\" position and then doing a map across to place the first memory there instead. Then repeating with memories 2-10.\n\nshould I include stuff like \"keeping the learnings\" from these. or how could I make sure I learn from these mistakes and grow from them instead of just suppressing them?\n\nHow can I create a part that will do this in the future automatically so that eventually I can live without this constant beating myself up and calling myself a piece of shit?",

    "content": "A while back, someone showed me this super basic anchoring technique to deal with nervousness before public speaking. At first, it felt kind of silly—like some self-hypnosis trick—but I gave it a shot. I focused on a moment when I felt really confident, brought it up vividly with all the senses, and “anchored” it by touching two of my fingers together. I repeated it a few times, and surprisingly, I started noticing that doing that little gesture helped calm me down right before speaking in front of a crowd.\n\nIt wasn’t magic or instant transformation, but it gave me this subtle sense of control I didn’t have before. It made me realize how often we react automatically without knowing we can actually rewire some of that.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience with a really simple NLP technique? Is there one you use almost daily without even thinking about it?",

He says how humor = creativity = reframing and he also lists a bunch of reframing techniques related to humor, which I pasted below. Do you guys think this is a reliable understanding of humor? \n\n**1. Change of Scope:**  \n  \n**Space**  \n***Expand frame*** (larger scope) “And the larger context around that is. . . ?”  \n***Shrink frame*** (smaller scope) “And part of that is. . . .”  \n***Change frame*** (different scope) “And something entirely different than that is . . . .”  \n***Perceptual Position (self, other, observer)*** “And how someone else would see this is. . . ?”\n\n**Time**  \n***Prior cause*** (earlier scope) “And that’s because. . . ?”  \n***Consequence*** (later scope) “And the result of that is. . . ?”  \n***Expand frame*** (larger scope) “And if that still picture were expanded into a movie. . . .”  \n***Shrink frame*** (smaller scope) “And the most significant time within that is. . . .”  \n***Change frame*** (different scope) “And a very different time is. . . .”\n\n**2. Change of Categorization** (at the same logical level)  \n***Redefinition*** or ***Redescription*** “And how else could you describe that. . . ?”\n\n**3. Change of Logical Level of Categorization:**  \n  \n**Going to a more general category (higher logical level)** “And that is an example of. . . ?  \n***Meta-frame*** (The prefix “meta” alone has been used ambiguously in the past to indicate ***either*** larger scope or more general category, but “meta-frame” has usually indicated a shift to a more general category, rather than a larger scope.) “And that is an example of. . . ?”  \nThere are *many* possible meta-frames. Some of the more useful and well-known ones that have been described previously are listed below:  \n***Positive Intent*** “And his/her positive intent is. . . ?”  \n***Model of the world*** “And so the way *you* see it is. . . ?”  \n***Learning*** “And what you learned from that is. . . ?”  \n***Curiosity*** “And what was most interesting to you about that is. . . ?  \n***Hierarchy of criteria*** “And what is more important to you than that is. . . ?”  \n***Analogy/Metaphor*** “And that is like what. . . ?” (Metaphor creates a category, and often also creates a *prototype* example for the category.)\n\n**Going to a more specific category** “And that is what specific kind of. . . ?”  \n**Category to example** And an example of that is. . . ?”  \n**Counterexample** (Category to example with negation) “And a time when that wasn’t true is. . . ?”\n\n**Looping between category and example, or between category and subcategory.** These patterns are seldom applicable, but *very* useful when they are, because they are logically “airtight.” Both of these loop between logical levels; the category *includes itself* as an example.  \n***Apply to self*** (applying a category to itself.) “And is that true of what you just said. . . . ?” “You said that you hate complaining; is what you said a complaint. . . ?” (See [*Six Blind Elephants, volume 2*](http://www.realpeoplepress.com/blind-elephants-understanding-ourselves-each-other-p-57.html), chapter 5)  \n***Paradox*** (applying a category to itself with negation) “You said, ‘I won’t communicate with you,’ but what you said is also a communication. . . .” (See [*Six Blind Elephants, volume 2*](http://www.realpeoplepress.com/blind-elephants-understanding-ourselves-each-other-p-57.html), chapter 7)\n\n**Ambiguous Reframing Patterns** (in addition to ***Meta***, or ***Meta-frame***, above) Each of the categories below is an example of one of the previous categories.  \n***Outcome*** Since an outcome can be either a scope of experience (a specific new car) or a category (status), asking about an outcome could shift from one scope or category to another, or from scope to category, or vice versa (four possibilities). And the outcome of that is. . . ?  \n***Another Outcome*** Just as an outcome is ambiguous, another outcome could also yield the four possibilities listed above.  \n***Meta-outcome*** (outcome of the outcome) A meta-outcome can also be either a scope of experience or a category, so again there are four possibilities. (When the prefix “meta” is used in other ways, it is also ambiguous in regard to scope and category.)  \n***“Chunk down”*** can mean either going to a smaller scope or to a more specific category.  \n***“Chunk up”*** can mean either going to a larger scope or to a more general category.  \n***Reality Strategy*** “How do you know that. . . ?” asks for the evidence (the epistemological basis) for their experience. The responder may tell you a category (“That is one of the things my parents told me.”) or a scope of experience (“I saw it happen,” or “It’s in the Bible.”).",

I see people doing business consulting on a regular basis. I see people individually in therapy. I see people I do performance coaching and performance enhancement, and I actually work with clients in education. I see kids on a regular basis. So I'm actively involved in the field, doing one on one and group work with people on a regular basis, and have been doing so for a very, very long time.

    "content": "In Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), anchoring involves associating a specific stimulus (like a touch, sound, or visual image) with a desired emotional state or behavior. When the stimulus is reapplied, the associated state or behavior can be triggered. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n* **Creating the Anchor:**An NLP anchor is created by consciously associating a stimulus with a specific state. This often involves recalling a vivid memory where the desired state was experienced. \n* **Applying the Anchor:**When the stimulus is applied, the associated state or behavior is triggered. \n* **Types of Anchors:**Anchors can be visual (a mental image), auditory (a sound), kinesthetic (a touch), or olfactory (a smell). \n* **Benefits of Anchoring:**Anchoring can be used to:\n   * **Access positive states:** Trigger feelings of confidence, relaxation, or focus. \n   * **Change negative states:** Collapse negative anchors by associating them with positive states. \n   * **Improve performance:** Access specific skills or resources. \n   * **Build rapport:** Create a connection with others by using similar anchors. \n\nSteps to create an NLP anchor:\n\n1. **Identify the desired state:** Decide what feeling or behavior you want to access.\n2. **Recall a vivid memory:** Recall a time when you felt or experienced the desired state intensely.\n3. **Choose a stimulus:** Select a unique stimulus that you can easily apply, such as a touch, a sound, or a visual image.\n4. **Activate the memory:** Close your eyes and immerse yourself in the memory, recalling the sights, sounds, and feelings associated with it.\n5. **Apply the anchor:** As the desired state becomes more intense, apply the chosen stimulus.\n6. **Repeat and reinforce:** Practice the process multiple times to strengthen the anchor.\n7. **Test the anchor:** Once the anchor is established, test it in a real-life situation to see if it triggers the desired state. \n\nCheck out the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpGT7aPM6LM&amp;t=231s&amp;ab_channel=NLPCoaching)",

There's a situation that I have faced multiple times and one person even admitted it before me.\n\nThey told me that I have those vibes where they release all their stress and talk about the deepest fears ans insecurities with me. And I can almost feel beyond that. Thing is, that it is not just random people, colleagues or friends who feel that comfortable around me but also my parents!\n\nMost of the time I feel helpless after listening to them and more importantly, drained. Most of the times, I just observe, observe and observe. I just notice and let them take the lead in the conversation, atleast when not looking at non-work related engagements.\n\nAt work, I have recently started to set boundaries and stop being nice. Didn't realize it was hurting my growth until recently when a sales person taught me assertive communication in a rather funny way! That was the time I realized that I had lost tons of opportunity in this world. I feel in taking action now but also being strategic!\n\nQuestion is, is it my fault that people open up to me? Is this an issue with setting boundaries or something else?",

    "content": "Hi all - I have had a particular phobia for many years. It’s actually what led me to learn hypnosis and NLP. Part of the problem in overcoming it is trying to figure out the submodalities. There doesn’t seem to be a visual component (I have aphantasia so I don’t make mental pictures). And no auditory. So I think it’s just purely a body feeling of extreme fear, panic and dread. The fast phobia technique doesn’t help much since it relies so much on the visual system. I’ve tried EFT when I’m triggered and also energy spinning which help in the moment but not at eliminating the phobia completely. Anyone have thoughts?",

Known far and wide as a devoted worshipper of Lord Shiva, he often sought solace in prayers and meditations. By his side was his queen, Somaprabha, a woman of radiant beauty and unmatched kindness.\n\nOne serene evening, as the golden hues of sunset bathed the palace in warmth, Brahmadatta and Somaprabha sat atop the highest terrace. The gentle breeze carried the fragrance of blooming jasmine, and the world below seemed peaceful and still. As they gazed across the vast expanse of their kingdom, something extraordinary occurred.\n\nOut of the heavens, two magnificent golden swans appeared, their feathers glinting like molten sunlight. Their graceful flight painted arcs of gold across the deepening sky. The king was spellbound. Never before had he seen such creatures—so regal, so ethereal. For a moment, time seemed to pause as Brahmadatta watched the swans gliding effortlessly through the air, their beauty forever imprinted on his heart.\n\nThe sight of the golden swans lingered in King Brahmadatta's mind long after they disappeared into the horizon. He could think of nothing else and yearned to see them again. Determined, he summoned his trusted minister, Sivabhuti, and recounted the marvelous sight.\n\n“Sivabhuti,” the king said, “I have never seen such magnificent birds. I must have them brought to me.”\n\nSivabhuti listened intently, his clever mind already formulating a plan. After a moment, he nodded and replied, “Your Majesty, leave it to me. I shall find a way to draw those golden swans back.”\n\nWith the king’s approval, Sivabhuti ordered the construction of a splendid lake just outside the palace. The lake was an extraordinary creation—its waters crystal clear, surrounded by lush trees and vibrant blossoms. Floating lotus flowers adorned the surface, and the gentle hum of nature filled the air. It didn’t take long for birds of all kinds to flock to this tranquil haven.\n\nSoon, the lake became a paradise for feathered visitors, and Sivabhuti was certain the golden swans would come. One day, while walking by the lake, he assured the king, “The golden swans are sure to visit this lake, Your Majesty. It is irresistible to them.”\n\nKing Brahmadatta’s eyes gleamed with anticipation. “Then we must prepare to capture them,” he declared.\n\nSivabhuti, however, hesitated and spoke gently but firmly. “Your Majesty, may I remind you that such magnificent creatures are meant to be free? To keep them captive would be an injustice. For birds such as these, captivity is worse than death.”\n\nThe king fell silent, pondering Sivabhuti’s words. Though his heart longed for the swans, a sense of fairness and wisdom began to take root. He knew that such beauty was meant to be cherished, not constrained.\n\nKing Brahmadatta listened to Sivabhuti's words, the weight of them settling over him like a gentle breeze carrying truth. For a moment, he remained silent, gazing at the glistening lake and the fluttering birds that had already claimed it as their sanctuary.\n\nFinally, the king spoke, his voice steady and thoughtful. “Sivabhuti, you have always been unafraid to **speak your mind**, even when it contradicts my wishes.”  “Let us leave it to fate,” he said at last. “We will wait and hope the golden swans find their way here. Perhaps they will come, and we can admire their beauty just as they are—free and unbound.”\n\nOne bright morning, as the first rays of the sun kissed the palace grounds, a flutter of gold appeared against the azure sky. The golden swans had arrived, their radiant feathers shimmering as they glided gracefully toward the lake.\n\nKing Brahmadatta was alerted at once. When he reached the terrace overlooking the lake, he stood speechless, his heart soaring at the sight before him. The swans were even more majestic than he had remembered, their movements so elegant it seemed as though they danced upon the water.\n\nThe king’s joy knew no bounds. Word spread throughout the palace, and the people marveled at the beauty of these rare, celestial creatures. Day after day, the golden swans returned, making the enchanting lake their home.\n\nEach time they appeared, Brahmadatta would watch them from his terrace, mesmerized by their grace. In their presence, he felt a profound peace, as though the very essence of their freedom and beauty touched something deep within his soul. Their visits became the highlight of his days, a reminder of the wonder and harmony that nature brings when left undisturbed.\n\nOne tranquil night, as the soft moonlight bathed the palace in silver, King Brahmadatta drifted into a deep and peaceful sleep. In his dreams, he found himself once again by the sparkling lake, and there before him were the two golden swans, glowing with an ethereal radiance.\n\n“We have come to tell you a story,” one of the swans spoke, its voice serene and wise. Before Brahmadatta could reply, the dream dissolved, leaving him intrigued and eager to understand the swans’ cryptic message.\n\nAt dawn, the king rose with purpose and made his way to the lake. The air was fresh and cool, and the morning sun painted the sky in hues of gold. As he stood by the water’s edge, the golden swans appeared, gliding toward him with their usual grace.\n\nTo his astonishment, one of the swans broke the silence. “Call your queen and your minister,” it said in a clear, melodic tone. “We have a story to share, and it is one that must be heard by all of you.”\n\nStartled yet filled with curiosity, Brahmadatta nodded. Without hesitation, he sent for Queen Somaprabha and Minister Sivabhuti, eager to uncover the tale that the mysterious swans were about to reveal.\n\nOnce upon a time, the majestic peak of Mount Kailash echoed with divine wisdom as goddess Parvati, seated in all her splendor, delivered a profound discourse. Her radiant presence captivated the celestial beings and attendants gathered around her, hanging onto her every word in reverence.\n\nAmong those present were two celestials, Manipushpesvara and Chandralekha, whose hearts were bound by love. As Parvati spoke, their eyes sought only each other, exchanging secret glances, their minds wandering far from the sacred words being shared.\n\nNot far from them, two mischievous celestials, Pingesvara and Gunesvara, noticed their distracted behavior. Unable to contain themselves, they began giggling softly, their amusement breaking the solemn atmosphere.\n\nParvati’s sharp gaze fell upon the giggling pair, her divine intuition uncovering the cause of their laughter. She turned her attention to Manipushpesvara and Chandralekha, who were lost in their private dream world, oblivious to the discourse and the goddess herself.\n\nA flicker of anger crossed Parvati’s serene face, and her voice, though calm, carried the weight of divine judgment. “The four of you,” she declared, her tone firm and unyielding, “have disrespected this sacred moment with your frivolity. As a consequence, you shall all take birth on Earth.”\n\nThe air grew heavy with the weight of Goddess Parvati's words as the curse resounded across the sacred grounds of Mount Kailash. Amid the tense silence, an attendant named Dhurjata, overcome with concern, stepped forward. With his head bowed, he spoke, his voice trembling with boldness.\n\n“Goddess,” he implored, “this punishment seems too harsh. Surely, their mistake does not warrant such a fate.”\n\nParvati’s eyes, still alight with divine authority, turned to Dhurjata. Her expression hardened as she replied, her voice unwavering, “If you question my judgment, then you too shall take birth on Earth.”\n\nDhurjata froze, regret and fear mingling on his face. The gathering stood in stunned silence until a wail of sorrow broke the stillness. Jaya, the mother of Chandralekha, stepped forward, tears streaming down her face. Her voice choked with emotion. “Goddess, forgive my daughter and the others.  Show them your mercy.”\n\nMoved by the sincerity of Jaya’s plea, Parvati’s anger began to dissolve, her divine light softening. With a deep sigh, she gently touched Jaya’s head and spoke in a consoling tone.\n\n“Do not grieve, Jaya,” she said. “Their punishment will not last forever. In due time, they shall return here purified and enlightened.”\n\nA sense of calm returned to the celestial gathering as Parvati’s words brought solace.\n\nOne fateful day, the tranquility of Mount Kailash was shattered by the thunderous war cries of the Asura Andhaka and his vast army. Their shadows darkened the sacred grounds as they approached with relentless determination, seeking to conquer the abode of the divine.\n\nAmong those who stepped forward to defend Kailash were Dhurjata, Manipushpesvara, Pingesvara, and Gunesvara. The four warriors prepared to confront the invaders, their hearts steadfast despite the overwhelming odds.\n\nAs the battlefield loomed ahead, Manipushpesvara glanced at Dhurjata with a wry smile. “You always **speak your mind**,” he remarked, his tone half-teasing yet laced with concern. “And this time, it seems you’ve landed yourself in quite the trouble.” Their exchange was cut short as the Asura forces advanced, their roars echoing through the valleys.\n\nLord Shiva himself appeared, his trident glinting with cosmic power.\n\nWith unmatched strength and divine precision, Shiva confronted Andhaka. The heavens trembled as the god’s trident found its mark, striking down the mighty Asura. The ground quaked, the air stilled, and a profound silence enveloped Kailash as Andhaka fell.\n\nThe spirits of Dhurjata, Manipushpesvara, Pingesvara, Gunesvara, and Chandralekha departed to earth.  As they left their Gana bodies behind, these bodies were carefully preserved by the grace of Lord Shiva, placed in sacred chambers deep within Mount Kailash, awaiting the day when they would return to their original state.\n\nAs the swans concluded their tale, a serene stillness enveloped the air. In that moment, King Brahmadatta, Queen Somaprabha, and Minister Sivabhuti, along with the swans, fell lifeless. In an instant, their souls ascended, soaring gracefully towards Kailasa, returning to the divine realm from which they had once come.",

    "content": "So I know metaphors are an important tool for creating change. The way I've learned about metaphors is by telling a story (think Aesop's fables) where I have the other person identify with the story and reach end goal. \n\nBut here's the problem with this method, my metaphors fall flat. It's like the moment I start telling this story people realise I'm telling a metaphor and  even if it's the change they themselves asked for, they unconsciously start resisting to it (even for something as simple as 'eat healthy'). It's as if they think I'm \"influencing\" them and hence they don't want it anymore. \n\nAlso, sometimes I can't go with long fables like stories (business meetings) so then I don't have another way to do metaphors.\n\nSo what am I doing wrong? How do you guys do it naturally and gracefully?",

I went through a breakup that also resulted in the loss of two close friends, and I find myself thinking about them constantly which brings up negative emotions and body sensations.\n\nLast night I went through about 15 memories with these people and imagined myself telling them \"It's time for you to go\" and in the memory they would quietly turn and walk in silence through the nearest door, which I would shut. Then I would imagine whatever room we were in and as completely empty, to clear the energy I guess.\n\nI found this to be kind of helpful, but I'd like to know if there are more powerful techniques to \"cleanse\" memories like this? Essentially these memories have become triggers and I'm hoping to de-trigger my emotions around them.\n\nLet me know what you think, grateful for any tips or exercises. ",

Sometimes I notice the embedded commands when he puts emphasis on them through the tone of his voice, but these are far and few. I'm assuming there's other things going on there that I'm missing.

I burned through like 7 regular therapists last year and decided to go for the unconventional modalities and the type of therapists who don't take insurance at all. The type who can sit for multiple hours with you in one session to get really deep instead of \"whelp your hour is up, see you next week!\" just as you start unravelling and you need to check yourself for the next several days.\n\nThe NLP therapist/hypnotherapist I found via word of mouth cost $6k for a 6 month program package. It's a big financial commitment and I can't just fire her in the middle of the program if we're not a good fit. I hope it's worth it. Something I learned about therapy and mental health is treat it like plastic surgery - don't be cheap or try to save money, go for the best you can find. Trying to be cheap with therapy is like flying to Turkey for a botched nose job. I rather overpay for something that really works, rather than underpay for shitty service that does nothing - because the latter it's better off if you spent nothing at all.\n\nWish me luck, I hope it's worth it.",

Unfortunately, none of these have worked for me so far. I’m also on medication, but it doesn’t seem to be helping either (I’ll be discussing this with my psychiatrist again at the beginning of December).\n\nIf you’re looking to practice your NLP skills and try different techniques, I’m willing to be your subject.

My goal for next year, is that therapists have as topic shame to discuss with their clients, instead of asking them \"How was your week?\" Shame is the complex emotion that comes with feeling not acceptable and lovable for who we are and can have severe impact on our self perception, of what makes us feel acceptable and lovable. It can severly impacts our identity and confidence with the roles we fulfill in life, like at work and in private with friends, family and even when alone.\r\n\r\nI escaped myself by numbing my feelings and emotions, and by overthinking.

    "content": "To those familiar with John Grinder’s work—particularly those who have studied with him directly or who have read *Whispering in the Wind* with appreciation—I have a question: can New Code truly be considered NLP?\n\nI hold deep respect for Grinder’s contributions. His change formats are remarkable, both for their elegance and for their practical efficacy in coaching. However, the more I delve into various NLP texts, the less I see clear alignment with Grinder's approach. Grinder has distilled NLP to its core, eliminating what I might call the 'excess,' resulting in a methodology that feels distinct—perhaps even fundamentally different.\n\nFor some context, my journey with NLP began in the late '90s to early 2000s, when I immersed myself in early NLP works and admired Richard Bandler's unapologetic style. Though his seminars later in the 2000s left me disillusioned, I continued exploring the field through other authors, eventually growing disenchanted.\n\nIn the early 2010s, however, I discovered New Code NLP and came to recognize Grinder's mastery. I even pursued coaching, though, given the overall quality of coaches in Italy, I ultimately stepped back, working only with a few athletes each year. Discovering this subreddit initially rekindled my enthusiasm, yet after some reading, I found myself questioning again.\n\nReflecting further, I wonder if New Code truly belongs to the NLP lineage or if it merely shares a few core presuppositions.",

It seems to be an urge to go, just because she can’t.  She believes it’s something psychological, because she has that issue since she can remember. Health Exams don’t show anything unusual.\n\nI understand some of the NLP tools and methods, but I don’t have the “creativity” to deal with that. Assuming it’s something related to unconscious, does anyone have a suggestion on how to help in this case? \n\n",

    "content": "Here is Richard Bandler's and my take on modelling:\n\n1) Modelling is creating a mathematical model.\n\n2) A model of X is the complete set of all relevant NLP strategies.\n\n3) This means you must be able to do NLP strategies mathematically in the form of cybernetic transformations tables and the TOTE model.\n\n4) Unfortunately, as it turns out a model is too rich. You risk copying submodalities sets that have negative unintended unconscuous consequences.\n\n5) For that reason we stopped with modelling and instead turn to NLP strategy elicitation.\n\n6) If a NLP strategy becomes really important we remove the specific submodalities setting from it to create a NLP technique. Hence modern day NLP primarily works with NLP techniques and nobody does any modelling, including NLP trainers like John Grinder who talk a lot about modelling. It is a lie.\n\n7) Even NLP strategy elicitations is hardly ever done, because in the 54 years that NLP is on the planet most of the relevant strategies have been found.\n\n8) Nevertheless, I have elicitated the following strategies for companies I worked for: a) strategy for social engineering, b) polyglot strategy, c) NLP magick. The first one is a trade secret, but I can share the second one if you DM me. The third one you can see here for a bit: [https://www.nlpmagick.net/](https://www.nlpmagick.net/)\n\n9) Without the use of NLP I developed two major models: ABC-NLP which is a scientific grounded version of NLP. The Neurogram model for braintypes. See: [https://www.neurogram.nl/](https://www.neurogram.nl/)\n\n10) Using real proper mathematical models I have created Bayesian network models for: personality typing, relationships, finding the right football players, predicting football matches, predicting the stock market. See for instance: [https://www.tradingbehaviormanagement.com/](https://www.tradingbehaviormanagement.com/)",

    "content": "I trained as an NLP practitioner in the 2000s. The certificate gathers dust somewhere. For a good while, I hated NLP. Now I kind of cautiously go back and explore some of it.\n\nLet's say that about 5% of NLP actually works for me. Which is not a complaint - I think all communication methods are like that. There is no such thing as a generalized framework for great communication and self-development that works for everybody all the time.\n\nTo my surprise, when I recently gave a swish another try, it helped me get rid of a nasty habit that had been bugging me for 15 years. But whenever I tried the same thing in the past, it didn't work at all.\n\nI don't think that I did it \"wrong\" back then. I rather think that all those methods only work in respect to the person and where they are in their lives. It's like a book that you didn't understand when you were young, and as you revisit it later, you discover meaning and fun without any effort, all by itself. And then some chapters just don't do it for you, and that is fine too.\n\nHere is one crucial bit of evidence - and a great way to annoy coaches and youtube gurus: If you have discovered such a great tool for communication and personal development - why are you still making youtube videos and hanging out in dingy, dimly lit hotel conference rooms? Why are you not living the happy life in a palace?\nWhy did I have NLP trainers who were extremely overweight chain-smokers and obviously not very happy? Why did not a single person in my course solve at least one of their big life problems in over a year? Something is afish here.\n\nThere is no panacea. That's what.\n\nAgain, that is not to say that all those tools have no place. They are overgrown by the weeds of greed, promotion, self-aggrandizement, wishful thinking and marketing, and the pseudoscience and in-group lingo don't do much to help - but something useful grows under that layer of filth.\n\nSo one has to dig a bit deeper.\n\nAs for what works for me - I think it's not one particular pattern, one particular intervention, or even one \"sector\" of NLP (such as sleight of mouth). I won't ever put too much faith in eye access cues, and I certainly won't try to match anyone's decision strategy - but apart from those details, it's about attitude and style. Getting past the rigid patterns. Making stuff my own. Embodying states, moreso than desparately trying to \"work all sense modalities\". Mix and match, get creative. Not even trying to mirror, just being aware that it happens naturally anyway. Not trying to \"read eye access cues\" but just noticing that people do indeed move their eyes when they think hard. Not trying to \"do conversational hypnosis\", but accepting that language is always hypnotic, some styles moreso than others.\n\nI'm a juggler, not an accountant.\n\nWhat are your strategies for separating the wheat from the chaff? What are your red flags when it comes to coaches, gurus and organisations? What do you do to actively find out your favourite interventions?",

I thought I'd post the Free NLP Discord link for the people interested in practicing and or being able to have a community to ask questions for clarification.\n\nI can't tell you how much that helped me connect the dots with NLP. After 17 years of acquiring NLP knowledge off and on, I was able to see how it all worked together and learned more in 6 months than the previous years collecting data.\n\nIt's Free to join. I am passionate about this NLP stuff and would love to share how it started and help teach the basics and beyond before it' all forgotten. This link is set to be permanent but if it disappears just send me a msg and I'll make sure you guys get it. See you in there!\n\n[https://discord.gg/p4vZ6vnv](https://discord.gg/p4vZ6vnv)",

    "content": "Every day, I woke up feeling depressed, believing that my life was terrible and wondering if it might be better if it all just ended. I would get caught up in a spiral of negative thoughts that made it hard to get out of bed and pursue my goals. I felt like nothing mattered. But the truth is, it does matter. My thoughts were distorted, and I didn’t know how to regulate this side of myself. However, by using this technique, along with many other incredible methods, I’ve been able to overcome this distorted thinking. Now, I operate from a place of elevated emotions and focus on taking action towards my goals with clear intentions.\n\n════════════════════════════\n\n🪜HOW TO USE THE LADDER TECHNIQUE🪜\n\n════════════════════════════\n\n1. Write down the limiting thought and rate it from 0-5 based on how much you believe it to be true.\n2. Write down the positive thought you desire and rate it from 0-5 based on how much you believe it to be true.\n3. Then create a thought ladder of new positive thoughts that are more believable until you get to the desired thought and truly believe it to be true.\n\n🪜Example of Thought Ladder🪜\n\n* Current Thought: \"I'm not good at public speaking.\" (4-5 belief)\n* Goal Thought: \"I am a confident and effective public speaker.\" (1-5 belief)\n\n🪜Ladder Thoughts🪜\n\n1. \"It's normal to feel nervous about public speaking.\"\n2. \"I have spoken in front of small groups successfully before.\"\n3. \"I can practice and improve my public speaking skills.\"\n4. \"I have prepared well and know my material.\"\n5. \"I am getting better at public speaking with each opportunity.\"\n6. \"People have told me I have a good speaking voice.\"\n7. \"I am feeling more confident in my public speaking abilities.\"\n8. \"I can captivate an audience with my words and ideas.\"\n\n════════════════════════════════════\n\nWhenever you find yourself spiraling into a specific negative thought pattern, take a moment to write down your ‘thought ladder’ and then gradually repeat these new, elevated thoughts until they resonate as true within you. You only need to write them down once, as this process will help you memorize them. Remember, feeling is the secret. You must truly feel the emotions connected to the thoughts you are affirming.

One is from the therapist training group session at Jim Eicher's house where John and Rich first introduced the concept of Neuro-Linguistic Programming.

    "title": "How powerful is NLP in its most current version? ",
    "content": "Allow me before defining this question more precisely, please, to elaborate on my motives to oppose the potential perception that I am only trying to take shots against NLP for my own amusement (which to be honest was my intention in coming to this sub but has since transformed into actual interest):\n\nI first heard of NLP back when I was studying comparative linguistics from my then girlfriend who was much more interested in neurolinguistics than I was. My favorite part of the field was sociolinguistics in case you care to know. She described it to me as half cult half scam based on retracted works of Noam Chomsky and as her father was an acclaimed NLP instructor in her home town and beyond, I figured that she knowing more about neurolinguistics than me probably meant that she was right. Meeting her father also showed me that he did not have the argumentative power she had and which frankly were a reason I fell in love with her at the time. I was used to bring the most eloquent person in the room and to be the best versed in the art of verbal manipulation back then (amongst first school kids and then students) and people who could overpower me in an argument were absolutely special to me as I felt I could learn from them like normally I couldn't any further. Her father was also a vitalizingly challenging opponent to debate and charming about it too but he was nowhere her level of convincing.\n\nSo, my view on NLP was extremely biased. Today, many years later, I know that while she was absolutely convicing, she still also was wrong about some things. Mainly, she was an agnostic. Not an atheist. She believed that there were no higher power and that somehow imaginary constructs that billions of people attribute power over themselves to, that they still were nonexistent and definitely not bigger powers than a single human. She actually convinced me of that until we split but of course, it's absolute nonsense. There is a lot of unknowns about the powers standing over us but neither the power of imagination nor the power of faith are amongst those. We know both exist and play major roles in how the future of humanity unvolves. I should also have known this but she had an almost magical power when she spoke...\n\nAround a decade aftet our split, I have been hit heavy bx fate more often than I can count and I learnt more than I imagined I ever could in a life time. Blessed be the power of simply allowing your universe to be expanded... I also overcame dogma in literal thousands of instances. I spent five years mentally moving deeply into the cognitive realms of witchcraft, occultism, etc to study and compare before returning a changed person with understanding beyond words. I have seen linguistic programming being used on the level of the whole anglosphere - but I somehow kept telling myself that NLP was not real based on really only my opinion that it isn't actually related to neurolinguistic but that instead all of NLP was psycholinguistics and that it was all faulty. I didn't even have an argument for the latter. It was clearly my mind being scared of the implications of there being real methods to (ignoring ethics here) to influence people's thoughts without them noticing. Today I see that protective mechanism and i know that pretending this can't work only protected a vulnerable spot in my psyche while acceptance of these basic facts has allowed me to get to where I would claim to at the very least have a fighting chance.\n\nSo, my question is: Where on the scale between ineffective scam and full mind control is NLP today?\n\nI hope it's okay if I list a few features / milestones that I specifically wonder about:\n\nAs the name includes programming, do you also use modern algorithmics to bundle brainpower subconsciously? If so then how does NLP prevent identity lapovers within the users' consciousness?\n\nCan you mentally communicate in clear text? I assume not but asking never hurts.\n\nWhat is the level of automation and networking in NLP?\n\nDuring consciousness takeovers, how do you safeguard the target's boundaries not being broken? I'm asking specifically because I am still struggling to detect with certainty at which point subconscious agreement ends and orders are executed only anymore based on automatisms and fears? I'm not saying that control over the latter doesn't have its right place too but I'm speaking more on the level of taking over someone's mind to calm them down when they're having a panic where you want to be minimally invasive for example. Or like when you work on a friend's psyche and you take their alpha status to push something beyond their boundaries. It's always a matter of additional communication that in a bigger application can't be guaranteed - or can it?\n\nIs there any ethical binding involved in NLP? Like for example adhering to the 2021 rules of unity which many faith-based systems use to define a moral baseline. In other words: Can NLP be used to enable sexual and otherwise especially bad crimes or is it like a gun in that everyone best be armed to level the playing field?\n\nCan you edit and delete memories in a target?\n\nHow far do you go with self-hypnosis?\n\nIs NLP text only or does it also include visualization techniques and imaginary ritualism?\n\nCan it be used without major trauma? (This might sound weird but some systems are encoded through specific trauma reactions one needs to experience in order to be able to learn using them. I assume it's not a trait of NLP but I want to be certain because I want no further trauma.)\n\nHow does the NLP community stand towards faith based neurolinguistic exploits like for example defining the communicated source of an information to match the characteristic of that God idea where God's ways don't make any sense to humans?\n\nHow far does \"NLP\" extend beyond linguistics? Are there storytelling techniques too, like establishing certain ideas while seemongly drifting off for only ever just a few sentence to later trigger a short break in conscious processing and anchor those earlier mentioned things as deep facts and from then on reference them to strengthen arguments?\n\nI guess it all comes down to this:\n\nWhere does NLP set the boundaries?\n\nI know that most of the things I mentioned can be achieved under certain conditions. I imagine that being true for fully verbal telepathic communication, too. It's likely just a matter of widening the bandwidth between the individuals to be able to send full text instead of emotional impulses. Regardless, many of these things come at very high prices (often involving traumatic experiences but by far not limited to that) and the rest usually is very challenging to people's imagination of what is possible and what isn't.\n\nI understand of course that NLP is not a form of magick but rather a framework to improve communication - just, improvement can be many things based on perspective. Someone smart and rich might consider it a valuable improvement if something allows them to control those who are poor and just mildly intelligent or beyond that. Those on the other hand would not. So, what exactly is the ethical line of NLP?\n\nAlso: Is there any \"do no harm\" or \"only do as much harm as you truly have to\" rule? Or is just everything fair game maybe? I'm not judging, just asking!\n\nAnd is there an anti-capitalist version of NLP or is it always gated with money?\n\nI think that's more than enough questions for now. I thank you foe reading them all and I hope you find it in you to answer those you know the answer to. Thank you in advance.\n\nSincerely, Freyja",

As a kid my efforts and achievements were systematically ignored by my mother, so the more I took positive action, the more isolated I felt and this gave way to a generally helpless and hopeless feeling.\n\nShe might have given me a dirty look or said I did something wrong, but mostly she ignored my efforts, so any negative voice I think would be my own interpretation of things, thinking \"there's no point\", \"I'm not good enough\", \"I don't deserve good things / to take action for myself\", \"I'm not worth making the effort for\", I'm useless\" etc. but these thoughts are very much far out in the background, it's more of a vague, tired, hopeless feeling.\n\nI would love to flip this feeling on its head somehow using NLP techniques, because sometimes I contemplate or begin taking positive action for myself and it can bring up feelings of it being pointless or that there will be negative consequences, which makes taking action harder than it needs to be. \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas in terms of techniques or success stories involving a similar situation they've overcome and could share it here to help me?\n\nI'm not very well versed in NLP, did a course years ago, so please be gentle, I'm a beginner!",

I was drugged and sexually abused for 5 years by my cousin brother who's 3.5 years older to me, starting when I was 12.5. \nLately I've come to know that my cousin drugged me and hypnotized me it's from a very trustable source which goes with the fact that how I cannot make sense of my reality, have been never been able to think and constantly feel lost wherever I go. What I remember from my perspective of that for 3 years things happened between us consensually (which is weird because I would always say no and he would still go on with whatever he wanted to do and after a while I would give in, my entire body would give out, I couldn't even feel the strength in my arms to be able to push him off, I always feel like I am dissociating as in I'm not quite doing anything much really, it has been this way as far as I can remember. Lately after this knowledge reveal I've started considering how my body would never really stay wet and how I would never (and have never) orgasm, how I would feel like I am constantly pretending to want things and moan even though I felt missing I felt I had to do those things. Everytime he would enter the room I feel like I would lose my will to resist, I constantly also live in the state of imagination, this guy has also made me feel good threating it is to form safe relationships with my family which I've recently found out is not the case. One major problem I have with this is I do not have clear memory of all this starting, ending, as well as clear memories and enough memories of the first 2 years. \nI do not feel guilt or pain or hurt or anger, I feel like I am numbed out. I feel like I am lost in like a mist.\nI don't know how hypnosis can really work in real life, I know people say its only when you want to do what is being suggested to you, but my body and mind still don't respond normally, my mind feels locked whenever I try thinking of what happened with my cousin, and body never really feels pleasure for long enough, if i touch myself my body goes dry again, and i have never orgasmed, and i dont understand what has happened here.

But a full on orgasm?\n\nWould that be possible with the help of sub Modalities and such? What specific techniques could achieve this phenomenon?

    "content": "So, requesting desired psychological responses seemed to come natural to me at a young age. But that's playing down green, up blue. Teenage years I had too much control of peers because, play dough. 20s decided to hop in passenger seat for a while to observe. Mid 20s found out that its a simple pattern of hot buttons until somebody told me that my social mechanisms were NLP. I had never heard of the concept and although I had operated the previous ways I felt a sort of moral corruption and had tried to swear it off prior and had absolutely retired certain mechanisms because I thought they were overpowered. But after being told I was using NLP and looking it up I felt morally bankrupt for doing so and have completely abstained from using any type of influence since. It's been a while since I would even communicate a perspective to another person because I started thinking it was so wrong even to point a person lost in a desert to a source of hydration. Should I return to the game? My main intention is to give others the ability to look through the lens of another's perspective, it may give them the weaponry though and after disarming myself I don't think it'd be the best idea in current social climate.",

I became anxious to lie down to sleep because lying down in my bed evokes thoughts about peeing (it's a vicious circle).\n\nMy bladder is seriously struggling - it's trabeculated (thickened and lost elasticity). The many urologists I've seen cannot explain it because every test comes clean.\n\n### What I tried\nI've tried reanchoring thoughts using the canvas technique - but without success. Sometimes it would just aggravate the spasms.\n\nI accepted the issue, worked through and \"released\" the many thoughts by letting them pass. It would feel great in the moment, but they just come back reinforced.\n\nI did the NLP \"model exercise\", where I kept reinforcing the image of myself with an \"iron bladder\" and seeing myself as the best me.\n\nI meditated regularly to keep my anxiety levels low.\n\nI used warm packs to relax the bladder muscles.\n\nI tried drinking low amounts of water - but I'd get triggers even while dehydrated.\n\nI did belly massages.\n\nI did bladder training.\n\n### Other\nTo my understanding, this is the Pavlovian response. It triggers on thoughts and certain locations.\n\n### What can I do?\nIf you know anything/anyone that could help me finally resolve this issue, please help. This agony is wrecking me...\n\n---\n\nI will keep updating this post if new things come up on my mind.",

    "content": "Recently, I had an experience that's been gnawing at my mind. One morning, after an early rise, I found myself catching some more Z's around 7 am. That's when things took a wild turn.\n\nI slipped into a dream, but this wasn't your average dream. I was lucid - fully aware that I was in a dream state. I decided to bail on the dream, to wake up, check the time, the usual stuff.\n\nBut instead of waking up, my world plunged into darkness. I was conscious, but it was like I was trapped in this void, a complete abyss.\n\nBefore I could bug out, I remembered this technique from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) known as submodalities. In the midst of this darkness, I visualized the words \"WAKE UP!\" in my mind. I tweaked the visualization, making it brighter, bigger, closer, clearer. Can't recall if I assigned it a color, but that's a minor detail.\n\nAnd it worked. I woke up. Checked the time, everything was normal, and I returned to sleep. \n\nSo, that's my story. But it got me thinking - what does this mean about the power of our minds? Can we control our dream states to this extent? And what about NLP - is this a common use of the technique, or did I stumble upon something new?\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts. Has anyone else experienced something similar? What are your theories on what happened?",

    "title": "Tips for navigating your internal experience",
    "content": "I've studied the works of Bandler, Steve Andreas, and many other prominent figures in the NLP community. I always believed most of NLP was bullshit and only scope / category or the meta-model were legitimate since you could rationalize them and actually change your mind about things. These models are just sets of analytical tools for your experience and how you make meaning. I could never really get submodality shifts to work for me, and never in any meaningful way. \n\nLast month, I started Igor Ledochowski's course on self hypnosis mostly out of curiosity and after the first few videos, I realized why submodalities and many NLP patterns never worked for me. (never mind the course itself, I just got something I might have gotten from a hypnosis book had I bothered to pick one up)\n\nThe first section was about managing and gathering your attention. Igor posits that you are not your mind (therefore not your behavior or beliefs) you are your attention. Attention == scopes that you're focused on. Attention at this level is always in first position, perceptual positions at lower levels are where NLP patterns happen. This seems obvious to anyone that has studied NLP. He gave us a couple of exercises on gathering attention, just looking around the room which involved actually looking at details of things then shifting your attention which reminded me of attention training technique in meta-cognitive therapy (I never practiced this for more than a month, and never in tandem with NLP).\n\nThe trick that pushed me over the edge and made things work for me was:\n\ntaking an experience, and asking myself questions that elicited content details starting from very obvious things (eyes closed here):  \n\n- What color shirt am I wearing?\n- What was directly in front of me?\n- What do the backs of my hands look like?\netc.\n- What does the separation between my sleeves and my hands look like?\n\nAfter more and more details, I got a much better image of what I was trying to visualize and instead of a feeling of trying, I experienced a feeling of seeing. From there it becomes very easy to elicit the submodalities, and changing them really does give you emotional shifts! I never thought that focusing on details of the content itself would do anything for me.\n\nThe first exercise in the book Six Blind Elephants now makes a lot more sense (think of an unpleasant experience and list down the scopes in your experience as if you were going to ask your friend to direct a movie of your experience for you, then change scopes until the movie becomes pleasant).\n\nThe biggest result so far has been getting the rolemodel perceptual position pattern to work. It immediately makes me believe something is possible and passes ecology / congruence tests. I merely stepped into an experts body and made the statement \"It's possible for me to learn this\" without any resistance!\n\nI hope this helps other noobies too!\n\ntldr;\n\n1. Collect your attention by looking at things around you. Notice the details and move on to the next object. Do this for like 2 minutes\n2. Select any experience you've had and close your eyes\n3. Ask yourself extremely basic questions about the experience, first eliciting visual content until you're satisfied with the detail of the experience\n4. Elicit the process elements of the experience (submodalities)\n5. Shift submodalities and see how doing that affects your experience",

    "title": "Exercise: Creating a New Reality Tunnel (Map)",
    "content": "  **Highway Technique**\n\n*The following is my creation, not sourced from a book, course, or class.*\n\n**Acknowledgment:** \\- Bandler &amp; Grinder, 1979, *Frogs into Princes page 186, fourth paragraph* \\- \"**And combining NLP and hypnosis is even more interesting.**\"\n\nFor some, hurtful lingering preverbal imprinted memories, anchors, sensations, emotional auto-pilot reactions, and intrusive thought patterns defy standard therapy techniques. Be it perpetual anxiety, unending stress, CANT’T auditory tapes, distrust perceptions, or even a blurred sense of detached reality tranquility (*shock*) imprinted permanently while enduring prolonged rage belt beatings. \n\nOne solution is to identify one or more desired daily autogenerated sensations, which will be created by a series of daily deep meditative trance states over time to slowly build and create an additional new Map of the world that incorporates pre-selected everyday habitual sensations coupled with the NLP timeline technique to reduce status quo anti-change defense mechanisms.\n\n**Interested??????????**\n\n**Step One**. While in a deep trance state, use the NLP timeline technique to visually perceive driving a car and then exiting onto a new mental highway. Imagine seeing the new exit sign in front of you, turning the steering wheel onto the exit, and finally driving on a brand-new section of highway. Look in the rearview mirror and see your old preverbal sensations (*old road representing your old Map*) behind you, slowly getting tinier and fading away (*disassociation*). Incorporate and combine additional preferred NLP techniques or modalities that assist in building and reinforcing this new reality tunnel. \n\n**Step Two**. While imagining driving on your new Reality Tunnel, turn on the car radio, which tells you that getting back on the old highway is possible should life situations dictate (*boundary setting, avoidance of abuse, call to action response, etc.*), which helps allow your current firewalls and Map to construction of an additional alternative grouping of new neurological wiring. In other words, develop a secondary Reality Tunnel (*Map*). \n\nWhile at a rest stop, meditate on allowing several reality tunnels to be seen on your Life Roadmap, which gives both the conscious and unconscious mind options to navigate and drive on either Map. \n\n(*Mental Navigation driving options*)\n\n**Step Three.** Develop a personal mantra to associate with your new highway Map and repeat the mantra daily while in a deep trance. Imagine extending your new highway with each trance/mantra mediation session. \n\n**Example Highway Mantra**\n\n**Breath:** **“**Joyous is the breath.” *Feel the air enter the nostrils, transcend down the throat, aerate the lungs, and expand the diaphragm.* *After a few weeks, normal breathing starts to self-generate, anchored low-level feelings of joy.* *3D block letters spelling out Joyous is an excellent, customized option, as is the background auditory message of “Joyous is the breath.”* Get creative and incorporate your favorite NLP techniques. Optional: Shorten to just one word, “Joyous.”\n\n**Heart****:** **“***Wonderous is the beating heart**.”* (*Focus on one’s heartbeats.* *Eventually, individual sections of the heart will be felt separately.*)  (*Feel one’s muscles when exercising)*  \n\n**Water****:** **“***Quenching is life-giving water**.”* (*Drinking cold water while repeating this mantra component intensifies the effect*.) Optional: Shorten to just one word, “Quenching.”\n\n**Muscles:** **“**Rapturous muscle movement.” (*Demonstrative expression of spiritual energy*.) The combination of the visual three D letters of “Rapturous” and an auditory feed intensifies the neurological wiring of positive sensations. Optional: Shorten to just one word, “Rapturous.”\n\nSilently repeat subcomponents of the mantra during everyday activities. I.e. “*Rapturous”* while lifting weights at the gym.\n\n**Results**\n\nThis routine eventually generates habitual sensory responses throughout the day. While standard introspection therapies do wonders, occasionally, talk therapy fails to deliver relief. Since a new-mental-build concept does not rely upon any previous foundations, the mind can choose either imprinted Map. ",

For example:    **Territory and Pre-Human Instinct.**  In my opinion, the basic seeking out and guarding of environmental survival resources, which includes relationship ranking and tribal status, is very likely located in the PAG.  The periaqueductal gray, or PAG, is an area of gray matter found in the brain stem and midbrain and finally stretches out as communication extensions into our forebrain. The PAG surrounds the cerebral aqueduct (hence the name periaqueductal) and occupies a column of brainstem that stretches about 14 mm long.  The PAG can literally hijack conscious thoughts which then leads humans to do things such as declare war on other countries, enslave people, start mean girl games in High School, politically polarize countries, and endless variations of seeking out and preserving desired assets and social standing.

I know sounds like a red flag.\n\n'''Let me have you comments or report after 7 days and every other 7 days.. would like to hear from you \n'' what does he/she mean.\n\nHow to train the intuition?\r\nNotice intuition is derived from 3 major directions – what you see, hear and feel.  So to train the intuition  , is to increase the use of these 3 major senses. Spend 30 mins each morning doing the following for 30 days:\r\n1.\tVisual – in 10 mins, observe quietly 10 people out in the open ie supermarket or shopping mall or coffee house.. check them out, watch their dressing, feel into them as they are speaking, see them move, speak and interact with other people.  See how they behave and see beyond their behaviour, their POSITIVE intentions. Then give ONLY a POSITIVE label to this person; eg: an valued organiser, a content creator, a superb interactor, a creative influencer… etc. whom you think they are.  \n\n\r\n2.\tAuditory – go to a park or mall.  For 10 mins, sit quietly close your eyes and listen… notice the sounds and voices of people or birds or any living thing.  Hear and notice how far they are, its volume, pitch, any distortions, try to identify what those voices, sounds or noises are - who or what kind of personality that person or living thing has.  And give it a positive label, eg: an inquisitive bird, a person in love, etc.\n\n\r\n3.\tKinesthetic – take your phone record some conversations of people daily.  Go back home., in 10 mins listen to all the conversations.  Feel into the things and ways those people are speaking.  Feel into the words and tonalities and identify 5 types of feelings each person is going thro in the conversations.. eg happy, frustrations, anger, irritation, unsettled, unfair, calm, relax, exuberant…etc.\r\nDo it daily only for 30 mins and if you are really earnest in doing it, you will see your intuition raise to very high levels.",

    "content": "A friend of mine whom I've known since we were 6 years old (we're now in our mid-30s), has been up front with me about he uses manipulation, NLP, even magick-al practices (that's a whole other story) in order to get what he wants in life. He's told me it's how he got and keeps his current partner. It's how he's gotten his college degree and jobs, etc.\n\nI have wanted to think he wouldn't do the same to me, but I'm almost certain he is, and if that's true, I feel incredibly offended and taken advantage of.\n\nI'm wondering if you in the subreddit can help me ascertain if some of these things are indeed NLP techniques; also, if they are, what are good methods to be strong against such techniques...and is it worth while to confront my friend about his use of these?\n\nIt's often such small and *seemingly* inocuous stuff. \n\n**Examples:**\n\nHe never asks me if I want to hang out...it's always something like \"We definitely need to hang out and talk about all this. You want to meet me at three, yes?\"\n\nHe never uses question words like \"what, how, 'do you'\" etc... It's always a statement like what he wants me to assent to with a question mark. \"You'll call me after your done with work?\"\n\nThe mirroring is intense, also. Even down to certain interests and such. Not long ago I took the MBTI personality test and he told me initially he was an INFP. After I told him I was an INFJ, he said he took the test again and 'Ope!' turns out he's an INFJ too. \"No wonder we're so similar, our brains are literally on the same wavelength, like we share each others thoughts and dreams.\" he said.\n\nHe has told me before that he mainly uses magick through dream work. That he will project himself into my dreams.\n\nSimilar to the MBTI test, he also mirrored when I said I felt more like an introvert...previously he said he was an extravert and loved being with people. Now he says he's an introvert and prefers to stay at home and play music and read...curiously my main ways to relax as well.\n\nAnyway, are any of those things, especially the way of phrasing questions and statements, and the mirroring, typical of NLP? And are there good ways to shield oneself against that?\n\nOr do you think I'm just being a bit paranoid and looking into this too much?\n\nI appreciate any thoughtful suggestions and analysis.",

    "content": "  \n\nHow a person feeds one’s lower brain components or sub-modalities seems to greatly affect the efficacy of NLP techniques.  I think of providing my mind with raw data before the human filtering firewalls/filters, etc. From what I can gather, language is processed into what NLP authors describe as a digital feed, which makes sense. In other words, language is an excellent indication of essential human experience, but it is still not an original, very old brain data feed. Noam Chomsky's book \"On Language\" describes theories in depth.  Chomsky updated his theories by replacing Surface Structure with Phase Markers, which I took as a bit closer to pure human truth. I experimented with a few meditation exercises offering my subconscious hypnotic suggestions to imprint before my human firewalls. I could view modalities in what felt like pre-conversion to digital and pre-screening of filters. Meditatively came to me that humans probably have a fair amount of core instincts that would have been in place before humans developed the capacity of language. Chomsky wrote quite a bit about how humans eventually developed language ability. Whether real insight or just my imagination, I sensed starting to connect with some of the base original human instincts.  I now imagine just how vital it is to consciously select motivating images and auditory sayings all day, 365 days a year. ",

    "title": "Emotionally Re-Mixing Memories while in a State of Trance",
    "content": "*The following is my creation and not from an NLP book or class.*\n\nContrary to popular belief, personality traits are not locked in by 1st grade. While most individuals’ personalities remain the same, change is possible. In 350 BC, Aristotle taught his students that virtuous traits such as bravery are obtained via the repetition of brave acts. Re-Mixing Traumatic Memories exercises focus on harnessing intense hurtful memories and re-fashioning them into lasting energized structural personality changes. (*Also called Memory Re-Consolidation in the field of neuroscience*) For example, old hurts can be transformed into a personality that bonds, loves, and protects like a pit bull or whatever selected personality traits are chosen. ***Intrigued?*** If so, the following motivational and emotional modification tool may be what you seek. \n\n**Associated Information** \\- From Frogs into Princes 1979 - page 186, fourth paragraph - \"**And combining NLP and hypnosis is even more interesting.**\"\n\n**Why mixing works****:** After a recalled memory is vividly re-experienced, the human mind re-saves the images, which usually slightly alters the memory. The key to emotional re-mixing is introducing new information while memory plays. Reflective pondering or discussion long after the brain hi-jack has occurred may provide intellectual insights. Still, a future-triggered memory will replay with the exact modalities and intensities despite newly learned intellectual insights. The stored memory has a start button like a short video clip and is not directly connected to intellectual insight knowledge. Techniques such as timeline visualization of putting troubling memories behind yourself work because the mind tones down the associated emotional response. Dissociation techniques are beneficial, and a head-on tool for harnessing the intensity of disturbing recalled memories by imprinting new additional information that can drastically alter emotional responses and core beliefs to obtain empowering positive outcomes. \n\n**Re-Framing and Emotionally Re-Mixing Images like a DJ Exercise**\n\n**Step One.** While calm and in a creative state of mind, brainstorm and think of various empowering additive counterwords to bind with current triggers or past troubling traumas.  *Counterword examples**:*  “Remaining Determined,” \"*Brave,\" \"Alpha,\" \"Loving,\" \"Empowering,*\" “*Relentless*,” “*Confident*”, *etc*.  *Problematic Example*: Fear of Public Speaking. *Counter word:* *“Energizing”.* \n\n**Step Two.** Envision your empowering counterword by itself in 3D block letters.  I prefer white letters with thin black lines, but any color will do.  A block letter with imagined sides seems more potent than standard print letters, but both typesets imprint on the subconscious mind.  \n\n**Step Three.**  Relax into a calm trance state.  Trance induction usually only happens in perceived safe places, so please find a safe setting that works for you. Even deeper states of trance and stronger counter subconscious imprinting in settings such as a sauna, hot bath, hot tub, quiet forest, or quiet beach setting. Vacations provide new settings for more profound and more powerful imprinting.  *i.e., sunrise on a beach.* \n\n**Step Four.**  Carefully remember the problematic example or traumatic memory and quickly visualize the empowering 3-D counter letters in the top center of the image while the memory is replayed.  Also, imagine the 3-D counter words as if they are in front of the picture. As if looking into a room and seeing the counter words first.  Placing the letters at the beginning of the small video-type clip speaks powerfully to the subconscious and alters the emotion associated with the traumatic recall.  *Notation**:* *For some, visualizing and hearing the counter word imprints more effectively on one’s in-breath or out-breath.* \n\n**Step Five.**  If possible, add the counterword auditorily while visualizing. I.e., \"Loved\" while the 3-D letters are being visualized.  \n\n**Step Six.**  Focus on incorporating the associated counter-word kinesthetic sensation.  I.e., trigger a remembered trauma and imprint a past sensation of a loving moment meant to help your subconscious respond differently to past cues and triggers.  \n\n**Step Seven.** Imagine the 3-D counter letters expanding in size to tell your lower brain feeling components that you are growing emotionally in a positive direction. \n\n**Step Eight.** Imagine powerful feelings such as being loved upon feeding into the mix. I feel the most effect of the sensation of a positive emotion entering from my left side of the frame.\n\n**Step Nine.** Use an enjoyable song that seems somehow associated with the fill-in-the-blank issue and let it become background audio like in the movies. Sometimes, music can magnify the emotional re-consolidation process.\n\n**Step Ten.** **Recall the newly** **Re-Mixed Memory when triggered or approaching a stressful situation****.** I hope this is helpful.  😊",

An affect approach is closer to the final truth.   Much of his theory surrounds lower-brain learning and integration into upper-brain cognition.  NLP feeds lower-brain regions either enrichment or corrective images, for starters.  Now that I have a deeper understanding of cognition, I seem to be much better at picking and selecting emotions that dovetail with goals.  Pankseepp does not use the words \"NLP\", but gives NLP a bullseye rating and suggests to his colleagues that Memory Reconstruction be incorporated into mainstream therapies.   Pretty neat reading to experience that type of validation for NLP.  ",

It completely does away with the concept of genius).\n\n2) Unconsciously assimilate patterning. Hahaha, what complete BS. This is a magick sauce recipe. No-one has any clue how to do this. If you achieve anything the reason is this magick recipe and if you fail well then it is your fault for not following the recipe.\n\n3) Practice in parallel context. Well nobody is against practice. Given that step (2) is complete bullshit. So far we have: find anyone who is good at something and practice what they are doing. Brilliant! Haha, you have just been sold to imitate someone. And that is it. This is by the way they whole course.\n\n4) Conscious / unconscious dance in order to find a way of coding. Haha, even more bullshit is being sold. Another magick recipe where you are at fault if it fails because nobody knows what this means and it could mean anything. As you just demonstrated.\n\n5) Testing. Ah, it makes sense again.\n\nSo basically John Grinder is selling you and extremely simple strategy:\n\n1) imitate someone 2) test whether it works. 3) if not try again. Basically the TOTE model.

Still, Furthermore, none of the family members who said no to a money grab were given a choice to remain emotionally connected.   The lure of a large amount of money started competitive greed which usually destroys relationships.

    "content": "From Frogs into Princes 1979 - page 186, fourth paragraph - \"**And combining NLP and hypnosis is even  more interesting.**\"   I have been experimenting with combining NLP with deep hypnotic trances to further personal enrichment goals.   Current goals are increasing workout intensity, reducing comfort food intake, and building cognitive flexibility when making everyday life decisions.   I future pace an enriched version of myself doing fill-in-the-blank goals while in deep trance states.  Results:  same waist size as when I was 17, mild increases in strength and definition, and perceiving options to life obstacles and stressors instead of automated responses.  Since entering deep trance states can take a while for many people, this technique is probably not suited for most therapy sessions but can help those attempting to reach certain performance levels.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

    "content": "**I am wondering if anyone knows of NLP based models or training for mindfulness, lucid dreaming or astral projection?**\n\nThe only trainings I'm aware of which touch on any of these topics are: \n\n* Taming the DMN (forgot the website it's from). Describes how to shut off the part of the brain responsible for creating mind-chatter (Default Mode Network) through external sensory awareness, \n* Michael Breen's free webinar on the monkey mind and Mindfulness which he talks about DMN and \"mental tasking\" but doesn't provide a clear instructions or criteria for formulating proper \"mental tasks\".\n* Igor's \"Beyond Self-hypnosis\" is a great course on meditation (introspection), on accessing a deep meditative state, which can help with astral projection and lucid dreaming. But is not intended nor covers the topic I mentioned. Plus, I am looking for a NLP model of these abilities which is more overt installation than covert/hypnosis installation. \n\nI am asking because I am currently modeling these subjects and experimenting with different protocols myself. I have a basic theory for these phenomena and general outline for cultivating these abilities. So I'm curious to see if there's any other works on these subjects from an NLP perspective to compare my ideas to and see if they have something different. Thanks in advance for the replies. ",

Then when you go to sleep and time passes, the oil diffuser goes off according to the time and hour you set it on and unconsciously you smell that scent and subconsciously you \"run your built in program\".

    "content": "Short version: How would you create a rubric for effectively watching and integrating the material from Richard Bandler's NLP-Eternal?\n\nI'm interested in signing up for Richard Bandler's NLP-Eternal. I would like to alternate between his later stuff (which I'm told is better in the sense that he's further developed his techniques and refined his teaching approach) and his older stuff (which I'm told is better in the sense that he is often more explicit in describing things).\n\nSo my question is how to prioritize what I learn first and integrate. I can see this being a long-term learning project because there are over 35 seminars listed alone, so watching it and actually practicing it all will take some time and energy. I think it's worth it because repetition further ingrains things, and each seminar is going to be a bit different. But I'm not quite sure where to start or what would be a logical order to go through that content.\n\nSo any suggestions for creating a rubric for myself? I'd love any insights any of you might have, either from having gone through NLP Eternal itself, or from your experiences with Richard or his material.",

    "content": "I have this completely absurd fear of being photographed. I dont know exactly how it started but certainly around 9 years old onwards. I head aunts who are very appearance conscious and did not like the way they looked in photographs. They would cut their photographs out of group photos if they did not like them. I also went through an incredibly ugly duckling phase and was not included in many group photographs. But I can't be sure what the exact root cause is.\n\nIt is an issue from a practical perspective - eg photo ID, passport, work entry cards but also on a personal level it is an issue as I dont really have any memories.\n\nI cannot join in social media and I also think when nasty people find out about my dislike of being photographed they bully me and deliberately try and take photos of me in unflattering angles, which does not help me one bit, if anything makes my plight worse.\n\nI have looked into several practitioners who say they think they can help me but then cover themselves with results aren't guaranteed etc. I'm looking at putting up almost £1000 for the course of sessions, so can't really make the gamble!\n\nI wonder if any of your experience you've had success with this specific fear and if so which technique did you use or any technique that you would recommend.\n\nI did try my favourite technique which is the phobia cure, but it's not really a phobia. It's more a fear, an uncomfortability, an inability to relax when in front of a camera or if someone is photographing me.",

    "title": "Effective Body Language Mirroring",
    "content": "Mirroring is the first hypnotic skill everyone should know.\n\nIt’s incredibly easy, teaches important habits, and it is sufficient to induce sleeping trance. If you aren’t getting amazing results, you aren’t doing it right.\n\nBefore I knew what mirroring was, I remember being at home on a video call with my parents and noticing they had the same laugh. They would start laughing at the same time, their eyes would crinkle in the same way, and when they finished laughing they would both relax and breathe out in the exact same way.\n\nAfter we logged off for the night, I started to wonder if this was part of the reason old couples look so similar. Not only do they eat the same food and share the same environment for decades, but they also start to share the same expressions and mannerisms.\n\nI pulled up Google Chrome to do some research and I learned a few things:\n\nPeople match body language unconsciously all the time- to signal friendship, comfort, and alignment. If you’re excited, I’m excited. If you’re incredibly happy, then I’m incredibly happy with you and for you. Or if you’re hated, if you’re not accepted, then I’m just as much of an outcast as you are.\n\nIt’s a deep and tribal feeling that might be called *connection* or *rapport*. It’s a real feeling that people really enjoy.\n\nI also learned that the principle of treating your acquaintances like your friends applies here as well. If you mirror with people that you’ve just met, you’ll begin to feel connected in ways that you never have before.\n\nAfter I learned all this, I started to try mirroring in the real world, and I learned things that weren’t online so I could bring them back to you.\n\n\\---\n\nThe goal when mirroring is to come into perfect sync. You move when they move, with the same duration and speed and in a way that’s complementary to their movement.\n\nIf they pull something to themselves, you pull something to yourself, with the same speed, start and end.\n\nMimicking static body language like someone’s posture is effective, but coming into full dynamic sync is incredibly powerful and represents the pinnacle of mirroring. You can attain this by learning the signs of when someone is about to move, and practicing regularly.\n\nUse your peripheral vision. Most of the large body language movements will be visible without you staring directly at them, so just notice them in your periphery and adjust accordingly.\n\nWhen you arrive somewhere, arrive in the body language of the person you’re mirroring. If they’re sitting in a relaxed manner, don’t sit and then mirror, make it all one movement and sit directly as they are. This works especially well for making a first impression.\n\nOn natural movement in general, you’ll have to use your best judgment. If someone is using energetic hand gestures as they speak, don’t repeat those as they’re talking, but if you’re talking about something with a similar energy later, then do the same sorts of gestures. Beyond best judgment, you’ll need a dancer’s sense of movement. Move smoothly, don’t compensate for mistakes, and just relax.\n\nAbove all else, have the other person’s best interest at heart. You’ll naturally feel more connected with them by the mirroring, so allow yourself to feel that strongly and enjoy interacting with another human being with a whole vibrant inner world just like your own.\n\n\\---\n\nAfter I really started to develop my understanding of mirroring I had a new power to affect people around me. People listen to people they like, and they took my words more seriously. If you want the power of influence and you’ll use it for the good of the people around you, consider following me on [Substack](https://appliedpsych.substack.com/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AppliedPsych101) and I can teach you more.\n\nOr if you’re not sure about the effectiveness of mirroring, go out and try it. Don’t try it once, try it until it works, and when it does, come back and find more things to try.",

I seem to be having a very hard time visualizing new and creative ideas.\n\nRecently I tried to design the backyard garden and could not visualize it.   I could get the \"feel\" of the desired garden -  flows, peaceful, birds, green, sunlight - but not the actual visualization (which trees go where for a balanced design and privacy screen).  Repeated attempts have not helped.\n\nThis is concerning as I used to be better at this and have always been a creative type.  Am wondering if scrolling through Google, watching TV,  scrolling through the phone the last few years is making me a passive rather than an active thinker.  i.e. Looking at garden designs vs imagining garden designs. \n\nI'm almost always stuck in \"subvocalization\" mode - internal dialogue.  It's been nearly impossible to get past that when reading and come up with a visualization.   Same when listening.  Also struggle with visual memory esp. when drawing.\n\nHoping there are some NLP techniques that can help shut down the subvocalization and get me into visual mode.   (internal and external).Thank you",

I'm not  posting this comment because i saw a random video or post that said that  NLP is pseudocience. (the wikipedia source cliché).\n\nI  have a lot of experience reading bs (thanks to my mom and my grandpa). I  recently found a book about NLP that my grandpa had, that's how i  started to do my research about it and within a few days i understood  why is a pseudocience.\n\nAnd  actually i'm making an article about it with sources and everything in  order. (BUT, let me finish it then say whatever you want.)\n\nIt's  funny how after NLP was found not to be as effective as it was  proclaimed, the bad arguments started to raise within it's community.  Instead of accepting that the meta-model was wrong.\n\nAnd  i'm basing my affirmation with the definition of pseudocience by Mario  Bunge and how the new redefinitions of NLP contradict the original model  made by it's creators (what i call \"unsolved contradictions\") and how  the lack of neurological explanations make the metamodel \"incompetent\"  to be a source of solutions (Still don't know how autism enters NLP).\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

But if he “senses” that somebody gave him a dirty/angry look, was not friendly or ignored him it triggers him with feeling of Anger and Fear. He says a public confrontation is like his worst nightmare. \n\nHe says that even a facial expression from somebody can trigger the anger and fear, no thoughts are involved just the trigger and instant physical reaction. He says he feels it mainly in his chest and throat. \n\nConsciously he knows it’s silly and would rather laugh it off and ignore it but he feels his subconscious just takes over. \n\nThe reasons i say he “senses” is because most of the time the people aren’t even angry or dislike him. He says their have been times he would get angry and fearful from somebody he “thought” didn’t like him or was angry with him. And that once he talked to them they turned out to be friendly…..he says that the anger and fear he was feeling instantly disappears when he realizes it was all in his head. \n\nHe says if this happens with his brother or mother the feeling are even worse. But with his father or sister he is way calmer and doesn’t get those feeling if there is an argument. \n\nHe was also bullied as a kid. He says he constantly thinks negative and is always looking for dangers. \n\nAny suggestions?!?!\n\nCheers!",
