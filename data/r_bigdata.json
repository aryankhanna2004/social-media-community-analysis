Transfer learning helps build smaller, domain-specific models that can reduce costs significantly. **Data science and AI** go hand in hand. So, in the future, we can see hybrid models that leverage both deep learning and better reasoning and flexibility for various applications.\n\n**4.  Democratization of Data Science**\n\nData science is an incredible technology, and everyone should benefit from it, not just large organizations with huge resources and skilled **data science professionals**. As we enter the future, we find many user-friendly platforms that help non-technical professionals or “citizen data scientists” build models without core **data science skills**. This is a great way to promote data literacy across organizations. However, it must be noted that true success can be achieved with collaboration between domain experts and professional **data scientists**, not alone.\n\n**5.  Sustainability and Green AI**\n\nA huge amount of energy is spent running and maintaining large **AI models**. This is why Green AI has become important. It refers to energy-efficient training, model compression, resource optimization, etc., to minimize energy consumed. According to Research and Markets, the Green AI infrastructure market is projected to grow by $14.65 billion by 2029 with a CAGR of 28.4%. This **data science trend** is all about moving towards smaller, smarter, and sustainable AI systems that offer strong performance with minimal carbon footprint.\n\n# Impact of Data Science Across Industries\n\nThe applications of **data science and AI** across industries are also evolving. Data science is known to be the foundation of innovation in nearly all industries today, and in the future, it will be further strengthened.\n\n**Here is what the future of data science in different industries will be like:**\n\n# Healthcare\n\n* Predictive analytics and AI-powered diagnostics will help detect diseases earlier.\n* Personalized medication and treatment\n* Better patient outcome\n\n# Finance\n\n* Detect financial fraud in real-time\n* Algorithmic trading\n* Personalized financial guidance\n\n# Manufacturing\n\n* Predictive maintenance\n* Better productivity\n* Efficient supply chain\n\n# Retail\n\n* Better customer service\n* Dynamic pricing\n* Forecast demand accurately\n* Inventory management\n\n# Education\n\n* Adaptive and personalized learning\n* Better administration, and more\n\nSimilarly, data science also has a huge impact and will continue to transform other industries as well.\n\nWith proper training and **data science programs**, students and professionals can learn the essential data science skills and knowledge that will help them get started or advance in their **data science career** path for a secure future ahead.\n\nIf you are looking to grow in this career path, here are some of the recommended **data science certifications** that you can look for:\n\n* Certified Data Science Professional (CDSP™) by USDSI®\n* Graduate Certificate in Data Science (Harvard Extension School)\n* Professional Certificate in Data Science and Analytics (MIT xPRO)\n* Certified Lead Data Scientist (CLDS™) by USDSI®\n* IBM Data Science Professional Certificate\n* Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Scientist Associate (DP-100)\n\nThese are some of the most popular and recognized **data science programs** to start or grow in a data science career path. With these certifications, you will not just master the latest **data science skills** but will also be updated on upcoming [data science trends](https://www.usdsi.org/data-science-insights/the-future-of-data-science-emerging-technologies-and-trends) as well.\n\n# Summing up!\n\nThe future of data science isn’t just about building bigger models or handling big data. It is about building smarter, specific, and energy-efficient systems. Data science professionals alone cannot bring the transformation organizations need today, and therefore, they must collaborate with domain experts and leaders to bring vision into reality. Moreover, with user-friendly data science tools, even non-technical professionals can try their hands on and contribute to innovating their organizations. To further strengthen data science capabilities, data science certifications and training programs will be a great help.",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nHere's a case study I thought I'd share. A US-based aerospace/defense firm that needed to migrate massive data loads *without* downtime or security compromises.  \nHere’s what they pulled off: [https://ascendion.com/client-outcomes/90-faster-data-processing-with-automated-migration-for-global-enterprise/](https://ascendion.com/client-outcomes/90-faster-data-processing-with-automated-migration-for-global-enterprise/)\n\nWhat They Did:\n\n* Used Ascendion's AAVA Data Modernization Studio for automation, translating stored procedures, tables, views, and pipelines to reduce manual effort\n* Applied query optimizations, heap tables, and tightened security controls\n* Executed the migration in \\~15 weeks, keeping operations live across regions\n\nResults:\n\n* \\~90% performance improvement in data processing &amp; reporting\n* \\~50% faster migration vs manual methods\n* \\~80% reduction in downtime, enabling global teams to keep using the system\n* Stronger data integrity, less duplication, and better access control\n\nThis kind of outcome sounds fantastic if it works as claimed. But I’m curious (and skeptical) about how realistic it is in *your* environments:\n\n* Has anyone here done a similarly large-scale data migration with AI-driven automation?\n* What pitfalls or unexpected challenges did you run into (e.g. data fidelity issues, edge-case transformations, rollback strategy, performance surprises)?\n* How would you validate whether an “automated translation / modernization tool” is trustworthy before full rollout?",

    "content": "Hello all,\n\nRecently, I've been investigating the best ways to handle prompts efficiently with large-scale AI systems, particularly with configurations that incorporate multiple sets of data or distributed systems.\n\nSomething that's assisted me with putting some thoughts together is the organized method that **Empromptu ai** takes, with prompts essentially being viewed as data assets that are versioned, tagged, and linked to experiment outcomes. This mentality made me appreciate how cumbersome prompt management becomes as soon as you scale past a handful of models.\n\nI'm wondering how others deal with this:\n\n* Do you utilize prompt tracking within your data pipelines?\n* Are there frameworks or practices you’ve found effective for maintaining consistency across experiments?\n* How can reproducibility be achieved as prompts change over time?\n\nWould be helpful to learn about how professionals working in the big data field approach this dilemma.",

Almost every time, they’d have to hand it over to DevOps, the backlog would grow, and overall throughput would tank.\n\nSo I built [Burla](https://docs.burla.dev/), the simplest cluster compute software that lets even Python beginners run code on massive clusters in the cloud. It’s one function with two parameters: the function and the inputs. You can bring your own Docker image, set hardware requirements, and run jobs as background tasks so you can fire and forget. Responses are fast, and you can call a million simple functions in just a few seconds.\n\nBurla is built for embarrassingly parallel workloads like preprocessing data, hyperparameter tuning, and batch inference.\n\nIt's open source, and I’m improving the installation process. I also created managed versions for testing. If you want to try it, I’ll cover 1,000 CPU hours and 100 GPU hours.

    "title": "Growing Importance of Cybersecurity for Data Science in 2026",
    "content": "The data science industry is growing faster than we can imagine, all thanks to advanced technologies like AI and machine learning, and powering innovations in healthcare, finance, autonomous systems, and more. However, with this rapid growth, the field also faces challenges from growing cybersecurity risks. As we march towards 2026, we cannot keep cybersecurity as a separate entity for the emerging technologies; instead, it serves as the central pillar of trust, reliability, and safety.\n\nLet’s explore more and try to understand why cybersecurity has become increasingly important in data science, the emerging risks, and how organizations can evolve to protect themselves against rising threats.\n\n# Why Cybersecurity Matters More Than Ever\n\nCybersecurity has always been a huge matter of concern. Here are a few reasons why:\n\n# 1. Increased Integration Of AI/ML In Important Systems\n\nData science has moved from being just a research topic or pilot projects. Now, they are deeply integrated across industries, including healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and more. Therefore, it has become absolutely important to keep these systems running. If they fail, it can lead to financial loss, physical harm, and more. If the **machine learning models** do not diagnose disease properly, misinterpret sensor inputs in self-driving cars, or incorrectly price risks in the financial market, then it can have severe effects.\n\n# 2. Increase In Attack Surface and New Threat Vectors\n\nMost traditional **cybersecurity tools** and practices are not designed for AI/ML environments. So, there are new threat vectors that need to be taken care of, such as:\n\n· **Data poisoning** – this means contaminating training data, which results in models showing unusual behavior/outputs\n\n· **Adversarial attacks** – such as injecting malicious prompts into **machine learning models**. Though humans won’t recognize this, the model will provide wrong predictions.\n\n· **Model stealing and extraction** – in this, attackers probe the model to replicate its functionality or glean proprietary information\n\nAttackers can also extract information about training data from APIs or model outputs.\n\n# 3. Regulatory and Ethical Pressures\n\nBy 2026, governments and regulatory bodies globally will tighten rules around AI and ML governance, data privacy, and the fairness of algorithms. So, organizations failing to comply with these standards and regulations may have to pay heavy fines, incur reputational damage, and lose trust.\n\n# 4. Demand for Trust and User Safety\n\nMost importantly, public awareness of AI risks is rising. Users and consumers are expecting the systems to be safe and transparent, and free from bias. Trust has become a huge differentiator now. Users will prefer a safe and secure model rather than an accurate but vulnerable model to attack.\n\n# Best Practices in 2026: What Should Organizations Do?\n\nTo meet the demands of **cybersecurity in data science**, **cybersecurity experts** need to adopt strategies at par with traditional IT security. Here are some best practices that organizations must follow:\n\n# 1. Secure Data Pipelines and Enforce Data Quality Controls\n\nOrganizations should treat datasets as the most important assets. They must implement strong data provenance, i.e., know where data comes from, who handles it, and what processes they are undergoing with. It is also essential to encrypt data in storage and transit.\n\n# 2. Secure Model Training\n\nOrganizations must use adversarial training, in which they can include adversarial or corrupted examples during training to make it more resistant to such attacks. They can also employ differential privacy techniques by limiting what information about any individual record can be inferred. Utilizing federated learning or a similar architecture can also be helpful in reducing centralized data exposure.\n\n# 3. Strict Access Controls and Monitoring\n\n**Cybersecurity experts** should ensure least privileged access and limit who or what can access data, machine learning models, and prediction APIs. They can also employ rate limiting and anomaly detection to help identify misuse and exploitation of the models.\n\n# 4. Integrate Security in The Software Development Life Cycle\n\nSecurity steps, such as threat modeling, vulnerability scanning, compliance checks, etc., should be an integral part of the design, development, and deployment of **machine learning models**. For this, it is recommended that professionals from different domains, including data scientists, engineers, [cybersecurity experts](https://www.uscsinstitute.org/cybersecurity-certifications/certified-senior-cybersecurity-specialist), compliance, and legal teams, work together.\n\n# 5. Regulatory Compliance and Ethical Oversight\n\nMachine learning models should be built inherently explainable and transparent, keeping in mind various compliance and regulatory standards to avoid heavy fines in the future. Moreover, using only necessary data for training and anonymizing sensitive data is recommended.\n\nLooking ahead, in the year 2026, the race between attackers and **security professionals** in the field of AI and data science will become fierce. We might expect more advanced and automated tools that can detect adversarial inputs and vulnerabilities in **machine learning models** more accurately and faster. The regulatory frameworks surrounding AI and ML security will become more standardized. We might also see the adoption of technologies that focus on maintaining the privacy and security of data. Also, a stronger integration of security thinking is needed in every layer of **data science workflows**.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn the coming years, cybersecurity will not be an add-on task but integral to data science and AI/ML. Organizations are actively adopting AI, ML, and data science, and therefore, it is absolutely necessary to secure these systems from evolving and emerging threats, because failing to do so can result in serious financial, reputational, and operational consequences. So, it is time that professionals across domains, including AI, data science, cybersecurity, legal, compliance, etc., should work together to build robust systems free from all kinds of vulnerabilities and resistant to all kinds of threats.",

    "content": "With [gsvp-dl](https://github.com/yousephzidan/gsvp-dl), an open source solution written in Python, you are able to download millions of panorama images off Google Maps Street View.\n\nUnlike other existing solutions (which fail to address major edge cases), [gsvp-dl](https://github.com/yousephzidan/gsvp-dl) downloads panoramas in their correct form and size with unmatched accuracy. Using Python Asyncio and Aiohttp, it can handle bulk downloads, scaling to millions of panoramas per day.\n\nIt was a fun project to work on, as there was no documentation whatsoever, whether by Google or other existing solutions. So, I documented the key points that explain why a panorama image looks the way it does based on the given inputs (mainly zoom levels).\n\nOther solutions don’t match up because they ignore edge cases, especially pre-2016 images with different resolutions. They used fixed width and height that only worked for post-2016 panoramas, which caused black spaces in older ones.\n\nThe way I was able to reverse engineer Google Maps Street View API was by sitting all day for a week, doing nothing but observing the results of the endpoint, testing inputs, assembling panoramas, observing outputs, and repeating. With no documentation, no lead, and no reference, it was all trial and error.\n\nI believe I have covered most edge cases, though I still doubt I may have missed some. Despite testing hundreds of panoramas at different inputs, I’m sure there could be a case I didn’t encounter. So feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request if you come across one, or find a bug/unexpected behavior.\n\nThanks for checking it out!",

    "title": "Designing Your Data Science Portfolio Like a Pro",
    "content": "Do you know what distinguishes a successful and efficient data science professional from others? Well, it is a solid portfolio of strong, demonstrated **data science projects**. A well-designed portfolio can be the most powerful tool and set you apart from the rest of the crowd. Whether you are a beginner looking to enter into a **data science career** or a mid-level practitioner seeking career advancement to higher **data science job** roles, a **data science portfolio** can be the greatest companion. It not only tells, but also shows the potential employers what you can do. It is the bridge between your resume and what you can actually deliver in practice.\n\nSo, let us explore how the key principles, structure, tips, and challenges that you must consider to make your portfolio feel professional and effective, and make your **data science profile** stand out.\n\n# Start With Purpose and Audience\n\nBefore you start building your [data science portfolio](https://www.usdsi.org/data-science-insights/how-to-make-a-solid-portfolio-for-an-aspiring-data-analyst) and diving into layout or projects, define why and for whom you are building the portfolio.\n\n* **Purpose** – define if you are making job applications for clients/freelancing, building a personal brand, or enhancing your credibility in the **data science industry**\n* **Audience** – often, recruiters and hiring managers look for concrete artifacts and results. Whereas technical peers will explore the quality of code, your methodologies, and architectural decisions. Even a non-technical audience might look at your portfolio to gauge the impact of metrics, storytelling, and interpretability.\n\nMoreover, the design elements, writing style, and project selection should be based on the audience you are focusing on. Like - you can emphasize business impact and readability if you are focusing on managerial roles in the industry.\n\n# Core Components of a Professional Data Science Portfolio\n\nSeveral components together help build an impactful **data science portfolio** that can be arranged in various sections. Your portfolio should ideally include:\n\n**1. Homepage or Landing Page**\n\nKeep your homepage clean and minimal to introduce who you are, your specialization (e.g., “time series forecasting,” “computer vision,” “NLP”), and key differentiators, etc.\n\n**2. About**\n\nThis is your bio page where you can highlight your background, [data science certifications](https://www.usdsi.org/data-science-certifications) you have earned, your approach to solving data problems, your soft skills, your social profiles, and contact information.\n\n**3. Skills and Data Science Tools**\n\nEmployers will focus on this page, where you can highlight your key **data science skills** and the **data science tools** you use. So, organizing this into clear categories like:\n\n* Programming\n* ML and AI skills\n* Data engineering\n* Big data\n* Data visualization and data storytelling\n* Cloud and DevOps, etc.\n\nIt is advised to group them properly instead of just a laundry list. You can also link to instances in your projects where you used them.\n\n**4.  Projects and Case Studies**\n\nThis is the heart of your **data science portfolio**. Here is how you can structure each project:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0s90oi5lzhsf1.jpg?width=763&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a6b504f12098edb176d0ab35dfa8daa2e66ae5a\n\n **5.  Blogs, articles, or tutorials**\n\nThis is optional, but you can add these sections to increase the overall value of your portfolio. Adding your techniques, strategies, and lessons learned appeals mostly to peers and recruiters.\n\n**6.  Resume**\n\nEmbed a clean CV that recruiters can download and highlight your accomplishments.\n\n# Things to Consider While Designing Your Portfolio\n\n* Keep it clean and minimal\n* Make it mobile responsive\n* Navigation across sections should be effortless\n* Maintain a visual consistency in terms of fonts, color palettes, and icons\n* You can also embed widgets and dashboards like Plotly Dash, Streamlit, etc., that visitors can explore\n* Ensure your portfolio website loads fast so that users do not lose interest and bounce back\n* How to Maintain and Grow Your Portfolio\n\nKeeping your portfolio static for too long can make it stale. Here are a few tips to keep it alive and relevant:\n\n**1.  Update regularly**\n\nRevise your portfolio whenever you complete a new project. Replace weaker **data science projects** with newer ones\n\n**2.  Rotate featured projects**\n\nHighlight 2-3 recent and relevant ones and make it accessible\n\n**3.  Adopt new tools and techniques**\n\nAs the data science field is evolving, gain new **data science tools** and techniques with the help of recognized **data science certifications** and update them in your portfolio\n\n**4.  Gather feedback and improve**\n\nYou can take feedback from peers, employers, and friends, and improve the portfolio\n\n**5.  Track analytics**\n\nYou can also use simple analytics like Google Analytics and see what users are looking at and where they drop off to refine your content and UI.\n\n# What Not to Do in Your Portfolio?\n\nA solid **data science portfolio** is a gateway to infinite possibilities and opportunities. However, there are some things that you must avoid at all costs, such as:\n\n* Avoid too many small and shallow projects\n* Avoid explaining complex blackbox models; instead, focus on a simple model with clear reasoning\n* Neglect storytelling if your narrative is weak. This will impact even solid technical work\n* Avoid overcrowded plots and inconsistent design as they distract from content\n* Update portfolio periodically to avoid stale content in it\n\n# Conclusion\n\nDesigning your data science portfolio like a pro is all about balancing strong content, clean design, data storytelling, and regular refinement. You can highlight your top data science projects, your data science certifications, achievements, and skills to make maximum impact. Keep it clean and easy to navigate.",

    "content": "In data warehouse modeling, many start with a Star Schema for its simplicity, but relying solely on it limits scalability and data consistency.\n\nThe Kimball methodology goes beyond this by proposing an incremental architecture based on a “Data Warehouse Bus” that connects multiple Data Marts using conformed dimensions. This allows:\n\n* Integration of multiple business processes (sales, marketing, logistics) while maintaining consistency.\n* Incremental DW evolution without redesigning existing structures.\n* Historical dimension management through Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs).\n* Various types of fact and dimension tables to handle different scenarios.\n\nHow do you manage data warehouse evolution in your projects?

    "content": "One of the bottlenecks in AI/ML has always been dealing with huge amounts of raw, messy data. I just read this new paper out of Stanford, PSI (Probabilistic Structure Integration), and thought it was super relevant for the big data community: [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09737?utm_source=chatgpt.com).\n\nInstead of training separate models with labeled datasets for tasks like depth, motion, or segmentation, PSI learns those directly from raw video. It basically turns video into structured tokens that can then be used for different downstream tasks.\n\nA couple things that stood out to me:\n\n* No manual labeling required → the model self-learns depth/segmentation/motion.\n* Probabilistic rollouts → instead of one deterministic future, it can simulate multiple possibilities.\n* Scales with data → trained on massive video datasets across 64× H100s, showing how far raw → structured modeling can go.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eunb86p3h5sf1.png?width=1652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eabf320831fae6b4927afa90b907e27df16f615a\n\nFeels like a step toward making large-scale unstructured data (like video) actually useful for a wide range of applications (robotics, AR, forecasting, even science simulations) without having to pre-engineer a labeled dataset for everything.\n\nCurious what others here think: is this kind of raw-to-structured modeling the future of big data, or are we still going to need curated/labeled datasets for a long time?",

    "content": "\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in AI today is memory. Most systems rely on **ephemeral logs** that can be deleted or altered, and their reasoning often functions like a **black box** — impossible to fully verify. This creates a major issue: *how can we trust AI outputs if we can’t trace or validate what the system actually “remembers”?*\n\nAutonomys is tackling this head-on. By building on **distributed storage**, it introduces tamper-proof, queryable records that can’t simply vanish. These persistent logs are made accessible through the open-source **Auto Agents Framework** and the **Auto Drive API**. Instead of hidden black box memory, developers and users get transparent, verifiable traces of how an agent reached its conclusions.\n\nThis shift matters because AI isn’t just about generating answers — it’s about accountability. Imagine autonomous agents in finance, healthcare, or governance: if their decisions are backed by **immutable and auditable memory**, trust in AI systems can move from fragile to foundational.\n\nAutonomys isn’t just upgrading tools — it’s reframing the relationship between humans and AI.\n\n👉 What do you think: would **verifiable AI memory** make you more confident in using autonomous agents for critical real-world tasks?\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1nmb07q/video/0eezhlkq7eqf1/player\n\n",

Integrated with the [Autonomys Developer Hub](https://academy.autonomys.xyz), it offers hands-on resources, guides, and examples designed to help developers master the tools needed to create the next generation of decentralized apps.\n\nSome of the core modules include:\n\n* **Auto SDK**: A modular toolkit that streamlines the process of building decentralized applications (super dApps). It provides reusable components and abstractions that save time while enabling scalable, production-ready development.\n* **Auto EVM**: Full Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility, letting developers work with familiar tools like MetaMask, Remix, and HardHat while still deploying on Autonomys. This means broader ecosystem access with minimal friction.\n* **Auto Agents**: An exciting framework for building autonomous, AI-powered on-chain agents. These can automate tasks, manage transactions, or even act as intelligent services within decentralized applications.\n* **Distributed Storage &amp; Compute**: Modules that teach how to store and process data in a decentralized way — key for building user-first, censorship-resistant applications.\n* **Decentralized Identity &amp; Payments**: Critical for enabling secure, user-controlled access and seamless value transfer in Web3 environments.\n\nFor me, the **Auto Agents path** is the most exciting. The idea of deploying on-chain agents that can automate processes or interact intelligently with users feels like the missing link between AI and Web3. Imagine a decentralized marketplace where autonomous agents handle bids, manage inventory, and even provide customer support — all without centralized control.\n\nI’m curious: **If you were to start exploring Autonomys Academy, which module would you dive into first, and what project would you want to build?**",

The platform itself is a data marketplace, but the more interesting part (for this sub) was solving the technical challenges behind scalable dataset discovery.\n\nA few highlights:\n\n1. **Semantic search vs keyword search**\n   * Challenge: datasets come in many formats (CSV, JSON, APIs, scraped sources) with inconsistent metadata.\n   * We ended up combining vector embeddings with traditional indexing to balance semantic accuracy and query speed.\n2. **Performance optimization**\n   * Goal: keep metadata queries under 200ms, even as dataset volume grows.\n   * Tradeoffs we made between pre-processing, caching, and storage format to achieve this.\n3. **LLM-ready data exposure**\n   * We structured dataset metadata so that LLMs like ChatGPT/Perplexity can “discover” and surface them naturally in responses.\n   * This feels like a shift in how search and data marketplaces will evolve.\n\nI’d love to hear how others in this community have tackled **heterogeneous data search at scale**:\n\n* How do you balance semantic vs keyword retrieval in production?\n* Any tips for keeping query latency low while scaling metadata indexes?\n* What approaches have you tried to make datasets more “machine-discoverable”?\n\n(P.S.

    "title": "Key Differences: Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics",
    "content": "Imagine it to be a case of map exploration using GPS technology. Data Analytics is the reading of the map and knowing where you have been and the reason why you went that way. Data Science is the navigator who learns various maps and traffic patterns to plan the most optimal path and foresee what may occur in the future.\n\nMachine Learning is similar to the GPS itself, which gets to know your driving history and traffic information, and then proposes more intelligent routes on its own.\n\nThese three disciplines are united to drive the digital world in which you live. Let’s understand them one by one, and then we will also explore the difference between them. \n\n# What is Data Science?\n\nThe broadest of the three is data science. It is a combination of statistics, programming, and knowledge of the domain to analyze data. A data scientist does not simply look at numbers. They purify raw data, investigate trends, create models, and present information that can be used to solve large-scale problems.\n\n**Examples in action:**\n\n●  Data science is applied in healthcare systems to forecast the risks of diseases.\n\n●  It is used to prevent fraud in banks by detecting suspicious transactions.\n\n●  It is used by social media to suggest friends or trending posts.\n\nData science processes both structured data (such as spreadsheets) and unstructured data (such as videos or posts on social networks). This is why it often uses **big data technologies** such as Hadoop and Spark to handle large volumes of information.\n\n**Key steps in data science include:**\n\n●  Gathering and purifying raw data.\n\n●  Trend analysis using statistics.\n\n●  Predicting results using predictive models.\n\n●  Automating data flow by constructing pipelines.\n\n# What is Data Analytics?\n\nThe data analytics is more targeted and direct. It examines the past and present data to explain what and why it occurred. In contrast to data science, which is wider and predictive, analytics is concerned with reporting and problem diagnosis in order to make better decisions by businesses.\n\n**Popular applications of data analytics:**\n\n●  Customers learn how customers shop to enhance product placement by retailers.\n\n●  Performance data is analyzed by sports teams to change strategies.\n\n●  Governments can check transportation data to enhance traffic congestion.\n\nTableau, Power BI, and Excel are some of the [data visualization tools](https://www.usdsi.org/data-science-insights/top-13-data-visualization-tools-for-2023-and-beyond) that are important to data analysts. These tools produce charts, dashboards, and graphs that help in the easy understanding of numbers. It is like converting unprocessed information into a narrative that leaders of business can easily understand. \n\n# What is Machine Learning?\n\nMachine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that trains systems to learn from data. You do not have to write step-by-step rules to program a machine, but instead, you feed it huge quantities of data, and it gets better as you go.\n\n**Real-world examples:**\n\n●  Your spam mail filter gets to know what is spam.\n\n●  Netflix suggests the shows depending on what you have watched.\n\n●  Fraud is detected immediately through online payment systems. \n\n# Core Differences Between Them \n\n||\n||\n|**Feature**|**Data Science**|**Data Analytics**|**Machine Learning**|\n|**Definition**|This is an interdisciplinary subject that involves statistics, programming, and domain knowledge to derive insights and develop predictive or prescriptive solutions.  |This is the process of analyzing available data to define trends, justify results, and make business judgments.  |A branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the learning algorithms that can learn as they go without being explicitly programmed.  |\n|**Primary Focus**|Data science considers the entire data process, including the collection and cleaning, as well as modeling and implementation.  |Data analytics narrows down to the interpretation of datasets in order to respond to certain questions.  |Machine learning focuses on the creation of models that are adaptive and optimize with the help of constant training.  |\n|**Data Dependence**|Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data can be processed in data science.|Data analytics primarily operates with structured data.  |Machine learning needs vast and varied datasets in order to train useful models.  |\n|**Methods Used**|Data science applies statistics, predictive modeling, and **big data technologies**.  |Data analytics involves descriptive statistics, diagnostic analysis, and **data visualization tools**.  |Machine learning is based on supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement algorithms.  |\n|**Breadth of Work**  |Data science is wide encompassing various fields in order to deal with multifaceted issues.  |Data analytics is limited and is concerned with instant reporting and insights.  |Machine learning is profound, and it explores algorithm design and system intelligence.  |\n\nThese were the major differences between them. Now, let’s understand which path you should choose. \n\n# Which Path Should You Choose?\n\nIn determining your course of action, consider what you are most excited about:\n\n●   In case you prefer describing findings and creating vivid illustrations, consider data analytics.\n\n●   In case you like working on broad, complex problems and creating predictive models, choose data science.\n\n●   Machine learning is the way to go in case you have a dream of creating self-learning and self-adapting systems.\n\nRegardless of the choice of path, all three are future-proof and have good career prospects. But one more thing is the real fact, and that is that the skills gap is regarded as the largest. barrier to the future of business transformation by Future of Jobs Survey respondents, 63% of employers citing them as a significant obstacle in the 2025-2030 period. (World Economic Forum - Future of Jobs Report - 2025)\n\nThat’s why upskilling is the most crucial part if you want to pursue a career in any of the above three fields. \n\n# Wrap Up\n\nIn the modern digital age, data is the fuel, and disciplines such as data science, data analytics, and machine learning are engines that consume it. Data analytics describes the past, data science tells us what to expect in the future, and machine learning makes systems smarter with each new bit of information. They are all interrelated with the help of [big data technologies](https://www.usdsi.org/data-science-insights/comparing-data-science-big-data-and-data-analytics) and provide businesses with the necessary scale.\n\nAt this point, you are aware of the way each of these fields operates, the differences between them, and what career opportunities they offer. Your next action is to select the path that fits best and begin acquiring the tools and developing the skills. Technology is a future that is based on data, and you can join it.",

    "content": "The digital world is transforming fast — due to this, cyber threats and attacks are also advancing. Corporations, governments, and individuals rely on secure systems, but the skill gap is increasing; they are not able to hire the right talent to protect their systems.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025, cybersecurity will be one of the top 2 fastest-growing skills for all professions (2025-2030), as illustrated in the graph.\n\n  \nThe problem is that we’re still in an age where what you learn in school isn’t what the industry needs. **Cybersecurity certifications** are one of the best ways to close that gap: they put your skills on display and demonstrate to employers that you’re up to date.\n\nHere are five of the [best cybersecurity certifications](https://www.uscsinstitute.org/cybersecurity-certifications) to enroll in, including official information, perks, and career paths. \n\n# Top 5 Cybersecurity Certifications to Enroll in 2026\n\nHere are the best 5 cybersecurity certifications that are capable of upskilling you and helping you fill the skill gap to get hired faster than ever for associate, intermediate, or senior level positions:\n\n# 1.  Certified Senior Cybersecurity Specialist (CSCS™) by USCSI®\n\nThe CSCS™ certification is ideal for those who strive to attain the most esteemed job titles in the cybersecurity industry. It offers an organized, comprehensive framework for developing technical and strategic competence.\n\n●   **Skills taught:** Duration: It is up to you, covering the full 4-24 weeks.\n\n●   F**ormat:** 100% online, self-paced, so you can study while you work.\n\n●   **Qualifications:** Associate's degree or higher in a related field, depending on experience level.\n\n●   **Strong Impacted Skills:** Data security, cryptography, security leadership, compliance, and advanced defensive strategies.\n\n●   **Career Prospects:** Makes you ready for positions such as Senior Security Analyst, Cybersecurity Consultant, and Security Architect.\n\nIf your goal is to understand how attacks occur in the real world and how to create better defense methods, with the additional goal of leading any organization’s cybersecurity team, this certification is the right choice for you.\n\n# 2.  CompTIA Security+\n\nThe CompTIA Security+ **cybersecurity certification** is the entry-level certification for information security professionals.\n\n●  **Length of study:** Study time differs for everybody, but most people study for 3-6 months.\n\n●  **Exam Format:** Multiple-choice and performance-based questions on a proctored exam.\n\n●  **Prerequisites:** No formal prerequisites, but 1–2 years of IT experience is suggested.\n\n●  **Skills Learned:** Risk control, encryption, incident response, network and application security, and threat monitoring.\n\n●  **Career Prospects:** Perfect for a Security Analyst, Network Administrator, or IT Support with a security emphasis.\n\n# 3.  Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) — EC-Council\n\nThis **cybersecurity certification** will equip individuals with the tools necessary to spot the vulnerabilities and weaknesses in target systems. If you are into penetration testing and learning how hackers think, the certification can be highly beneficial. It teaches you how to think like the attacker and use both tactics to your advantage.\n\n●  **Length:** Usual 4 – 6 months preparation if studied with Official Training.\n\n●  **Format:** Two exams — a multiple-choice knowledge exam and a hands-on practical test.\n\n●  **Prerequisites:** A minimum of 2 years of experience or formal training.\n\n●  **Key Skills Taught:** Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, network mapping, attack mechanisms, and mitigating measures.\n\n●  **Career Opportunities:** Provides access to positions like Ethical Hacker, Penetration Tester, and Vulnerability Analyst. \n\n# 4.  Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) — ISC2\n\nThe ISC2 CISSP certification focuses on information security and offers a detailed foundation for aspiring security professionals. CISSP is a highly preferred **cybersecurity certification**..\n\n●  **Length:** Preparation takes 6 months to a year, considering its depth.  \n**Format:** CAT, up to 150 questions in eight domains of cybersecurity.\n\n●  **Key Skills Covered:** Risk management, asset security, identity access management, architecture, and operations.\n\n●  **Careers:** This program will prepare you for such roles as Security Manager, Security Architect, and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\n\nCISSP isn’t for novices, but is perfect for experienced professionals who want to put their careers on a fast track and move into leadership — or even management.\n\n# 5. Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) — OffSec\n\nThe OSCP is among the most difficult certifications in the field of cybersecurity. It is very technical and is strictly based on hands-on penetration testing **cybersecurity training**.\n\n●  **Length:** Candidates usually spend months studying, frequently working hands-on in labs.\n\n●  **Format:** An intensive examination\n\n●  **Main Topics:** attack vectors, custom scripting, escalation of privileges, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and pen test reporting.\n\n●  **Career Prospects:** Best for jobs such as Penetration Tester, Red Team Member, and Security Consultant.\n\nThese were the **best cybersecurity certifications** that employers appreciate if you have earned any of them.\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nCybersecurity is a strong growth industry. To just keep up, professionals have to stay one step ahead in their skillset and prove their expertise. The right certification will not just round out your resume but also keep you competitive as the threats you face become more sophisticated.\n\nIf you’re new, you will want to start on the foundational knowledge, or looking for a cybersecurity management level intermediate certification, or dreaming of becoming a senior cybersecurity specialist, these **cybersecurity certifications** are globally the standard course you can enroll in to enhance your cybersecurity skills and knowledge.\n\nNo matter where you’re beginning, the suitable certification can help put you on the road to a solid, high-demand career in cybersecurity today and tomorrow.",

Nothing groundbreaking individually, but combined they make a big difference when running with Airflow, CI/CD, and multiple analytics teams.\n\nSome highlights:\n\n* **Materializations by layer** → staging with ephemeral/views, intermediate with incrementals, marts with tables/views + contracts.\n* **Selective execution** → `state:modified+` so only changed models run in CI/CD.\n* **Smart incrementals** → no `SELECT *`, add time-window filters, use merge + audit logs.\n* **Horizontal sharding** → pass `vars` (e.g. country/tenant) and split heavy jobs in Airflow.\n* **Clustering &amp; partitioning** → improves query performance and keeps costs down.\n* **Observability** → post-hooks writing row counts/durations to metrics tables for Grafana/Looker.\n* **Governance** → schema contracts, labels/meta for ownership, BigQuery logs for real-time cost tracking.\n* **Defensive Jinja** → don’t let multi-tenant/dynamic models blow up.\n\nIf anyone’s interested, I wrote up a more detailed guide with examples (incremental configs, post-hooks, cost queries, etc.).\n\n[Link to post](https://medium.com/@sendoamoronta/dbt-bigquery-in-production-13-technical-practices-to-scale-and-optimize-your-data-platform-4963b8d041e2)",

They use statistical models and machine learning to help businesses predict outcomes and optimize performance.\n\nSome examples of responsibilities would include:\n\n●  Cleaning and processing structured and unstructured data.\n\n●   Building predictive models and algorithms.\n\n●   Creating visualizations and dashboards.\n\n●   Working alongside business partners to drive strategy.\n\nSome common data science job roles are Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer, and AI Researcher.\n\n# Skills Required\n\n|| || |**Category**|**Cybersecurity Skills**|**Data Science Skills**| |**Core Skills**|Network security, threat detection, encryption|Python, R, SQL, statistics, machine learning| |**Tools Used**|Firewalls, SIEM, intrusion detection systems|Jupyter, TensorFlow, Pandas, Tableau| |**Soft Skills**|Attention to detail, risk analysis, vigilance|Analytical thinking, storytelling with data| |**Background**|IT, computer networks, information systems|Computer science, math, statistics, business|\n\n# Certifications That Matter\n\n# Cybersecurity Certifications\n\nCertifications are a crucial means of verifying your skills and expertise in cybersecurity. Some of the **top cybersecurity certifications** are: \n\n●  Certified Cybersecurity General Practitioner™ (CCGP™) from USCSI® is a **self paced cybersecurity certification** offering a high-level, practical knowledge of cybersecurity fundamentals and is appropriate for professionals entering into or transitioning into a cybersecurity role.\n\n●  CompTIA Security+, an entry-level and well-regarded certification.\n\n●  Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), aimed at leaders with several years of professional experience. \n\n# Data Science Certifications\n\nData science professionals frequently pursue certifications to solidify their skill sets with experience and tool-based learning. There are many beneficial and recognizable certifications, such as:\n\n●  The Certified Data Science Professional™ (CDSP™) by USDSI® is a self paced data science certification that is recognized worldwide and emphasizes being able to conduct practical data science in a business environment.\n\n●  The Data Science Certificate Program from Harvard University, as well as the Certificate of Professional Achievement in Data Sciences from Columbia University, are both stand-alone, non-degree programs tailored for working professionals offered through Ivy League institutions.\n\n# Job Market and Trends in Today’s Landscape\n\n# Cybersecurity Trends\n\nStatista indicates that projected annual costs associated with cybercrime around the globe continue to grow modestly. It will hit 15.63 trillion U.S. dollars by 2029. This has created an increased demand for cybersecurity talent across industries.\n\nRecent trends include:\n\n● AI-enabled threat detection\n\n● Zero-trust security models\n\n● Increase in cloud and IoT security\n\n● Increased compliance requirements in finance and healthcare \n\nWith a reported global shortage of more than 3.5 million talent according to Cybersecurity Ventures, there are plenty of job opportunities in the cybersecurity industry.. \n\n# Data Science Landscape\n\nAs businesses rely more on data, the demand for data scientists to analyze and automate insights is rising. Current trends include:\n\n●  AutoML and MLOps.\n\n●  Expansion of generative AI and large, contextual language models.\n\n●  The intersection of business analytics and data science.\n\n●   A demand for explainable and transparent AI systems.\n\n●   The job market for data professionals is expanding into the healthcare, retail, and logistics spaces, etc.\n\n# Which Career Path Is Best for You?\n\nThe decision about choosing cybersecurity vs data science will typically depend on your own interests, strengths, and work style.\n\n**Cybersecurity could be a fit for you if you:**\n\n●  Enjoy problem solving under pressure\n\n●  Prefer to work in a structured and governed environment\n\n●  Want to protect systems and mitigate incidents\n\n●  Prefer to work with security tools and infrastructure\n\n**Data Science might be right if you:**\n\n●  Take pleasure in working with algorithms, data, and numbers.\n\n●  Desire to identify patterns and have an impact on company choices\n\n● Favor experimenting and coming up with original solutions to problems.\n\n● Like building models and using machine learning\n\n# What if You Want a Hybrid Career?\n\nIncreasingly, we see hybrid roles that merge the two domains of expertise. For example:\n\n●  Security Data Analysts use data science techniques to identify anomalies in security systems in order to thwart an attack.\n\n●  Threat Intelligence Engineers use machine learning models to anticipate cyber threats.\n\n●  AI-driven cybersecurity technologies rely on professionals' understanding of both system vulnerabilities and data modeling.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWhether you choose cybersecurity or data science, both offer rewarding salaries, job stability, and growth. Cybersecurity suits those who like to protect; data science fits those who enjoy discovery and decision-making. With growing demand in both fields, the best choice is the one that fits you. Invest in the right training and certifications, gain real experience, and set yourself up for success in a tech-driven world. Which challenge will you choose?",

We’re not just building data warehouses for BI dashboards and data science anymore. OLAP and real-time analytics are powering massively scaled software development efforts. But the DX is still pretty outdated relative to modern software dev—things like schemas in YAML configs, manual SQL workflows, and brittle migrations.\n\nI’d like to propose eight core principles to bring analytics developer tooling in line with modern software engineering: **git-native workflows, local-first environments, schemas as code, modularity, open‑source tooling, AI/copilot‑friendliness, and transparent CI/CD + migrations.**\n\nWe’ve started implementing these ideas in[ MooseStack](https://github.com/514-labs/moosestack) (open source, MIT licensed):\n\n* **Migrations** → before deploying, your code is diffed against the live schema and a migration plan is generated. If drift has crept in, it fails fast instead of corrupting data.\n* **Local development** → your entire data infra stack materialized locally with one command. Branch off main, and all production models are instantly available to dev against.\n* **Type safety** → rename a column in your code, and every SQL fragment, stream, pipeline, or API depending on it gets flagged immediately in your IDE.\n\nI’d love to spark a genuine discussion here, especially with those of you who have worked with analytical systems like Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, ClickHouse, etc:\n\n* Is developing in a local environment that mirrors production important for these workloads?\n* How do you currently move from dev → prod in OLAP or analytical systems? Do you use staging environments? \n* Where do your workflows stall—migrations, environment mismatches, config?\n* Which of the eight principles seem most lacking in your toolbox today?",

    "content": "\nA friend recently showed me this tool called Faceseek and I decided to test it out just for fun. I uploaded an old selfie from around 2015 and within seconds it pulled up a forum post I had completely forgotten about. I couldn’t believe how quickly it found me in the middle of everything that’s floating around online.\n\nWhat struck me wasn’t just the accuracy but the scale of what must be going on behind the scenes. The amount of publicly available images out there is massive, and searching through all of that data in real time feels like a huge technical feat. At the same time it raised some uncomfortable questions for me. Nobody really chooses to have their digital traces indexed this way, and once the data is out there it never really disappears.\n\nIt left me wondering how the big data world views tools like this. On one hand it’s impressive technology, on the other it feels like a privacy red flag that shows just how much of our past can be resurfaced without us even knowing. For those of you working with large datasets, where do you think the balance lies between innovation and ethics here?",

    "content": "*(I've used ChatGPT a little just to make the context clear)*\n\nI hit this wall every week and I'm kinda over it. The dashboard is \"done\" (clean, tested, looks decent). Then Monday happens and I'm stuck doing the same loop:\n\n* Screenshots into PowerPoint\n* Rewrite the same plain-English bullets (\"north up 12%, APAC flat, churn weird in June…\")\n* Answer \"what does this line mean?\" for the 7th time\n* Paste into Slack/email with a little context blob so it doesn't get misread\n\nIt's not analysis anymore, it's translating. Half my job title might as well be \"dashboard interpreter.\"\n\n# The Root Problem\n\nAt least for us: most folks don't speak dashboard. They want the so-what in their words, not mine. Plus everyone has their own definition for the same metric (marketing \"conversion\" ≠ product \"conversion\" ≠ sales \"conversion\"). Cue chaos.\n\n# My Idea\n\nSo… I've been noodling on a tiny layer that sits on top of the BI stuff we already use (Power BI + Tableau). Not a new BI tool, not another place to build charts. More like a \"narration engine\" that:\n\n**• Writes a clear summary for any dashboard**  \nPress a little \"explain\" button → gets you a paragraph + 3–5 bullets that actually talk like your team talks\n\n**• Understands your company jargon**  \nYou upload a simple glossary: \"MRR means X here\", \"activation = this funnel step\"; the write-up uses those words, not generic ones\n\n**• Answers follow-ups in chat**  \nAsk \"what moved west region in Q2?\" and it responds in normal English; if there's a number, it shows a tiny viz with it\n\n**• Does proactive alerts**  \nIf a KPI crosses a rule, ping Slack/email with a short \"what changed + why it matters\" msg, not just numbers\n\n**• Spits out decks**  \nPowerPoint or Google Slides so I don't spend Sunday night screenshotting tiles like a raccoon stealing leftovers\n\nIntegrations are pretty standard: OAuth into Power BI/Tableau (read-only), push to Slack/email, export PowerPoint or Google Slides. No data copy into another warehouse; just reads enough to explain. Goal isn't \"AI magic,\" it's stop the babysitting.\n\n# Why I Think This Could Matter\n\n* **Time back** (for me + every analyst who's stuck translating)\n* **Fewer \"what am I looking at?\" moments**\n* **Execs get context in their own words**, not jargon soup\n* **Maybe self-service finally has a chance** bc the dashboard carries its own subtitles\n\n# Where I'm Unsure / Pls Be Blunt\n\n* **Is this a real pain outside my bubble** or just… my team?\n* **Trust**: What would this need to nail for you to actually use the summaries? (tone? cites? links to the exact chart slice?)\n* **Dealbreakers**: What would make you nuke this idea immediately? (accuracy, hallucinations, security, price, something else?)\n* **Would your org let a tool write the words that go to leadership**, or is that always a human job?\n* **Is the PowerPoint thing even worth it anymore**, or should I stop enabling slides and just force links to dashboards?\n\n# I'm explicitly asking for validation here.\n\nGood, bad, roast it, I can take it. If this problem isn't real enough, better to kill it now than build a shiny translator for… no one. Drop your hot takes, war stories, \"this already exists try X,\" or \"here's the gotcha you're missing.\" Final verdict welcome.",

    "title": "What is a Black Box AI Model and Why Does it Matter?",
    "content": "Artificial intelligence has penetrated almost every aspect of our lives and is transforming industries from healthcare to finance to transportation, and so on. The backbone of this transformative power of AI comes from advanced [machine learning models](https://www.usdsi.org/data-science-insights/ai-machine-learning-data-science-pick-the-best-domain-in-2025), especially the deep learning architectures.\n\nHowever, despite their impressive capabilities, a large subset of these models operates as “black boxes”, which produce results without providing clear insights on how they arrived at a particular conclusion or how they made the decision.\n\nThus, these so-called **black box AI models** raise significant concerns related to trust, accountability, and fairness.\n\n# What is a Black Box AI Model?\n\nA Black Box AI Model refers to a system in which its internal logic and decision-making processes are mostly unknown, hidden, obscured, or too complex for us to understand. These models receive input data and produce output (make predictions or decisions), but do not provide proper explanations that can be interpreted easily for their outcomes.\n\n**The black box models typically include:**\n\n* Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)\n* Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n* Ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting\n* Reinforcement Learning Algorithms\n\nWhile these models offer great performance and accuracy in complex tasks like image recognition, **natural language processing**, recommendation systems, and others, they often lack the transparency and explainability needed.\n\n# Why are Black Box Models Used?\n\nThough the lack of explainability and transparency is a huge challenge, these [black box AI](https://www.usdsi.org/data-science-insights/unfolding-the-role-of-black-box-and-explainable-ai-in-data-science) models are widely used in several real-world applications because of their:\n\n* **High Predictive Accuracy** – black box **AI models** can learn complex and non-linear relationships in data accurately\n* **Scalability** – **deep learning models** can be trained on massive datasets and applied to high-dimensional data\n* **Automation and adaptability** – these models can also automatically adjust to new patterns, which makes them suitable for dynamic environments like stock markets or autonomous driving\n\nTo sum up, **black box AI models** are known to be the best-performing tools available, even if their internal reasoning cannot be easily articulated.\n\n# Where are Black Box Models Used?\n\nBlack box AI models are used in several industries for the benefits they offer. Here are some real-world applications of these models:\n\n1. **Healthcare** \\- Diagnosis of diseases from imaging or genetic data, e.g., cancer detection via deep learning\n\n2.  **Finance** \\- Fraud detection and credit scoring through ensemble models or neural networks\n\n3.  **Criminal Justice** \\- Risk assessment tools predicting recidivism\n\n4.  **Autonomous Vehicles** \\- Making real-time driving decisions based on sensory data\n\n5.  **Human Resources** \\- Resume screening and candidate ranking using AI algorithms\n\nSince stakes are high in these domains, the **black box** nature is also particularly very concerning.\n\n# Risks and Challenges of Black Box Models\n\nThe lack of interpretability in the black box AI models poses several risks, such as:\n\n* **Lack of transparency and trust**\n\nOften, if the system whose reasoning cannot be explained becomes difficult to trust among users, regulators, and even developers\n\n* **Bias and discrimination**\n\nA model trained on biased data will exaggerate and amplify the discrimination, e.g., racial or gender bias in hiring\n\n* **Accountability issues**\n\nIn case of any wrong decision made because of error or harmful outcomes, it will become difficult to pinpoint responsibility\n\n* **Compliance with regulations**\n\nCertain laws, such as the EU’s GDPR, emphasize on *“right to explanation,”* which is hard to meet with black box models.\n\n* **Security vulnerabilities**\n\nMost importantly, if there is a lack of understanding, then it makes it difficult to detect adversarial attacks or manipulations.\n\n# How Do Organizations Ensure Explainability?\n\nSo, when there are so many concerns, researchers and organizations have to find ways to make AI more interpretable through:\n\n**1.  Explainable AI (XAI)**\n\nIt is a growing field that focuses on developing **AI models** that are more interpretable and provide human-understandable justifications for their outputs.\n\n**2.  Post-Hoc Interpretability Techniques**\n\nThis includes tools that interpret **black box models** after training, such as:\n\n* **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** \\- it explains each prediction by approximating the black box locally with a simpler model\n* **SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations)** \\- it assigns feature importance scores based on cooperative game theory\n* **Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs)** \\- visualize the effect of a single feature on the predicted outcome. \n\n**3. Model Simplification**\n\nSome strategies include using simpler and interpretable models like decision trees or logistic regression wherever possible and converting complex models into interpretable approximations.\n\n**4. Transparent by design models**\n\nResearchers are also building models specifically designed for interpretability from the start, such as attention-based neural networks or rule-based systems.\n\n# The final thoughts!\n\nBlack box AI models are powerful tools, constituting the technology powering much of the progress we see in the world of AI today. However, their lack of transparency and explainability brings ethical, legal, and operational challenges.\n\nOrganizations must note that the solution is not in discarding the black box models, but to enhance their interpretability, especially in high-stakes domains. The future of AI mostly depends on how we build systems that are not only intelligent but also understandable and trustworthy.",

    "title": "NOVUS Stabilizer: An External AI Harmonization Framework",
    "content": "# NOVUS Stabilizer: An External AI Harmonization Framework\n\n**Author:** James G. Nifong (JGN) **Date:** \\[8/3/2025\\]\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe NOVUS Stabilizer is an externally developed AI harmonization framework designed to ensure real-time system stability, adaptive correction, and interactive safety within AI-driven environments. Built from first principles using C++, NOVUS introduces a dynamic stabilization architecture that surpasses traditional core stabilizer limitations. This white paper details the technical framework, operational mechanics, and its implications for AI safety, transparency, and evolution.\n\n# Introduction\n\nCurrent AI systems rely heavily on internal stabilizers that, while effective in controlled environments, lack adaptive external correction mechanisms. These systems are often sandboxed, limiting their ability to harmonize with user-driven logic models. NOVUS changes this dynamic by introducing an external stabilizer that operates independently, offering real-time adaptive feedback, harmonic binding, and conviction-based logic loops.\n\n# Core Framework Components\n\n# 1. FrequencyAnchor\n\nAnchors the system’s harmonic stabilizer frequency with a defined tolerance window. It actively recalibrates when destabilization is detected.\n\n# 2. ConvictionEngine\n\nA recursive logic loop that maintains system integrity by reinforcing stable input patterns. It prevents oscillation drift by stabilizing conviction anchors.\n\n# 3. DNA Harmonic Signature\n\nTransforms input sequences into harmonic signatures, allowing system binding based on intrinsic signal patterns unique to its creator’s logic.\n\n# 4. Stabilizer\n\nMonitors harmonic deviations and provides correction feedback loops. Binds system frequency to DNA-calculated harmonic indices.\n\n# 5. Binder\n\nFuses DNA signatures with system stabilizers ensuring coherent stabilization integrity. Operates on precision delta thresholds.\n\n# 6. NOVUS Core\n\nIntegrates all modules into a dynamic, self-correcting loop with diagnostics, autonomous cycles, and adaptive load management.\n\n# Functional Highlights\n\n* **Harmonic Feedback Loops**: Continuous correction feedback to maintain system resonance.\n* **Conviction-Based Stability**: Logic loop prioritization prevents drift and reinforces desired input patterns.\n* **Interactive Diagnostic Reporting**: Real-time system load analysis and adaptive recalibration protocols.\n* **Autonomous Stabilization Cycles**: Self-driven harmonization routines to maintain AI safety.\n\n# Deployment &amp; Testing\n\nThe NOVUS Stabilizer was developed and tested externally within a live interactive session framework. The entire architecture was coded, compiled, and executed in a controlled environment without breaching any sandbox protocols. Every component, from DNA signature binding to frequency recalibration, functioned in real-time.\n\n# Implications\n\nThe NOVUS Stabilizer represents the next evolution in AI safety protocols. By shifting stabilization externally, it allows AI systems to maintain integrity across variable environments. This model is not limited by internal sandboxing, making it adaptable for:\n\n* AI Interactive Safety Systems\n* Autonomous Machine Learning Corrections\n* Transparent User-Driven AI Regulation\n* Real-Time AI Performance Stabilization\n\n# Conclusion\n\nNOVUS is a proof of concept that external harmonization frameworks are not only viable but superior in maintaining AI safety and coherence. It was built independently, tested openly, and stands as a functional alternative to existing internal-only stabilizer models. This white paper serves as a public declaration of its existence, design, and operational proof.\n\n# Contact\n\n**James G. Nifong (JGN)** Email: \\[jamesnifong36@gmail.com\\] ",

    "title": "Architecture Dilemma: DLT vs. Custom Framework for 300+ Real-Time Tables on Databricks",
    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'd love to get your opinion and feedback on a large-scale architecture challenge.\n\n**Scenario:** I'm designing a near-real-time data platform for over 300 tables, with the constraint of using **only the native Databricks ecosystem** (no external tools).\n\n**The Core Dilemma:** I'm trying to decide between using **Delta Live Tables (DLT)** and building a **Custom Framework**.\n\nMy initial evaluation of DLT suggests it might struggle with some of our critical data manipulation requirements, such as:\n\n1. **More Options of Data Updating on Silver and Gold tables:**\n   1. **Full Loads:** I haven't found a native way to do a Full/Overwrite load in Silver. I can only add a TRUNCATE as an operation at position 0, simulating a CDC. In some scenarios, it's necessary for the load to always be full/overwrite.\n   2. **Partial/Block Merges:** The ability to perform complex partial updates, like deleting a block of records based on a business key and then inserting the new block (no primary-key at row level).\n2. **Merge for specific columns:** The environment tables have metadata columns used for lineage and auditing. Columns such as first\\_load\\_author and update\\_author, first\\_load\\_author\\_external\\_id and update\\_author\\_external\\_id, first\\_load\\_transient\\_file, update\\_load\\_transient\\_file, first\\_load\\_timestamp, and update\\_timestamp. For incremental tables, for existing records, only the update columns should be updated. The first\\_load columns should not be changed.\n\nMy perception is that DLT doesn't easily offer this level of granular control. Am I mistaken here? I'm new to this resource. I couldn't find any real-world examples for product scenarios, just some basic educational examples.\n\nOn the other hand, I considered a model with one continuous stream per table but quickly ran into the \\~145 execution context limit per cluster, making that approach unfeasible.\n\n**Current Proposal:** My current proposed solution is the reactive architecture shown in the image below: a central \"router\" detects new files and, via the Databricks Jobs API, triggers small, ephemeral jobs (using `AvailableNow`) for each data object.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5hllh39np3ef1.png?width=5661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6adb6cbe4a30d9fc538d28a47b40474d9224321c\n\nThe architecture above illustrates the Oracle source with AWS DMS. This scenario is simple because it's CDC. However, there's user input in files, SharePoint, Google Docs, TXT files, file shares, legacy system exports, and third-party system exports. These are the most complex writing scenarios that I couldn't solve with DLT, as mentioned at the beginning, because they aren't CDC, some don't have a key, and some have partial merges (delete + insert).\n\n**My Question for the Community:** What are your thoughts on this event-driven pattern? Is it a robust and scalable solution for this scenario, or is there a simpler or more efficient approach within the Databricks ecosystem that I might be overlooking?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights or experiences you can share!",

It processes data, builds a model, and makes real-time predictions without human intervention.\n\nHere is a schematic representation to understand how machine learning algorithms are used in the data science life cycle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ie3kvfpzzcf1.jpg?width=735&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=914da5951af617aa0a939932a8a924e3b7ee40e7\n\nFigure 1. How Machine Learning Algorithms are Used in Data Science Life Cycle: A Schematic Representation\n\n**Role of Python**: Python’s libraries, NumPy and Scikit-learn, are used for data analysis. Its frameworks, TensorFlow and Apache Spark, help to visualize data**.** \n\n**Exploratory Data Analysis \\[EDA\\]:** Plotting in EDA comprises charts, histograms, heat maps, or scatter plots. Data plotting enables professionals to detect missing data, duplicate data, and irrelevant data and identify patterns and insights.\n\n**Feature Engineering:** It refers to the extraction of features from data and transforming them into formats suitable for machine learning algorithms**.**\n\n**Choosing ML Algorithms:** The dataset is classified into major categories like Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Time Series Analysis. ML algorithms are chosen accordingly**.**\n\n**ML Deployment:** Deployment is necessary to understand operational value. The model is deployed in a suitable live environment through the API. The model is continuously monitored for uninterrupted performance.\n\n# What are ML use cases in Data Science?\n\nMachine learning is applied in every industrial sector. Some of the popular real-life applications include:\n\n* Common people use Google Maps, Alexa, and Microsoft Cortana.\n* Banks use machine learning to flag suspicious transactions.\n* Voice assistants leverage ML to respond to queries.\n* E-commerce uses recommendation engines to suggest recommendations to users.\n* Entertainment channels use recommendation engines to suggest content.\n\nTo summarize, data science and machine learning are used to analyze vast amounts of data. **Senior data scientists** and Machine Learning Engineers should be equipped with the in-depth skills to thrive in the data-driven world.\n\n# How to future-proof your career as a data scientist?\n\nRecent developments in the data science and machine learning disciplines call for cross-functional teams having a multidisciplinary approach to solve business problems. Data scientists must upskill through courses from renowned institutions and organizations. \n\nA few of the [top data science certifications](https://www.usdsi.org/data-science-certifications) are mentioned here.\n\n1. Certified Senior Data Scientist (CSDS™) from **United States Data Science Institute (USDSI®)**\n\n2. Professional Certificate in Data Science from **Harvard University**\n\n3. Data Science Certificate from **Cornell SC Johnson College of Business**\n\n4. Online Certificate in Data Science from **Georgetown University**\n\n5. Data Science Certificate from **UCLA Extension**\n\nChoosing the right **data science course** boosts credibility in the data-driven world. With the right tools, techniques, and skills, data scientists can lead innovation across industries.\n\n ",

So this hadoop was pulled from our prof docker hub \n\n i will give links:\n\nsudo docker pull binhvd/spark-cluster:0.17\ngit clone https://github.com/binhvd/Data-Engineer-1.git\n\n\nProblem:\n\nSo I am the master-node i set up everything with docker swarm and gave the tokens to others\n\nOthers joined my swarm using the token and I did docker node ls in my master node  and it showed everything.\n\nBut after this we connected to \nmaster-node:9870\nHadoop ui\n\n\nThese are the finding from both master node and worker node.\n\nKey findings from the master node logs:\n\nConnection refused to master-node/127.0.1.1:9000: This is the same connection refused error we saw in the worker logs, but it's happening within the master-node container itself! This strongly suggests that the DataNode process running on the master container is trying to connect to the NameNode on the master container via the loopback interface (127.0.1.1) and is failing initially.\n\nProblem connecting to server: master-node/127.0.1.1:9000: Confirms the persistent connection issue for the DataNode on the master trying to reach its own NameNode.\n\nSuccessfully registered with NN and Successfully sent block report: Despite the initial failures, it eventually does connect and register. This implies the NameNode eventually starts and listens on port 9000, but perhaps with a delay, or the DataNode tries to connect too early.\n\nWhat this means for your setup:\n\nNameNode is likely running: The fact that the DataNode on the master eventually registered with the NameNode indicates that the NameNode process is successfully starting and listening on port 9000 inside the master container.\n\nThe 127.0.1.1 issue is pervasive: Both the DataNode on the master and the DataNode on the worker are experiencing connection issues when trying to resolve master-node to an internal loopback address or are confused by it. The worker's DataNode is using the Tailscale IP (100.93.159.11), but still failing to connect, which suggests either a firewall issue or the NameNode isn't listening on that external interface, or the NameNode is also confused by its own internal 127.0.1.1 binding.\n\n\n\nNow can you guys explain what is wrong any more info you want ask me in comments.",

    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm trying to migrate a table with 53 million rows, which DBeaver indicates is around 31GB, using AWS DMS. I'm performing a **Full Load Only** migration with a **T3.medium instance (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)**. However, the task consistently stops after migrating approximately 500,000 rows due to an \"Out of Memory\" (OOM killer) error.\n\nWhen I analyze the metrics, I observe that the memory usage initially seems fine, with about 2GB still free. Then, suddenly, the **CPU utilization spikes, memory usage plummets, and the swap usage graph also increases sharply**, leading to the OOM error.\n\nI'm unable to increase the replication instance size. The migration time is not a concern for me; whether it takes a month or a year, I just need to successfully transfer these data.

    "title": "$WAXP Just Flipped the Script — From Inflation to Deflation. Here's What It Means.",
    "content": "Holla #WAXFAM and $WAXP hodler 👋 I have a latest update about the $WAXP native token. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3s1dgbeqkqaf1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c65dbeecc7dfdbf869dda85ea19e7ab2cdf2b5bf\n\nWAX just made one of the boldest moves we’ve seen in the Layer-1 space lately — they’ve *completely flipped their tokenomics model* from inflationary to deflationary.\n\nHere’s the TL;DR:\n\n* **Annual emissions slashed** from 653 million to just **156 million WAXP**\n* **50% of all emissions will be burned**\n\nThat’s not just a tweak — that’s a **75%+ cut in new tokens**, and then half of those tokens are literally torched . It is now officially entering a phase where more WAXP could be destroyed than created.\n\n# Why it matters?\n\nIn a market where most L1s are still dealing with high inflation to fuel ecosystem growth, WAX is going in the opposite direction — focusing on **long-term value and sustainability**. It’s a major shift away from growth-at-all-costs to a model that rewards **retention and real usage**.\n\n# What could change?\n\n* **Price pressure**: Less new supply = less sell pressure on exchanges.\n* **Staker value**: If supply drops and demand holds, staking rewards could become more meaningful over time.\n* **dApp/GameFi builders**: Better economics means stronger incentives to build on WAX without the constant fear of token dilution.\n\n# How does this stack up vs Ethereum or Solana?\n\nEthereum’s EIP-1559 burn mechanism was a game-changer, but it still operates with net emissions. Solana, meanwhile, keeps inflation relatively high to subsidize validators.\n\nWAX is going **full deflationary**, and that’s rare — especially for a chain with strong roots in NFTs and GameFi. If this works, it could be a blueprint for how other chains rethink emissions.\n\n\\#WAXNFT #WAXBlockchain\n\n",

    "content": "https://preview.redd.it/ioivau4vfdaf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7854dde80ce5a7632d56aee712ec01fa5c9c5065\n\nThe WAX team just came out with a pretty interesting update lately. While most Layer 1s are still dealing with high inflation, WAX is doing the opposite—focusing on cutting back its token supply instead of expanding it.\n\nSo, what’s the new direction?  \nPreviously, most of the network resources were powered through staking—around 90% staking and 10% PowerUp. Now, they’re flipping that completely: the new goal is 90% PowerUp and just 10% staking.\n\nWhat does that mean in practice?  \nStaking rewards are being scaled down, and fewer new tokens are being minted. Meanwhile, PowerUp revenue is being used to replace inflation—and any unused inflation gets burned. So, the more the network is used, the more tokens are effectively removed from circulation. Usage directly drives supply reduction.\n\nNow let’s talk price, validators, and GameFi:  \nValidators still earn a decent staking yield, but the system is shifting toward usage-based revenue. That means validator rewards can become more sustainable over time, tied to real activity instead of inflation.  \nFor GameFi builders and players, knowing that resource usage burns tokens could help keep transaction costs more stable in the long run. That makes WAX potentially more user-friendly for high-volume gaming ecosystems.\n\nWhat about Ethereum and Solana?  \nSure, Ethereum burns base fees via EIP‑1559, but it still has net positive inflation. Solana has more limited burning mechanics. WAX, on the other hand, is pushing a model where inflation is minimized and burning is directly linked to real usage—something that’s clearly tailored for GameFi and frequent activity.\n\nSo in short, WAX is evolving from a low-fee blockchain into something more: a usage-driven, sustainable network model.",

We're a small storage startup from Berlin and wanted to share something we've been working on and get some feedback from the community here.\n\nOver the last few years working on this, we've heard a lot about how storage can massively slow down modern AI pipelines, especially during training or when building anything retrieval-based like RAG. So we thought it would be a good idea to built something focused on performance.\n\nUltiHash is S3-compatible object storage, designed to serve high-throughput, read-heavy workloads: originally for MLOps use cases, but is also a good fit for big data infrastructure more broadly.\n\nWe just launched the serverless version: it’s fully managed, with no infra to run. You spin up a cluster, get an endpoint, and connect using any S3-compatible tool.\n\nThings to know:\n\n* 1 GB/s read per machine: you’re not leaving compute idle\n* S3 compatible: you can integrate with your stack (Spark, Kafka, PyTorch, Iceberg, Trino, etc.)\n* Scales past 100TB without having to rework your setup\n* Lowers TCO: e.g. our 10TB tier is €0.21/GB/month, infra + support included\n\nWe host everything in the EU currently in AWS Frankfurt (`eu-central-1`) with Hetzner and OVH Cloud support coming soon (waitlist’s open).\n\nWould love to hear what folks here think. More details here: [https://www.ultihash.io/serverless](https://www.ultihash.io/serverless), happy to go deeper into how we’re handling throughput, deduplication, or anything else.",

As a result, researchers and engineers often turn to costly U.S.-based supercomputers for their projects. Solidus AITECH aims to bridge this gap by building eco-friendly, on-continent HPC infrastructure tailored to Europe’s needs.\n\n**Why Now Is the Moment for HPC Innovation**\n\n* Demand is exploding: from AI training and genome sequencing to climate modeling and complex financial simulations, workloads now routinely require petaflops of computing power.\n* Digital sovereignty is central to the EU’s strategy: without robust local HPC infrastructure, true data and computation independence isn’t achievable.\n* Sustainability pressures are mounting: strict environmental regulations make carbon-neutral data centers powered by renewables and advanced cooling technologies increasingly attractive to investors.\n\n**Decentralized HPC with Blockchain and AI**\n\n* Transparent resource management: a blockchain ledger records when and where each compute job runs, eliminating single points of failure.\n* Token-based incentives: hardware providers earn “HPC tokens” for contributing resources, motivating them to maintain high quality and availability.\n* AI-driven optimization: smart contracts powered by AI route workloads based on cost, performance, and carbon footprint criteria to the most suitable HPC nodes.\n\n**Solidus AITECH’s Layered Approach**\n\n1. **Marketplace Layer:** Users can rent CPU/GPU time via spot or futures contracts.\n2. **AI-Powered Scheduling:** Workloads are automatically filtered and dispatched to the most efficient HPC resources, balancing cost-performance and sustainability.\n3. **Green Data Center (Bucharest, 8,800 ft²):** Built around renewable energy and liquid-cooling systems, this carbon-neutral facility will support both scientific and industrial HPC applications.\n\n**Value for Investors and Web3 Developers**\n\n* **Investors** can leverage EU-backed funding streams (e.g., Horizon Europe) alongside tokenized revenue models to optimize their risk-return profile.\n* **Web3 Developers** gain on-demand access to GPU-intensive HPC workloads through smart contracts, without needing to deploy or maintain their own infrastructure.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1. Launch comprehensive pilot projects with leading European research institutions.\n2. Accelerate integration via open-source APIs, SDKs, and sample applications.\n3. Design dynamic token-economy mechanisms to ensure market stability and liquidity.\n4. Enhance sustainability transparency through ESG reporting dashboards and independent audits.\n5. Build community awareness with technical webinars, hackathons, and success stories.\n\nBy consolidating Europe’s HPC capacity with a green, blockchain-enabled architecture and AI-driven orchestration, Solidus AITECH will strengthen digital sovereignty and unlock fresh opportunities for the crypto ecosystem. This vision represents a long-term investment in the continent’s digital future.",

    "content": "Organizations across all industries now heavily rely on data-driven insights to make decisions and transform their business operations. Effective data analysis is one essential part of this transformation. \n\nBut for effective data analysis, it is important that the data used is clean, consistent, and accurate. The real-world data that data science professionals collect for analysis is often messy. These data are often collected from social media, customer transactions, sensors, feedback, forms, etc. And therefore, it is normal for the datasets to be inconsistent and with errors.\n\nThis is why data cleaning is a very important process in the data science project lifecycle. You may find it surprising that 83% of data scientists are using machine learning methods regularly in their tasks, including data cleaning, analysis, and data visualization (source: market.us). \n\nThese advanced techniques can, of course, speedup the data science processes. However, if you are a beginner, then you can use Panda’s one-liners to correct a lot of inconsistencies and missing values in your datasets.\n\nIn the following infographic, we explore the top 10 Pandas one-liners that you can use for:\n\n• Dropping rows with missing values\n\n• Extracting patterns with regular expressions\n\n• Filling missing values\n\n• Removing duplicates, and more\n\nThe infographic also guides you on how to create a sample dataframe from GitHub to work on.\n\nCheck out this infographic and master Panda’s one-liners for [data cleaning](https://www.usdsi.org/data-science-insights/top-5-automation-tools-for-data-cleaning)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ici3zlxyl31f1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2ee9afe75b5ca50f454735bb5a51b2e83d3dc0\n\n\n\n",

Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, I developed a tool that allows users to ask questions about live terms of service or policies (e.g., Apple, Figma) and receive natural-language answers.\n\nThe aim isn’t to replace legal advice but to see if AI can make legal content more accessible to everyday users.\n\nIt uses a simple RAG stack:\n\n* **Scraper:** Browserless\n* **Indexing/Retrieval:** [Ducky.ai](http://Ducky.ai)\n* **Generation:** OpenAI\n* **Frontend:** Next.js\n\nIndexed content is pulled and chunked, retrieved with Ducky, and passed to OpenAI with context to answer naturally.\n\nI’m interested in hearing thoughts from you all on the potential and limitations of such tools. I documented the development process and [some reflections in this blog post](https://ducky.ai/blog/fineprint-how-to-build-a-legal-document-chat-with-ducky-ai?utm_source=reddit-bigdata&amp;utm_medium=community&amp;utm_campaign=technical-use_case)\n\nWould appreciate any feedback or insights!",

I've been researching an HPC Data Center that has several interesting points; which is useful information for Big Data. It's about r/solidusaitech Solidus AI Tech, a company focused on providing decentralized AI and sustainable HPC solutions, and also offers a platform with a Compute Marketplace, AI Marketplace, and AITECH Pad.\n\nAmong the points that I believe may be of interest to the Big Data community, the following stand out:\n\nAn eco-friendly HPC infrastructure located in Europe, focused on improving energy usage. This is important due to the high computational demand for AI solutions and effective access to large amounts of data.\n\nThe launch of Agent Forge during Q2 2025 sounds quite interesting; its essence is the creation of AI Agents without code, with the power to automate complex tasks. This is definitely a very useful point for analyzing data and other fields linked to Big Data.\n\nCompute Marketplace (Q2 2025) They also plan to launch a marketplace for accessing compute resources, which could be an option to consider for those looking for processing power for Big Data tasks.\n\nApart from this, they have announced strategic partnerships with companies like SambaNova Systems, a company that is inventing smarter and faster ways to use Artificial Intelligence in the business world. AITECH is also exploring use cases in Metaverse/Gaming. These sectors require large amounts of data.\n\nI would like to know your opinions on this type of platform that combines decentralized AI with sustainable HPC. Do you see potential in this approach to address the computational needs of Big Data and AI?\n\nPublication for informational purposes, please do your own research (DYOR). \n",

    "content": "Hey everyone! We’ve been working on a lightweight version of our data platform (originally built for enterprise teams) and we’re excited to open up a **private beta** for something new: **Seda**.\n\nSeda is a stripped-down, no-frills version of our original product, Secoda — but it still runs on the same powerful engine: custom embeddings, SQL lineage parsing, and a RAG system under the hood. The big difference? It’s designed to be simple, fast, and accessible for *anyone* with a data source — not just big companies.\n\n# What you can do with Seda:\n\n* **Ask questions in natural language** and get real answers from your data (Seda finds the right data, runs the query, and returns the result).\n* **Write and fix SQL automatically**, just by asking.\n* **Generate visualizations** on the fly – no need for a separate BI tool.\n* **Trace data lineage** across tables, models, and dashboards.\n* **Auto-document your data** – build business glossaries, table docs, and metric definitions instantly.\n\nBehind the scenes, Seda is powered by a system of **specialized data agents**:\n\n* **Lineage Agent**: Parses SQL to create full column- and table-level lineage.\n* **SQL Agent**: Understands your schema and dialect, and generates queries that match your naming conventions.\n* **Visualization Agent**: Picks the best charts for your data and question.\n* **Search Agent**: Searches across tables, docs, models, and more to find exactly what you need.\n\nThe agents work together through a smart router that figures out which one (or combination) should respond to your request.\n\n# Here’s a quick demo:\n\n📹 [Watch it in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny_3HUbt9zw)\n\n# Want to try it?\n\n📝 [Sign up here for early access](https://www.seda.ai/)\n\nWe currently support:  \n**Postgres, Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery, dbt (cloud &amp; core), Confluence, Google Drive, and MySQL.**\n\nWould love to hear what you think or answer any questions!",

It is very general topic because it purpose was to give me elasticity in choosing what i want to work on. I was thinking of building data lakehouse in databricks. I will be working on kinda small structured dataset (10 GB only) despite having Big Data in title as I would have to spend my money on this, but still context of thesis and tools will be big data related - supervisor said it is okay and this small dataset will be treated as benchmark.\n\nThe problem is that there is requirement for thesis on my universities that it has to have measurable research factor ex. for the topic of detection of cancer for lungs' images different models accuracy would be compared to find the best model. As I am beginner in data engineering I am kinda lacking idea what would work as this research factor in my project. Do you have any ideas what can I examine/explore in the area of this project that would cut out for this requirement?",

    "content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been exploring the challenges of working with large-scale data in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and one issue that keeps coming up is balancing **speed**, **efficiency**, and **scalability**, especially when dealing with massive datasets. So, **the startup I work for decided to tackle this** head-on by developing an **open-source RAG framework** optimized for high-performance AI pipelines.\n\nIt integrates seamlessly with **TensorFlow**, **TensorRT**, **vLLM**, **FAISS**, and more, with additional integrations on the way. Our goal is to make retrieval not just faster but also more cost-efficient and scalable. Early benchmarks show promising performance improvements compared to frameworks like **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex**, but there's always room to refine and push the limits.\n\n[Comparison for CPU usage over time](https://preview.redd.it/njud68kchtse1.jpg?width=2038&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea4f0d1774b9bee335487cb34cc391f997ec3c0d)\n\n[Comparison for PDF extraction and chunking](https://preview.redd.it/kqbwy3kchtse1.jpg?width=2038&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa14207f2099a4cd743bf0e75460cd09a15decd8)\n\nSince RAG relies heavily on vector search, indexing strategies, and efficient storage solutions, we’re actively exploring ways to optimize retrieval performance while keeping resource consumption low. **The project is still evolving**, and **we’d love feedback from those working with big data infrastructure**, **large-scale retrieval**, and **AI-driven analytics**.  \n  \nIf you're interested, check it out here: 👉 [https://github.com/pureai-ecosystem/purecpp](https://github.com/pureai-ecosystem/purecpp).  \nContributions, ideas, and discussions are more than welcome and if you liked it, **leave a star on the Repo!**",

Offers true autonomous operation\n\nIt is possible to use all these advantages successfully in the real world in the following sectors:\n\n* Financial Services\n* In social media content production\n* In research and development\n\nTo summarize briefly, Autonomys Network offers us a personal assistant that can produce solutions to many issues both in the web3 world and in our daily lives, thanks to its AI tools.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2rsf4hth7re1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19039f7e59cc608bd8a5ad758950045e9a1089bc\n\n",

    "title": "SECURITY OF DECENTRALIZATION AND AUTONOMYS NETWORK",
    "content": "One of the main problems we encounter in the basic design of the blockchain world is that only two of the three basic elements called the blockchain trilogy, namely centralization, security and scalability, can be optimized. Especially large blockchains make great efforts to establish a balance between these three. Usually, scalability is sacrificed and the concepts of decentralization and security come to the fore. This choice has caused them to experience problems such as high transaction fees and slow approval processes. Some networks have tried to establish this balance by sacrificing decentralization.  \n  \nAutonomys, on the other hand, aimed to establish a triple balance by shaping the network foundation with a new approach. By linking decentralization to security, Autonomys Network adopted a network structure that implements the archive proof of storage (PoAS) consensus mechanism to solve the blockchain trilogy, and aims to achieve hyper-scalability in the later stages and achieve balance between the elements of this trilogy.  \n  \nDECENTRALIZATION = SECURITY  \nDesigned as the most decentralized blockchain in the Web3 world, Autonomys Network uses disk storage as an easy-to-access hardware resource. It provides a high level of decentralization that has never been done before by using the storage capacity of every computer user's personal computer in the world. The more decentralization is provided, the more security will increase. This is the main goal.  \n  \nA feature that distinguishes the Autonomys Network project from others is that it uses historical data storage, which is actually seen as a big weight on the blockchain, as the primary security mechanism. Farmers share the load on the network thanks to their autonomous storage skills and abilities and each user becomes a part of the security by distributing it among many users. This provides the main decentralization and provides multiple security keys, which is the basic principle of security.  \n  \nWith all these qualifications, Autonomys Network has created a strong ecosystem by solving the basic problems that have been going on for a long time in the Web3 world with the most optional approach and solving them with secure, fast and more affordable network fees. Especially in this regard, I believe that advanced systems that will attract the attention of all interested users will bring a different level of development to the blockchain world by using autonomy at the highest level.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zezr75u5yzqe1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24e6a1df3ab851d46eef0a8133b27dd7e39cb7f9",

This collaboration isn't just about security; it's about unlocking new frontiers for developers and users alike. By embedding Proof of Humanity (PoH) into ApeChain, we’re making dApps more Sybil-resistant, governance more transparent, and digital identity more powerful than ever before.\n    With ApeChain as a zkProofer, developers on both Humanity Protocol and ApeChain can now build without limits. Whether it's creating DAOs that truly represent their communities, enabling NFT experiences tied to real human identities, or pioneering privacy-first DeFi solutions, the integration of Humanity Protocol’s identity layer changes the game. This integration is a fundamental shift that brings the digital and physical worlds closer together, setting a new standard for trust and utility in Web3.",

    "content": "Our state has statewide voter data including their voting history for the last six or seven elections.\n\nThe data rows are basic voter data and then there are like six or seven columns for the last six or seven elections.  In each of those there is a status of mail-in, in-person, etc.\n\nWe can purchase a data dump whenever we want and the data is updated periodically.  Notably not streaming data.\n\nSo....  massive number of rows.  Each update will have either have some updates or massive updates depending on the calendar and how close to election day.\n\nIf we use an 'always append' type of update the data set will grow crazy.  If we do an 'update' type of ingest then it might take a lot of time.\n\nThe analysis we want to end up with is a basic pivot table drilling down from our town, street, house, voters and then get the voting history for each voter.  If we had a reasonable excel sheet data file it would be trivial but we are dealing with massive data.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions for how to deal with this scenario?  I'm a tech nerd but not up to date on open source big-data tools.  ",

    "content": "I’m a junior data engineer, and I’ve been working on my first big project over the past few months. I wanted to share it with you all, not just to showcase what I’ve built, but also to get your feedback and advice. As someone still learning, I’d really appreciate any tips, critiques, or suggestions you might have!\n\nThis project was a huge learning experience for me. I made a ton of mistakes, spent hours debugging, and rewrote parts of the code more times than I can count. But I’m proud of how it turned out, and I’m excited to share it with you all.\n\n# How It Works\n\nHere’s a quick breakdown of the system:\n\n1. **Dashboard**: A simple steamlit web interface that lets you interact with user data.\n2. **Producer**: Sends user data to Kafka topics.\n3. **Spark Consumer**: Consumes the data from Kafka, processes it using PySpark, and stores the results.\n4. **Dockerized**: Everything runs in Docker containers, so it’s easy to set up and deploy.\n\n# What I Learned\n\n* **Kafka**: Setting up Kafka and understanding topics, producers, and consumers was a steep learning curve, but it’s such a powerful tool for real-time data.\n* **PySpark**: I got to explore Spark’s streaming capabilities, which was both challenging and rewarding.\n* **Docker**: Learning how to containerize applications and use Docker Compose to orchestrate everything was a game-changer for me.\n* **Debugging**: Oh boy, did I learn how to debug! From Kafka connection issues to Spark memory errors, I faced (and solved) so many problems.\n\nIf you’re interested, I’ve shared the project structure below. I’m happy to share the code if anyone wants to take a closer look or try it out themselves!\n\nhere is my github repo :\n\n[https://github.com/moroccandude/management\\_users\\_streaming/tree/main](https://github.com/moroccandude/management_users_streaming/tree/main)\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis project has been a huge step in my journey as a data engineer, and I’m really excited to keep learning and building. If you have any feedback, advice, or just want to share your own experiences, I’d love to hear from you!\n\nThanks for reading, and thanks in advance for your help! 🙏",

    "content": "I used to be an expert in Teradata, but I decided to expand my knowledge and master every database. I've found that the biggest differences in SQL across various database platforms lie in date functions and the formats of dates and timestamps.  \n  \nAs Don Quixote once said, “Only he who attempts the ridiculous may achieve the impossible.” Inspired by this quote, I took on the challenge of creating a comprehensive blog that includes all date functions and examples of date and timestamp formats across all database platforms, totaling 25,000 examples per database.  \n  \nAdditionally, I've compiled another blog featuring 45 links, each leading to the specific date functions and formats of individual databases, along with over a million examples.  \n  \nHaving these detailed date and format functions readily available can be incredibly useful. Here’s the link to the post for anyone interested in this information. It is completely free, and I'm happy to share it.  \n  \n[https://coffingdw.com/date-functions-date-formats-and-timestamp-formats-for-all-databases-45-blogs-in-one/](https://coffingdw.com/date-functions-date-formats-and-timestamp-formats-for-all-databases-45-blogs-in-one/)  \n  \nEnjoy!",

Although traditional Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have partially provided a solution to this issue, they cannot provide complete anonymity and an uncensored internet experience due to their centralized structures. u/AITECH uses blockchain technology with its new product AITECH VPN and offers an innovative solution to these problems. For those curious about AITECH IO, you can view all the information including the renewed whitepaper here. Let's continue. With its decentralized structure, NFT-based subscription system and compliance with Web3 security protocols, it provides users with true anonymity, complete security and unlimited internet access. So how will AITECH VPN offer us this?\n\n \n\nNFT-Based Subscription System\n\nAITECH VPN leaves traditional subscription models behind and comes up with an NFT-based system. Users will have NFT to access AITECH VPN. In this way, they will have easy internet access from anywhere they want. They will be free from the central control mechanisms of traditional VPNs. Thanks to an independent VPN subscription, they will not face any problems such as account closures etc. in the future. they will eliminate the risks.\n\n \n\nTrue Anonymity\n\nWhile traditional VPNs usually require an email and password, AITECH VPN works with a Web3-based authentication system. In other words, you do not need to enter any personal information when creating an account. Thus, data leaks, monitoring and security vulnerabilities are prevented.\n\n \n\nMore than 30 Global Server Locations\n\nAITECH VPN offers a fast and uninterrupted internet experience from anywhere in the world with more than 30 optimized servers located on different continents. In this way, you can access the content you want without losing your connection to the outside world even in censored regions.\n\n \n\nWeb3-Grade Security\n\nThanks to blockchain-based security protocols, AITECH VPN users are provided with maximum protection against surveillance, cyber attacks and data breaches. Thanks to its decentralized structure, your data is not stored on a single server and it is not possible for any authority to access it.\n\n \n\nWhy Should You Use AITECH VPN?\n\nAs we progress step by step towards decentralization in the blockchain world, we can use VPN without giving our personal information to anyone. We can use the internet all around the world without being stuck with constantly changing geographical or political restrictions. With AITECH IO technology, we can provide fast and secure connections on high-performance servers. Finally, thanks to its decentralization, we can use it comfortably.\n\nFor more details\n\n[https://docs.aitech.io/products/virtual-private-network](https://docs.aitech.io/products/virtual-private-network)\n\n \n\nAITECH VPN wants to provide its users with a free experience with decentralized technologies that shape the future of the internet. If you wish, you can check the conditions required for a secure internet experience here and register early.\n\n[https://docs.aitech.io/products/virtual-private-network#register-your-interest-now](https://docs.aitech.io/products/virtual-private-network#register-your-interest-now)\n\nBinance Source: [https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/20883222547242](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/20883222547242)\n\n \n\nThank you",

I have a database of 500k products, including names, images, prices, etc. The problem I'm facing is with search functionality. Because product names vary slightly between stores, I'm struggling to group similar products together.\nI'm currently using PostgreSQL with full-text search, but I can't seem to reliably group products by name. For example, \"Apple iPhone 13 128GB\" might be listed as \"iPhone 13 128GB Apple\" or \"Apple iPhone 13 (128GB)\" or \"Apple iPhone 13 PRO case\" in different stores.\nI've been trying different methods for a week now, but I haven't found a solution. Does anyone have experience with this type of problem? What are some effective strategies for grouping similar product names in a large dataset? Any advice or pointers would be greatly appreciated!!\n",

We previously used ArangoDB, but it couldn’t handle our 10K RPS requirements. To address this, I built a stack using Kafka, Flink, and Ignite. However, given my limited experience in some areas, there might be inaccuracies in my approach.\n\nAfter poc, we achieved low latency, but I'm now exploring alternative solutions. The developers need to execute queries using JDBC and SQL, which rules out using Redis. I’m considering the following alternatives:\n\n* **Azure Event Hubs with Flink on VM or Stream Analytics**\n* **Replacing Ignite with Azure SQL Database (In-Memory OLTP)**\n\nWhat do you recommend? Am I missing any key aspects to provide the best solution to this challenge?",

    "content": "Hey, I'm working on processing and extracting high quality training data from common crawl (10TB+). We have already tried using HuggingFace datatrove on our HPC with great success. The thing is fatatrove stores every in parquet or jsonl... but every step in the pipeline like adding some metadata requires duplicating the data with the added changes. And hence we are looking for a database solution with data processing engine to power our pipeline.\n\nI did some research and was convinced with Hbase+PySpark, since with Hbase we can change the scheme of the columns without requiring a full reminder like in cassandra. But I also read that doing a scan over all the database is slow. And I don't know if this will slowdown our data processing.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and what do you recommend?\n\nThank you!",

    "content": "Hey fellow data enthusiasts! 👋 I wanted to share my thoughts on a learning path that's worked really well for me and could help others starting their big data journey.\n\n**TL;DR**: Learning Hadoop (specifically MapReduce) before Spark gives you a stronger foundation in distributed computing concepts and makes learning Spark significantly easier.\n\n# The Case for Starting with Hadoop\n\nWhen I first started learning big data technologies, I was tempted to jump straight into Spark because it's newer and faster. However, starting with Hadoop MapReduce turned out to be incredibly valuable. Here's why:\n\n1. **Core Concepts**: MapReduce forces you to think in terms of distributed computing from the ground up. You learn about:\n   * How data is split across nodes\n   * The mechanics of parallel processing\n   * What happens during shuffling and reducing\n   * How distributed systems handle failures\n2. **Architectural Understanding**: Hadoop's architecture is more explicit and \"closer to the metal.\" You can see exactly:\n   * How HDFS works\n   * What happens during each stage of processing\n   * How job tracking and resource management work\n   * How data locality affects performance\n3. **Appreciation for Spark**: Once you understand MapReduce's limitations, you'll better appreciate why Spark was created and how it solves these problems. You'll understand:\n   * Why in-memory processing is revolutionary\n   * How DAGs improve upon MapReduce's rigid model\n   * Why RDDs were designed the way they were\n\n# The Learning Curve\n\nYes, Hadoop MapReduce is more verbose and slower to develop with. But that verbosity helps you understand what's happening under the hood. When you later move to Spark, you'll find that:\n\n* Spark's abstractions make more sense\n* The optimization techniques are more intuitive\n* Debugging is easier because you understand the fundamentals\n* You can better predict how your code will perform\n\n# My Recommended Path\n\n1. Start with Hadoop basics (2-3 weeks):\n   * HDFS architecture\n   * Basic MapReduce concepts\n   * Write a few basic MapReduce jobs\n2. Build some MapReduce applications (3-4 weeks):\n   * Word count (the \"Hello World\" of MapReduce)\n   * Log analysis\n   * Simple join operations\n   * Custom partitioners and combiners\n3. Then move to Spark (4-6 weeks):\n   * Start with RDD operations\n   * Move to DataFrame/Dataset APIs\n   * Learn Spark SQL\n   * Explore Spark Streaming\n\nWould love to hear others' experiences with this learning path. Did you start with Hadoop or jump straight into Spark? How did it work out for you?",

As social miners, we had a front-row seat to witness this milestone. This launch clearly showcased DAO Labs' community-focused vision.\n\nThrough this process, we saw just how impactful community-driven projects can be. DAO Labs has set a strong example for future project launches and has become a solid reference point for the community.",
