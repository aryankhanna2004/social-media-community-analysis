    "title": "Analyzing migration flows between EU countries and the rest of the world",
    "content": "As the title says, I'm analyzing migration flows to EU countries (including UK, so 28 countries) from the rest of the world, between 2011 and 2022. EU countries are also origin countries, while outside Europe I have considered macro-areas for various reasons (mainly, aggregates had fewer missing data and there are too many countries in the world). In the end, there are 62 origins.  \nSince I'm working with longitudinal data and count response, I've been using glmmTMB in R with family=nbinom2.  \nMigration flows are something you observe between a pair of countries, so the couples O-D are my units.  \nIn literature I've often seen fixed effects for origin, destination and year being used, but I think there are many things we cannot observe about the pairs, and I find reasonable to think there might be correlation between observations on the same pair.  \nIf I were to use a fixed effect for O-D that would absorb time-constant variables'effect (such as distance). Also, in a decade many things change, the unobserved heterogeneity's sources change, so I wanted to use random effects for O-D, destination and origin (fixed effects for years are fine).\n\nI wanted to ask, what are the proper checks I should make when fitting a GLMM with RE with glmmTMB in R? What should I look for and how should interpret the results?\n\nI know about the correlation between RE and regressors, but apparently I can't perform Hausman's test with a glmmTMB fit. So I grouped the regressors by origin/destination/O-D, averaged them and checked the correlation between the RE for origin/destination/O-D and the mean value of each regressor per country (example, (Germany's average population; Germany's RE as an origin country), (Italy's average population; Italy's RE as an origin country)... I defined these two columns, then checked the correlation. Then, same procedure for destination and O-D RE). If I get it right, I should check the correlation between a certain level RE and the regressors of that level (I shouldn't examine the correlation between destinations RE and origins' control of corruption, for example).  \nIf there is correlation I can apply Mundlak's correction.\n\nAnother thing, using multiple levels of RE it is important that the three levels of RE I'm using should be independent. How do I check this? I have 28 destinations RE, 61 for origins and more than a thousand for O-D pairs.  \nI only checked the correlation between the effects for the EU countries (they have both the destination and origin RE), and between destination and O-D RE, and between origin and O-D RE.  \nWhat should I do were I to find RE not independent?\n\n  \nSummary: fitting a GLMM to study migration flows (modeled as a negative binomial) to EU countries from other EU countries and the rest of the world, from 2011 to 2022. Inserting random effects for origins, destination, and pair of origin-destination countries.  \nWhat should I do to run the diagnostics of the model? How do I validate it? What should I check in order to say the results are fine and can be read, without them being biased by something I did wrong?  \nFeel free to ask me anything, I'm a student trying to make the best I can with only the basic knowledge I received about GLMM.\n\nThanks in advance",

In the past, submissions have mainly been based on the SAS language.\n\nIn recent years, the use of open source languages, especially the R language, has become very popular in the pharmaceutical industry and research institutions. Although the health authorities accept submissions based on open source programming languages, sponsors may be hesitant to conduct submissions using open source languages due to a lack of working examples.\n\nTherefore, the R Submissions Working Group aims to provide R-based submission examples and identify potential gaps while submitting these example packages.

    "title": "Dutch elections - how to do coalition cross-correlation?",
    "content": "*Background*: In about two weeks, the Dutch parliamentary elections will be held to vote for the House of Representative/House of Commons-equivalent (Tweede Kamer). There are &gt;20 parties in this election, with \\~12 of them having a chance of getting into the House. Since no party will ever have the required 76-seat majority, coalitions of parties need to be built to form the government.\n\nBased on some scraping of polls from Wikipedia and brute-force calculations, I can put together a dataframe of possible majority coalitions (&gt;75 seats, 5 or less coalition partners).\n\nThis looks like this:\n\n    &gt; majoritycoalitions\n    # A tibble: 329 × 3\n       partylist               numparties seatcount\n       &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n     1 PVV, GL/PvdA, CDA                3        79\n     2 PVV, GL/PvdA, CDA, D66           4        93\n     3 PVV, GL/PvdA, CDA, VVD           4        93\n     4 PVV, GL/PvdA, CDA, JA21          4        92\n\nThe first question that comes to mind is determining how many times a party is in all these coalitions, and I figured that out quickly.\n\nThe real question: how often do two parties join in a coalition? Thanks to an AI bot, I got this obvious piece of code involving a triple-nested loop, but it doesn't feel like the \"R way\" of doing things functionally.\n\n    party_matrix &lt;- matrix(0,\n        nrow = partycount,\n        ncol = partycount,\n        dimnames = list(election$parties, election$parties)\n    )\n    \n    \n    for (i in 1:nrow(majoritycoalitions)) { # nolint\n        parties &lt;- strsplit(majoritycoalitions$partylist[i], \", \")[[1]]\n        for (p1 in parties) {\n            for (p2 in parties) {\n                if (p1 != p2) {\n                    party_matrix[p1, p2] &lt;- party_matrix[p1, p2] + 1\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nAny ideas for a better and less convoluted way than 3 nested loops?\n\n  \nThe end result looks like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7yo45hfubvf1.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb0f46a5152fe4ce460e5b3ec8efec2ee0d82cb6\n\n",

    "content": "**Hey everyone,**\n\nI made a similar post here a while ago, but I’ve progressed a bit in my thinking and would love some feedback on my ideas.\n\nFor my PhD, I designed a study to investigate how a plant species responds to changing **light and temperature conditions**. This resulted in **12 experimental treatments**:\n\n* **Temperature:** 5 °C, 10 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C\n* **Light:** LL (low light), ML (mid light), HL (high light)\n\nWe measured traits such as growth and photosynthetic performance. The data are visualized in the figure with **boxplots** for each treatment, and I added **linear regression lines** to help visualize the direction of the effects.\n\n[LL = blue, ML = orange, HL = red](https://preview.redd.it/mp7dj1ws42vf1.png?width=644&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4681ea8be29ef77bb67ae44a01479acdc14298e5)\n\nStatistically, I’ve performed a **two-way permutational ANOVA** using the R package *permuco*. The results (effects and p-values) are printed in the bottom right of each plot.\n\nMy goal is to make statements like:\n\n“Parameter B is significantly affected by temperature and light, with median values suggesting that Parameter B is higher at higher temperatures and lower light intensity.”\n\nI’m wondering: **Is this level of interpretation sufficient**, or should I try to provide stronger statistical support?\n\nSo far, I’ve **avoided pairwise comparisons**, as I don’t know a good way to perform them after a permutational ANOVA in R. With 12 groups, I also face limitations:\n\n* Many significances disappear after correcting for multiple testing,\n* and with **n = 5 per group**, the statistical power is limited anyway.\n\nI’m mainly interested in **whether there is an effect and in which direction**, rather than precise pairwise differences.\n\nI’ve now characterized the light conditions more precisely:\n\n* HL = 226.5 µmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹\n* ML = 121.5 µmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹\n* LL = 93 µmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹\n\n(these are median values; the light field isn’t perfectly uniform).  \nWater temperature, on the other hand, is almost perfectly controlled.\n\nSo I’m considering whether I could treat **both variables as numeric**.  \nHowever, I’m unsure if that makes sense with only three light levels – or whether an **ANCOVA** would be better (temperature numeric, light as a factor).\n\nThe challenges I see are:\n\n* Light and temperature would then be treated *unequally*,\n* biologically, both are actually continuous,\n* and some parameters (not shown) likely follow **optimum curves** (e.g., increasing from 5 °C to 15 °C, then decreasing at 20 °C). Treating temperature as numeric could then miss these effects and reduce significance, even though that reflects biological reality.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n* Would you keep light and temperature as factors, or treat temperature (or both) as numeric?\n* How would you justify your choice statistically and biologically?\n* Is it reasonable to focus on the main effects from the permutational ANOVA and the direction of the medians, without pairwise comparisons?\n* **Or would you perhaps take a completely different approach?**\n\nThanks in advance for any input! 🙏",

It seems like the default x-axis scaling assumes log-transformed data (e.g., for odds ratios), so my mean difference of 21 is way off the visible range.\n\nHow can I properly rescale or center the x-axis so that all mean differences (0–22) are visible and the plot resembles a RevMan-style forest plot on the extreme right side with a linear scale, a null line at 0, and clearly visible confidence intervals ?\n\nThe data looks like this :\n\nn.e= number of patients in Experimental arm, n.c= number of patients in the Control arm\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73i1brzazhuf1.png?width=707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff67b2fb03bd970fc241771f18b4b49aad277099\n\n",

Folks with the previous version will get auto-updates, and anyone can [download the latest version here](https://www.lotas.ai/rao).\n\n* **Bring your own key option.** Users can input their own Anthropic and OpenAI API keys to code in Rao without ever signing in to Lotas. We've also added functionality to connect to on-premise models for sensitive data analysis (contact us if interested). One-click Lotas sign-in still works as before with 50 free queries per month.\n* **New models.** Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT 5 are now available.\n* **New context.** Users can attach previous chats and function documentation as context, and models can now choose to retrieve documentation and plots from the plots pane as needed.\n* **Auto-accept.** All model actions can now be put on auto-accept mode for faster editing or code running. Each type of action can have its automation configured individually, and users can specify lists of functions to allow (or deny) the model to run automatically.\n* **In-line change tracking.** On auto-accept mode, changes made by the model are tracked in-line for individual acceptance or rejection. Chat checkpoints allow users to undo any undesired changes or change and resend queries.\n* **Dark mode.** Dark mode and standard themes all work, providing an easy transition from other IDEs.\n* Code searching, file editing, and overall speed have been improved.\n\nAs always, we'd love any feedback and thoughts on what you want to see in the next version!\n\nWe're currently inviting users to alpha test our new secure, AI-centric data science IDE based on VS Code. It handles R, Python, and SQL with extensive data science and AI features. If you'd like to alpha test it, [add your email here](https://www.lotas.ai/erdos) and we'll send you the link!",

    "content": "I somewhat recently wrote a package that's a little in the same spirit as `callr`. Basically it lets the user run arbitrary R code snippets and functions in a separate R process that is running within a Docker container and returns the output to the user's current local R session. I'm obviously quite biased, but I actually think it's a pretty neat little package—though maybe it's a little bit more fun than useful. I'd be curious to get any thoughts, particularly on if others find this concept to be potentially useful? Currently the most helpful use case (at least that I have used it for) is making scientific research scripts easily replicable without requiring the replicator to locally install the full set of packages you used, etc.\n\n[https://github.com/dmolitor/jetty](https://github.com/dmolitor/jetty)",

    "content": "Hi everyone, I came across a recent *Nature Communications* paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49745-5/figures/6). In Figure 6h, the authors quantified the percentage of dead senescent cells (n = 3 biological replicates per group). They reported P values using a two-tailed Student’s t-test.\n\nHowever, the figure shows multiple treatment groups compared with the control (shControl). It looks like they ran several pairwise t-tests rather than an ANOVA.\n\nMy question is:\n\n* Is it statistically acceptable to only use multiple t-tests in this situation, assuming the authors only care about treatment vs control and not treatment vs treatment?\n* Or should they have used a one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test (which is designed for multiple vs control comparisons)?\n* More broadly, how do you balance biological conventions (t-tests are commonly used in papers with small n) with statistical rigor (avoiding inflated Type I error from multiple comparisons)?\n\nCurious to hear what others think — is the original analysis fine, or would reviewers/editors expect ANOVA in this case?",

    "content": "Hello R-users!\n\nI’m pleased to announce that the 'broadcast' R-package has been published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=broadcast).\n\n‘broadcast’ is an efficient ‘C’/‘C++’ - based ‘R’ package that performs “broadcasting” - similar to broadcasting in the ‘Numpy’ module for ‘Python’.\n\nIn the context of operations involving 2 (or more) arrays, “broadcasting” refers to efficiently recycling array dimensions without allocating additional memory.\n\nA Quick-Start guide can be found [here](https://tony-aw.github.io/broadcast/vignettes/b_quickstart.html).\n\nThe implementations available in 'broadcast' include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n* Broadcasted element-wise operations on any 2 arrays; they support a large set of relational, arithmetic, Boolean, string, and bit-wise operations.\n* A faster, more memory efficient, and broadcasted abind()-like function, for binding arrays along an arbitrary dimension.\n* Broadcasted ifelse- and apply-like functions.\n* Casting functions that cast subset-groups of an array to a new dimension, or cast a nested list to a dimensional list – and vice-versa.\n* A few linear algebra functions for statistics.  \n  \nBesides linking to ‘Rcpp’, ‘broadcast’ was developed from scratch and has no other dependencies nor does it use any other external library.\n\n[Benchmarks](https://tony-aw.github.io/broadcast/about/e_benchmarks_numpy.html) show that ‘broadcast’ is about as fast as, and sometimes even faster than, ‘NumPy’.\n\nIf you appreciate ‘broadcast’, consider giving a star to its [GitHub](https://github.com/tony-aw/broadcast) page.",

    "title": "R6 Questions - DRY principle? Sourcing functions? Unit tests?",
    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am new to R6 and I was wondering how to do a few things as I begin to develop a little package for myself. The extent of my R6 knowledge comes from the *Object-Oriented Programming with R6 and S3 in R* course on DataCamp. \n\nMy first question is about adherence to the DRY principle. In the DataCamp course, they demonstrated some getter/setter functions in the `active` binding section of an R6 class, wherein each private field was given its own function. This seems to be unnecessarily repetitive as shown in this code block:\n\n    MyClient &lt;- R6::R6Class(\n      \"MyClient\",\n      private = list(\n        ..field_a = \"A\",\n          ...\n        ..field_z = \"Z\"\n      )\n    \n      active = list(\n        field_a = function(value) {\n          if (!missing(value)) {\n            private$..field_a\n           } else {\n            private$..field_a &lt;- value\n           }\n        },\n          ...\n        field_z = function(value) {\n          if (!missing(value)) {\n            private$..field_z\n           } else {\n            private$..field_z &lt;- value\n           }\n        },\n      )\n    )\n\nIs it possible (recommended?) to make one general function which takes the field's name and the value? I imagine that you might not want to expose all fields to the user, but could this not be restricted by a conditional (e.g. `if (name %in% private_fields) message(\"This is a private field\")`) ?\n\nSecond question: I imagine that when my class gets larger and larger, I will want to break up my script into multiple files. Is it possible (or recommended?, again) to source functions into the class definition? I don't expect, with this particular package, to have a need for inheritance. \n\nFinal question: Is there anything I should be aware of when it comes to unit tests with `testthat`? I asked Google's LLM about it and it gave me a code snippet where the class was initialized and then the methods tested from there. For example, \n\n    testthat(\"MyClient initializes correctly\", {\n      my_client &lt;- MyClient$new()\n      my_client$field_a &lt;- \"AAA\"\n      expect_equal(my_client$field_a, \"AAA\")\n    })\n\nThis looks fine to me but I was wondering, related to the sourcing question above, whether the functions themselves can or should be tested directly and in isolation, rather than part of the class. \n\nAny wisdom you can share with R6 development would be appreciated!\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nAGranFalloon",

The response variable is blood concentration (ppm; ex: 0.005 - 0.03) and the two predictor variables are counts of different groups of food (ex: 0 - 12 items for group A).  The concentration data is right skewed.  The counts of food groups among subjects are also right skewed though closer to a normal dist. than the concentration data.\n\n1. Is it correct to say in the first pair of diagnostic plots, (QQ plot) the residuals deviate from the Normal family distribution used (KS test is significant) and (Qu Dev. plot) that the residuals have less variation than would be expected from the quantile simulation (the clustering of points between the 0.25 and 0.5, or even between 0.25 and 0.75)?\n2. Does anyone know of a good resource that discusses the limitations that are imposed on a glmm (ex: where assumptions are violated, etc.) when the response variable shows 'minimal' variation?  I log-transformed the response, the plots look good and I intuitively understand the issue with a response that may have little variation but am having trouble solidifying the idea conceptually.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bn6ug4fknxpf1.jpg?width=522&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=042e845a5e2d105f5e779c2700bc158b5e184b4e\n\n",

    "content": "A few people asked me how MCPR works and what it looks like to use it, so I made a short demo video. This is what conversational data analysis feels like: I connect Claude to my live R session and just talk to the data. I ask it to load, transform, filter, and plot—and watch my requests become reality. It’s like having a junior analyst embedded directly in your console, turning natural language intent into executed code. Instead of copy-pasting or re-running scripts, I stay focused on the analytical questions while the agent handles the mechanics.\n\nThe 3.5-minute video is sped up 10x to show just how much you can get done (I can share the full version if you request).\n\nPlease, let me know what do you think. Do you see yourself interacting with data like this? Do you think it will speed you up? I look forward to your thoughts!\n\n  \nIf you do data analysis and would like to give it a try, here is the repo: [https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR](https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR)\n\nSince this sub-reddit does not allow the use videos, I have placed the video in the MCP community: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1nk1ggp/mcpr\\_how\\_to\\_talk\\_with\\_your\\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcp/comments/1nk1ggp/mcpr_how_to_talk_with_your_data/)\n\nu/AI_Tonic  \nu/[techlatest\\_net](https://www.reddit.com/user/techlatest_net/)  \n\n\n",

    "content": "Hey community,\n\nI am a social sciences student and am conducting a statistical analysis for my term paper. The technical details are not that important, so I will try to explain all the important technical aspects quickly:\n\nI am conducting a hierarchical linear regression (HLM) with three levels. Individuals (level 1) are nested in country-years (level 2), which are nested in countries (level 3). Almost all of my predictors are at level 1, except for the variable `wgi_mwz`, which is at the country level. In my most complex model, I perform a cross-level interaction between a Level 1 variable and `wgi\\_mwz`. This is the code for the model:\n\n    hlm3 &lt;- lmer(ati ~ 1 + class_low + class_midlow + class_mid + class_midhigh + \n    wgi_mwz + \n    educ_low + educ_high + \n    lrscale_mwz + \n    res_mig + m_mig + f_mig + \n    trust_mwz + \n    age_mwz + \n    male + \n    wgi_mwz*class_low + wgi_mwz*class_midlow + wgi_mwz*class_mid + wgi_mwz*class_midhigh + \n    (1 | iso/cntryyr), data)\n\nThe result of `summary(hlm3)` ishows that the interactions are significant (p&lt;0.01). Since I always find it a bit counterintuitive to interpret interaction effects from the regression table, I plotted the interactions and attached one of those plots.\n\nMy statistical knowledge is not the best (I am studying social sciences at bachelor's level), but since the confidence intervals overlap, it cannot be said with 95% certainty that the slopes differ significantly from each other, which would mean that the `class_low` variable has no influence on the effect of `wgi\\_mwz` on `ati`. But the Regression output suggests that the Interaction is in fact significant, so I really dont know how to interpret this.\n\nIf anyone can help me, that would be great! I appreciate any help.",

    "content": "Hi All!\n\n  \nI'm plotting some of my likert data (descriptive percentages) using the likert package in r. I would consider myself a beginner with R, having learned a little in undergrad and stumbling my way through code I find online when I need to run a specific analysis. I have a few graphs (centered stacked bar charts) I've made using the likert package but I can't seem to change the text size from my values outside of the graph (x-axis, y-axis, and legend). I followed a tutorial online for the workaround using fake data because the likert package is really picky about each column having the same number of levels/values, so if a question never got a 1 on a likert scale it wouldn't run it. \n\nI've tried structuring it or changing it like you would ggplot but it only changes the percentages within the graph (showing percentage negative, neutral and positive responses). So my y-axis labels are quite small and I know I'll get asked to increase their text size for readability.

    "content": "**TL;DR:** AI agents for R are stateless and force you to re-run your whole script for a tiny change. I built an R package called MCPR that lets an AI agent connect to your live, persistent R session, so it can work with you without destroying your workspace. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR)\n\nHey everyone,\n\nLike many of you, I've been trying to integrate tools like Claude and Copilot into my R workflow. And honestly, it's been maddening.\n\nYou've got two terrible options:\n\n**The Copy-Paste Hell:** You ask a chatbot a question, it gives you a code snippet, you paste it into RStudio, run it, copy the result/error, paste it back into the chat, and repeat. It's slow and you're constantly managing context yourself.\n\n**The \"Stateless\" Agent:** You use a more advanced agent, but it just calls `Rscript` for every. single. command. Need to change a ggplot color theme? Great, the agent will now re-run the entire 20-minute data loading and modeling pipeline just for that one `theme()` call.\n\nI got so fed up with this broken workflow that I spent the last few months building a solution.\n\n# The Solution: MCPR (Model Context Protocol for R)\n\nMCPR is a practical framework that enables AI agents to establish persistent, interactive sessions within a live R environment. It exposes the R session as a service that agents can connect to, discover, and interact with.\n\nThe core of MCPR is a minimal, robust toolset exposed to the agent via a clear protocol.\n\n    # 1. Install from GitHub\n    remotes::install_github(\"phisanti/MCPR\")\n    MCPR::install_mcpr('your_agent')\n    # 2. Start a listener in your R console\n    library(MCPR)\n    mcpr_session_start()\n\nNow you can say things like:\n\n* \"Filter the results\\_df dataframe for values greater than 50 and show me a summary.\"\n* \"Take the final\\_model object and create a residual plot.\"\n* \"What packages do I have loaded right now?\"\n\nThe agent executes the code in your session, using the objects you've already created. No more re-running everything from scratch.\n\nThe project is still experimental, but the core functionality is solid. I believe this model of treating the IDE session as a long-lived server for an AI client is a much more effective paradigm for collaborative coding.\n\nI'm looking for feedback, especially on the protocol design and tool interface. Pull requests and issues are very welcome.\n\nGitHub (Source &amp; README): [https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR](https://github.com/phisanti/MCPR)\n\nThanks for checking it out. I'll be in the comments to discuss the implementation details.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/flj8a4s5p9pf1.gif\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, everyone,\n\nI recently lost my laptop and some important data, which has left me using a very slow, ancient one.\n\nThe problem is: I created high-resolution figures in the TIFF format using R for a manuscript. Unfortunately, these files were on my old laptop and are now gone. However, I have a Word document where I pasted these figures for documentation. When I tried to save the images from the Word file, their resolution was significantly reduced, making them unusable for publication.\n\nSo… My questions:\n\nIs there any method to recover these figures from the Word document in their original high-resolution quality and TIFF format?\n\nI still have my R script and .Rhistory files. Is there any way that the figures might be saved internally within R or an associated directory?\nThese might be a stupid questions, but I'm in a desperate situation with a tight deadline and would greatly appreciate any feedback, even if the answer is a simple \"no.“ , then, I will accept my fate, haha.\n\nThank you for your time in advance!",

    "content": "Hi everyone, thanks in advance for any hints!\n\nI’m analyzing an experiment where I test measurements in relation to temperature and light. I just want to know if there’s any effect at all.\n\n* **Light** is clearly a factor (HL, ML, ...). (called groupL)\n* **Temperature** is technically numeric (5, 10, ... °C), but in a two-way ANOVA it should probably be treated as a factor. (called temp)\n\nI noticed that using R, `anova_test()` and `aovperm()` give different results depending on whether I treat temperature as numeric or factor. From what I’ve read, when temperature is numeric, R seems to test for a linear increase/decrease — but that’s not really ANOVA, is it? More like ANCOVA?\n\nHere are example outputs from `aovperm()` with temperature as numeric vs factor. In both cases, the output is labeled “ANOVA.”\n\nTemperature numeric\n\n    Anova Table\n    Resampling test using freedman_lane to handle nuisance variables and 1e+06 permutations.\n                      SS df      F parametric P(&gt;F) resampled P(&gt;F)\n    temp         0.35266  1 1.6946           0.1976          0.1979\n    groupL       0.09831  2 0.2362           0.7903          0.7902\n    temp:groupL  0.37523  2 0.9015           0.4110          0.4121\n    Residuals   13.52697 65\n\nTemperature faktor\n\n    Anova Table\n    Resampling test using freedman_lane to handle nuisance variables and 1e+06 permutations.\n                     SS df      F parametric P(&gt;F) resampled P(&gt;F)\n    temp         0.4733  3 0.7109         0.549344        0.552214\n    groupL       3.2963  2 7.4267         0.001328        0.000959\n    temp:groupL  0.6860  6 0.5152         0.794456        0.797242\n    Residuals   13.0932 59\n\nAs a beginner in statistics, can someone explain this “chaos” in simple terms and confirm that using `as.factor()` for temperature is the safe approach when performing a two-way ANOVA?",

When I first started, I was totally lost with all the packages and weird syntax, but once things clicked, R became one of my favorite tools.\n\n1. Get Set Up\n\t•\tInstall R and RStudio (most popular IDE).\n\t•\tLearn the basics: variables, data types, vectors, data frames, and functions.\n\t•\tGreat free book: R for Data Science\n\t•\tAlso check out DataDucky – super beginner-friendly and interactive.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Work With Real Data\n\t•\tImport CSVs, Excel files, etc.\n\t•\tLearn data wrangling with tidyverse (especially dplyr and tidyr).\n\t•\tPractice using free datasets from Kaggle.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Visualize Your Data\n\t•\tggplot2 is a must – start with bar charts and scatter plots.\n\t•\tSeeing your data come to life makes learning way more fun.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Build Small Projects\n\t•\tAnalyze data you care about – sports, games, whatever keeps you interested.\n\t•\tShare your work to stay motivated and get feedback.\n\n⸻\n\nLearning R can feel overwhelming at first, but once you get past the basics, it’s incredibly rewarding. Stick with it, and don’t be afraid to ask questions here – this community is awesome.",

    "title": "oRm: an Object Relational Model framework for R update",
    "content": "straight to it: https://kent-orr.github.io/oRm/\n\nI submitted my package to CRAN this morning and felt inclined to share my progress here since my last post. If you didn't catch that last post `oRm` is my answer to the google search query \"sqlalchemy equivalent for R.\" If you're still not quite sure what that means I'll give it a shot in ~~a few sentences~~ the overlong but still incomplete introduction below, but I'd recommend you check the vignette [Why oRm](https://kent-orr.github.io/oRm/articles/why_oRm.html). \n\nThis list is quick updates for those following along since the last post. if you're curious about the package from the start, skip down a paragraph. \n\n- transaction state has been implemented in Engine to allow for sessions  \n- you can flush a record before commit within a transaction to retrieve the db generated defaults (i.e. serial numbers, timestamps, etc.)  \n- schema setting in the postgres dialect  \n- extra args like `mode` or `limit` were changed to use '.' prefix to avoid column name collisions, i.e. `.mode=` and `.limit=`  \n- `.mode` has been expanded to incldue `tbl` and `data.frame` so you can user `oRm` to retrieve tabular data in standardized way.  \n- `.offset` included in Read methods now makes pagination of records easy, great for server side paginated tables  \n- `.order_by` argument now in Read methods which allows for supplying arguments to a `dplyr::order_by` call (also helpful when needing reliable pagination or repeatable display)\n\n## So What's this `oRm` thing?\n\nIn a nutshell, `oRm` is an object oriented abstraction away from writing raw SQL to work with records. While tools like `dbplyr` are incredible for reading tabular data, they are not designed for manipulating said data. And while joins are standard for navigating relationships between databases, they can become repetitive and applying operations on joined data can feel... Well, I know I have spent a lot of time checking and double checking that my statement was right before hitting enter. For example:\n\n    delete from table where id = 'this_id';\n\nThose operations can be kind of scary to write at times. Even worse is pasting that together via R\n\n    paste0(\"delete from \", table, \" where id = '\" this_id, \"';\")\n\nThat example is very [where did the soda go](https://old.reddit.com/r/wheredidthesodago/), but it illustrates my point. What `oRm` does is makes such operations cleaner and more repeatable. Imagine we have a TableModel object (`Table`) which is an R6 object mapped to a live database table. We want to delete the record where id is `this_id`. In `oRm` this would look like:\n\n    record = Table$read(id == 'this_id', .mode='get')\n    record$delete()\n\nThe Table$Read method passes the `...` args to a `tbl` built from the TableModel definition, which means you can use native dplyr syntax for your queries because it *is* calling `dplyr::filter()` under the hood to read records. \n\nLet's take it one level deeper to where `oRm` really shines: relationships. Let's say we have a table of users and users can have valuable treasures. We get a request to delete a user's treasure. If we get the treaure's ID, all hunky dory, we can blip that out of existence. But what if we want to be a bit more explicit and double check that we arent' accidentally deleting another user's precious, unrecoverable treasures?\n\n    user_treasures = Users |&gt;\n        filter(id == expected_user) |&gt;\n        left_join(Treasures, by = c(treasure_id = 'id'))\n        filter(treasure_id == target_treasure_id)\n\n    if (nrow(user_treasures)) &gt; 0 {\n        paste0('delete from treasures where id = \"', target_treasure_id \"';\")\n    }\n\nIn the magical land of `oRm` where everything is easier:\n\n    user = Users$read(id == exepcted_user, .mode='get')\n\n    treasure = user$relationship('treasure', id == target_treasure_id, .mode='get')\n\n    treasure$delete()\n\nSome other things to note:\n\nEvery `Record` (row) belongs to a `TableModel` (db table) and tables are mapped to an `Engine` the connection. The Engine is a wrapper on a `DBI::dbConnect` connection, and it's initialization arguments are the same with some bonus options. So the same db connection args you would normally use get applied to the `Engine$new()` arguments. \n\n    conn = DBI::dbConnect(drv = RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = 'file.sqlite')\n\n    # can convert to an Engine via \n    engine = Engine$new(drv = RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = 'file.sqlite')\n\nTableModels are defined by you, the user. You can create your own tables from scratch this way, or you can model an existing table to use. \n\n    Users = TableModel$new(\n        engine = engine,\n        'users',\n        id = Column('VARCHAR', primary_key = TRUE, default = uuid::UUIDgenerate),\n        timestamp = Column('DATETIME', default = Sys.time)\n        name = Column('VARCHAR')\n    )\n\n    Treasures = TableModel$new(\n        engine = engine,\n        'treasures',\n        id = Column('VARCHAR', primary_key = TRUE, default = uuid::UUIDgenerate),\n        user_id = ForeignKey('VARCHAR', 'users', 'id'),\n        name = Column('VARCHAR'),\n        value = COLUMN('NUMERIC')\n    )\n\n    Users$create_table()\n    Treasures$create_table()\n\n    define_relationship(\n        local_model    = Users,\n        local_key      = 'id',\n        type           = 'one_to_many',\n        related_model  = Treasures,\n        related_key    = 'user_id',\n        ref            = 'treasures',\n        backref        = 'users'\n    )\n\nAnd if you made it this far: There is a `with.Engine` method that handles transaction state and automatic rollback. Not at all unlike a `with Sesssion()` block in sqlalchemy. \n\n    with(engine, {\n        users = Users$read()\n        for (user in users) {\n            treasures = user$relationship('treasures')\n            for (treasure in treasures) {\n                if (treasures$data$value &gt; 1000) {\n                    user$update(name = paste(user$data$name, 'Musk'))\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    })\n\nwhich will open a transaction, process the expression, and if successful commit to the db, if fail roll back the changes and throw the original error.",

    "content": "🚀 Excited to share our new R package for high-performance change-point detection, rupturesRcpp, developed as part of Google Summer of Code 2025 for The R Foundation for Statistical Computing. \n\nKey features:\n- Robust, modern OOP design based on R6 for modularity and maintainability\n- High-performance C++ backend using Armadillo for fast linear algebra\n- Multivariate cost functions — many supporting O(1) segment queries\n- Implements several segmentation algorithms: Pruned Exact Linear Time, Binary Segmentation, and Window-based Slicing\n- Rigorously tested for robustness and mathematical correctness\n\nThe package is in beta but nearly ready for CRAN. It enables efficient, high-performance change-point detection, especially for multivariate data, outperforming traditional packages like changepoint, which are slower and lack multivariate support. Empirical evaluations also demonstrate that it substantially outperforms ruptures, which is implemented entirely in Python.\n\nIf you work with time series or signal processing in R, this package is ready to use — and feel free to ⭐ it on GitHub! If you’re interested in contributing to the project (we have several ideas for new features) or using the package for practical problems, don’t hesitate to reach out.\n\nhttps://github.com/edelweiss611428/rupturesRcpp",

I have a codebase that looks like:\n\n    &gt; data_extraction\n      &gt; extract_1.R\n      &gt; extract_2.R\n    &gt; data_prep\n      &gt; prep_1.R\n      &gt; prep_2.R\n    &gt; modelling\n      &gt; ...\n    &gt; my_codebase.Rproj\n    &gt;.Rprofile\n\nEach script requires that its immediate parent directory be the working directory when running the script. Maybe not best practise but I'm working with what I have.\n\nThis is fairly easy to run in RStudio. I can run each script, and hit Set Working Directory when moving from one subdirectory to the next. After each script I can restart R to clear the global environment. Upon restarting R, I guess RStudio looks to the project root (as determined by the Rproj file) and finds/sources the .Rprofile.\n\nThis is not the case in Positron. If my active directory is `data_prep`, then when restarting the R session, .Rprofile will not be sourced. This is an issue when working with `renv`, and leads to an annoying workflow requiring me to run `setwd()` far more often.\n\n**Does anybody know a nice way around this? To get Positron to recognise a project root separate from the current active directory?**\n\nThe settings have a project option: `terminal.integrated.cwd`, which (re-)starts the terminal at the root directory only. This doesn't seem to apply to the R session, however.\n\nOptions I've considered are:\n\n* .Rprofile in every subdirectory - seems nasty\n* Write a VSCode extension to do this - I don't really want to maintain something like this, and I'm not very good at JS.\n* File Github issue, wait - I'll do this if nobody can help here\n* Rewrite the code so all file paths are relative to the project root - lots of work across multiple codebases but probably a good idea",

I always get frustrated when I have the occasional need to merge PDF files and/or remove or rotate certain pages. Like most others, our corporate-default Acrobat Reader does not have these built-in features (why?), and we cannot use external websites to handle any sensitive info.  \n\nCollectively, the world must've wasted many, many hours on this issue trying to find an acceptable workaround (e.g. finding a colleague that has the professional Adobe Acrobat, or wait for IT to install it on their own laptop).  \n\nIt's 2025 and no one else should suffer any more.  \n\nSo I've created an app called PDF Combiner that does exactly that. It is **fast, free, and secure**. Anyone with access to R can load this up locally in less than a minute, and no installation is required (other than a few common packages). Until Adobe decides to step up their game, this does the job.  \n\n🌐 [Online demo](https://lagom.shinyapps.io/PDF_Combiner/)  \n\n💻 [GitHub](https://github.com/stevechoy/pdfcombiner)",

I can read and analyze well?\n\nSo this is my dilemma and I find myself wanting to add another semester (I was supposed to graduate early this December so this wont really delay my plans, just my wallet) and take both an R-studio class and Python class.

    "content": "Hello.  I'm running several logistic regression mixed effect models, and I'm trying to interpret the simple effects of the significant interaction terms.  I have tried several methods, all of which yield different outcomes, and I do not know how to interpret any of them or which to rely on.  Hoping someone here has some experience with this and can point me in the right direction.\n\nFirst, I fit a model that looks like this:\n\nmodel &lt;- glmer(DV \\~ F1\\*F2 + (1|random01) + (1|random02)\n\nThe dependent variable is binomial.\n\nF1 has two levels: A and B.\n\nF2 has three levels: C, P, and N.\n\nI've specified contrast codes for F2: Contrast 1: (C = 0.5; P = 0.5; N = -1) and Contrast 2 (C = -1; P = 1; N = 0).\n\nThe summary of the model reveals a significant interaction between F1 and F2 (Contrast 2).  I want to understand the simple effects of this interaction, but I am stuck on how to proceed.  I've tried a few things, but mainly these two approaches:\n\n1. I created two data sets (one for each level of F1) and then fit a new model for each: glmer(DV \\~ F2 + (1|random01) + (1|random02).  Then I exponentiated the estimated term to determine the odds ratio.  My issue here is that I can't find any support for this approach, and I was unclear whether I should include the random effects or not.\n\n2. Online searches recommend using the \"phia\" package, and the \"testInteractions\" function, but the output gives me only a single value for the desired contrast when I'm trying to understand how to compare this contrast across the levels of F1.  I also don't know how to interpret the value or what units its in.\n\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated!  Thank you",

    "content": "Good afternoon,\n\nI am using R to run mixed-effects models on a rather... complex dataset.\n\nSpecifically, I have an outcome \"Score\", and I would like to explore the association between score and a number of variables, including \"avgAMP\", \"L10AMP\", and \"Richness\". Scores were generated using the BirdNET algorithm across 9 different thresholds: 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4 \\[...\\] 0.9.\n\nI have converted the original dataset into a long format that looks like this:\n\n      Site year Richness vehicular avgAMP L10AMP neigh Thrsh  Variable Score\n    1 BRY0 2022       10        22   0.89   0.88   BRY   0.1 Precision     0\n    2 BRY0 2022       10        22   0.89   0.88   BRY   0.2 Precision     0\n    3 BRY0 2022       10        22   0.89   0.88   BRY   0.3 Precision     0\n    4 BRY0 2022       10        22   0.89   0.88   BRY   0.4 Precision     0\n    5 BRY0 2022       10        22   0.89   0.88   BRY   0.5 Precision     0\n    6 BRY0 2022       10        22   0.89   0.88   BRY   0.6 Precision     0\n\nSo, there are 110 Sites across 3 years (2021,2022,2023). Each site has a value for Richness, avgAMP, L10AMP (ignore vehicular). At each site we get a different \"Score\" based on different thresholds.\n\nThe problem I have is that fitting a model like this:\n\n    Precision_mod &lt;- glmmTMB(Score ~ avgAMP + Richness * Thrsh + (1 | Site), family = \"ordbeta\", na.action = \"na.fail\", REML = F, data = BirdNET_combined)\n\nwould bias the model by introducing pseudoreplication, since Richness, avgAMP, and L10AMP are the same at each site-year combination.\n\nI'm at a bit of a slump in trying to model this appropriately, so any insights would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThis humble ecologist thanks you for your time and support!",

    "content": "I would like to share a research article we have published with the help of R+Quarto+`tidyverse`\\+`ggplot` on the public perception of AI in terms of expectancy, perceived risks and benefits, and overall attributed value.\n\nI don't want to go too much into the details, but people (N=1100, survey from Germany) tend to expect that AI is here to stay, but they see risks, limited benefits and low value. However, in the formation of value judgements, benefits are more important than the risks. User diversity influences the evaluations but age and gender effects are mitigated by data and AI literacy. If you’re interested, here’s the full article:  \nMapping Public Perception of Artificial Intelligence: Expectations, Risk-Benefit Tradeoffs, and Value As Determinants for Societal Acceptance, Technological Forecasting and Social Change (2025), [doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2025.124304](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2025.124304)\n\nIf you want to push the use of R to other science domains, you can also give us an upvote here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1mvd1q0/public\\_perception\\_of\\_artificial\\_intelligence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1mvd1q0/public_perception_of_artificial_intelligence/) 🙏🙈\n\nWe used `tidyverse` a lot for data cleaning and transforming the data into different formats. We study two perspectives: 1) Individual differences in form of a regular data matrix and 2) a rotated, topic-centric perspective with topic evaluations). These topic evaluations are spatially mapped as a scatter plot (e.g., *x*\\-axis for risk and *y*\\-axis for benefit) with `ggplot` and `ggrepel` to display the topics' labels on each point. We also used `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_violin()` plots to display the data. Technically, we munged through 300k data points for the analysis. \n\nI find the scatterplots a bit hard to read owing to the small font size but we couldn't come up with an alternative solution given the huge number of 71 different topics. While this article is published, we appreciate feedback or suggestions on how to improve the legibility of the diagrams (besides querying fewer topics:) The data and analyses are available on osf.\n\nI really enjoy these scatterplots, as they can be interpreted in numerous ways. Besides studying the correlation, e.g. between risks and benefits, one can meaningfully interpret the breadths and intercept of the data.\n\n[Scatterplot of the average risk \\(x\\) and benefit \\(y\\) attributions across the 71 different AI-related topics. There is a strong correlation between both variables.

My study is a 3 (Group; between) × 3 (Phase/Measurement; within) × 2 (Order of phase presentation; between) mixed design. \n\nI initially tried an R simulation, as I know that GPower is not very precise for mixed repeated-measures ANOVAs. However, my supervisors feel it is too complex and that we might be underpowered anyway, so, under the suggestion of our uni statistician, I am using a mixed ANOVA (repeated measures with a between-subjects factor) in GPower instead. We don't account for the within factor as he said it is implied in the repeated measure design.\nI’ve entered all the values (alpha, effect size, power) and specified 6 groups to reflect the Group × Order cells. \n\nMy question is: does the total sample size that G*Power returns assume equal allocation of participants across the 6 groups, or not?\nFrom what I understand, in G*Power’s repeated-measures ANOVA modules you cannot enter unequal cell sizes, so the reported total N should correspond to equal n per group. However, I’m not entirely sure. \nDoes anyone know of an explicit source or documentation that confirms this?\n\nThank you very much in advance ☺️",

Leveraging robust, time-tested technologies can enhance functionality and reliability without introducing unnecessary technical complications.\n\nSecond, acknowledge and embrace R’s role as a specialized programming language tailored for statistical computing and data analysis.

    "title": "Better Way to Calculate Target Inventory?",
    "content": "Update: Sorry, I did not realize that this subreddit was focused on R. Any help you can offer is likely beyond me, unfortunately.\n\nI am going to do my best to describe what my situation, but I am not much of a stats guy, so please bear with me and I will do my best to clarify whatever I can.\n\nI have been tasked with finding a better way to determine my company's monthly target inventory across all product lines (for what it's worth, we produce to stock, not to order) and to do it in Excel in such a way that it was fairly automatic. Apparently, target inventory was determined using mostly guesswork based on historical trends up until now.\n\nFrom my initial research, the basic formula I settled on was: T*arget Inventory = Avg Period Demand(Review Period + Lead time) + Safety Stock*\n\nMy supervisor and I went back and forth on refining the formula to fit our needs, and it was decided that for our *Average Period Demand* (which we are basing on monthly sales forecast numbers), would need to be weighted. Since we are looking at a year out for targeting, outlier months could throw off our EOY inventory. So the further away an individual month's forecasted sales are from the year's average, the lower its weight is. My supervisor also asked that months with 0 forecasted sales actually be weighted the same as months that are close to the average to ensure that we do not overproduce (we make perishable food products, so overproduction leads to waste quickly).\n\nThere are some more details I can fill in if need be, but in short my current problem is this:\n\nTo keep things consistent with our other reports, my supervisor stipulated that the sum of the Product Weighted Averages be equal to the weighted average of the Product Group (PG being the sum of each product therein). The problem is that when you total the weighted averages, they sometimes don't equal the weighted average of the Product Group. In my original spreadsheet, I speculate that this had to do with the weighted 0s, as groups without 0s DO total out properly. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to replicate this effect in an example sheet.\n\nEssentially, I need either a) a better way to take into account months with 0 forecasted sales that allows for my supervisor's stipulations, or b) an entirely different way to determine target inventory. Option A is preferred at this point, but I'll take what I can get.\n\nAny input is welcome!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b8i8ydmffvif1.png?width=1448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea2d04d9e530051b39c95f0be9584211c766ce07",

The background is that I’m trying to figure out when something is and isn’t moving based off the change in signal strength between its transmitter and a static receiver. I have a time series of detection data that I’ve trended so that points where the object is sitting still have a negative value and when it’s moving the points have positive values. I’ve graphed the cumulative sum of these points for easier visualization, and added notation where the thing is still or ‘on’ and moving or ‘off.’ \n\nWhat I’d like to do, and am seeking help to do so, is to figure out a way to make something akin to a rolling window that samples 20 points of data at a time, moving forward thru the data one point at a time. As it ‘crawls,’ I want it to track the up/down trend of points. If, after tracking negative values it comes across a positive one, I want it to track the next 10 points and if they are all positive, I want it to record the time of that first positive point and assign a value indicating a state change for the thing. \n\nI’d also like it to do the opposite and identify when the thing goes from moving (positive values) to sitting still (negative values). \n\nThis is all pretty complicated, definitely out of my wheelhouse but I need to get it done and could really use some help.

    "content": "Hi! I have doubt what would be the best solution to a simple research problem. I have data across 15 years and counts of admitted patients with certain symptoms for each year. The counts go from around 40 to around 100. That is 15 rows of data (15 rows, 2 columns). The plot shows a slight u-shaped relation between years (on x-axis) and counts on y-axis. Due to overdispersion I fitted a negative binomial model to model the count data, instead of poisson. I also included the quadratic year^2, so the model is count ~ year_centered +I( year_centered^2). And it fits better than the model with only year. The quadratic term is statistically significant and positive while the linear is not, although it's close. I have tried glmmTMB tom account for autocorrelation, but the models are virtually the same. My question is, can I trust the results from a negative binomial regression given my number of observations 15, and small degrees of freedom? Is this worth modeling or just showing the plot? Is there any other model that would be better suited for this scenario? \n\nHere is the output:\n\nCoefficients:\nEstimate Std.

Here's what's new since last time:\n\n* **Free tier at 50 queries per month.** Intended for people who might use Rao occasionally but found the single week trial too short.\n* **Zero data retention policies with Anthropic and OpenAI.** With the fact that we don’t store any data either, this means that *no user data whatsoever (code, data files, etc.) is stored or used to train models.*\n   * We continue to collect user analytics data by default, but we’ve added a `Secure mode` toggle to turn this off. We also have a `Web search` toggle that determines whether the assistant can search the internet.\n   * Our [security policy is here](https://www.lotas.ai/security).\n* **Single-click sign-in.** A `Sign in/Sign up` button will automatically sign you in on the app (no more manual API keys). Your key will be securely stored locally to keep you logged in between sessions.\n* **Rao rules.** You can specify a set of instructions the model should follow. This will always be provided to the model when you make queries.\n* **Automatic app updates.** The app will fetch new updates when available and install them automatically so you stay up to date with our latest features and bug fixes.\n* **Demo datasets.** We’ve included [6 demo datasets](https://github.com/lotas-ai/rao/tree/main/demos) in the Rao GitHub that you can try out to get started. Topics range from a metagenomic analysis of Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis to comparing energy access across African countries. Each demo only takes 1-2 queries.\n* **Search/replace.** We’ve provided the models with a search and replace function for more precise code edits that also allows users in Secure mode to use the app without calling our third party provider for fuzzy edits.\n* **Merged RStudio updates** All updates made to RStudio through late July are merged in, so anything you do in RStudio should work in Rao.\n* Other robustness and speed updates…\n\nWould love any feedback and thoughts on what you want to see in the next version!",

However when I ask AI for suggestions on why it is nonetheless returning a negative sign it tells me the first part of the SMCC formula is just m1i - m2i, so to fix this I should just put the higher value in m1i if I want the sign to be correctly positive. I ask it why the documentation would say the opposite and it says the documentation is wrong. I don't dare trust AI over the actual documentation, just wanted it to give some suggestions, and it literally just suggests the documentation is misleading/ wrong. What is going on here?

    "title": "oRm: An object relational model framework for R",
    "content": "`oRm` is inspired by sqlalchemy. I kept wanting to reach for an ORM solution to provide a backend for things like interactive shiny tables or reproducible data entry. So, as they say \"be the change you want to see in the world.\" For those not previously introduced to ORM, it's an object oriented approach to CRUD operations via objects (rows) and their related data (foreign keys).\n\nYou can think of `oRm` like a wrapper that takes your tried and true `DBI` connection methods and `dbplyr` filtering syntax to make `R6` mutable objects. And once you have your objects, the real magic happens in the relationships. \n  \nyou can jump straight to the pkdown site [here](https://kent-orr.github.io/oRm/).\n\nA couple of points to get out of the way before I give an example:\n\n- This package is not for analysis and statistical work, it's not for reading large tables (though it can), and it doesn't seek to improve on or compete with `dbplyr,` in fact I use `dbplyr` under the hood so I can rely on their dialect agnostic syntax as much as possible.  \n- Yes, `reticulate` does make sqlalchemy very easy to port into any R work. But what if you just don't know python very well, and / or don't want a `.Renviron` and a `.env`, and `.renv/` and a `.venv/` in your project?  \n\nAnd a couple of features that I'm not going to get to in this post, but are likely to interest some people:\n\n- with.Engine allows for a managed transaction state with automatic rollback in case of failure.  \n- on delete and on update support for related objects.  \n- Some dialect specific support, for example making use of a flush() method and `RETURNING` for postgres backends.  \n\n## Okay, now show me what it looks like\n\nSure thing. `oRm` uses a few key objects:\n\n- Engine: your db connection\n- TableModel: a model representing a sql table  \n- Record: an object that represents a row in a table\n- Relationships: mappings between TableModels that define how observations are linked together. \n\nThe example below is based on the idea of having a data team entering measurements of plant heights during the course of an experiment.\n\n## Engine\n\nThe engine uses `DBI` under the hood. So the syntax should be very familiar, some might even say the exact same to what you're used to. This example uses SQLite, but you should be able to plop whatever driver you want in there. \n\n    library(oRm)\n    \n    engine &lt;- Engine$new(\n      drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),\n      dbname = \":memory:\",\n      persist = TRUE # this arg is sqlite memory specific, not always needed\n    )\n\nYour engine will manage opening and closing connections for you. You can also implicitly create a managed pool with the argument `use_pool=TRUE`. There are a few methods that you might find useful from your engine itself, but for the most part you just define it and leave it be. \n\n## TableModel\n\nYou can use the `TableModel$new()` method, but I like the hierarchical structure of building my table model off the `engine` it relies on. Defining a TableModel you give a table name and a list of Columns. \n\n    Measurements &lt;- engine$model(\n      tablename = \"measurements\",\n      id = Column(\"INTEGER\", primary_key = TRUE),\n      observer_id = Column(\"INTEGER\"),\n      plant_id = ForeignKey(\"INTEGER\", references = 'plants.id'),\n      measurement_date = Column(\"DATE\"),\n      measurement_value = Column(\"REAL\")\n    )\n    Measurements$create_table()\n\n## Records\n\nAgain, you can define a `Record$new()` but I like to make my records from the TableModel they came from. \n\n    m1 = Measurements$record(\n      observer_id = 1,\n      plant_id = 101,\n      measurement_date = as.Date(\"2025-07-30\"),\n      measurement_value = 14.2\n    )\n    # and after we have m1, we need to explicitly create it in the db\n    m1$create()\n\nAt this point, we have our object representing a single row. If you go no further, this will give you CRUD functionality at the row level. The methods assigned to a Record are named to align with CRUD:\n\n\n    m1$create()\n    m1$update(measurement_value = 15)\n    # m1$delete()\n\nThe 'R' belongs to the table, since you're reading from there. Here's an example to get our m1 object from the table itself. You can use dbplyr filter syntax here. \n\n    m1_read = Measurements$read(observer_id == 1, mode = 'get')\n    m1_read\n\nIf you've gotten this far, I'm going to consider you formally interested and refer you to the pkdown site for seeing the [Relationships](https://kent-orr.github.io/oRm/articles/why_oRm.html#relationships) in action. This post mirrors that documenation, so you'll pick up right where you left off here.",

Let's say that the actual relationship between Cl- and conductivity is a prefect correlation.\n\nWhen the sample size is small, I would imagine that the data in the field will a much larger p-value, as though the 2 are actually perfectly correlated, the residuals from field data will be a lot larger (due to omitted variables\\*), so the p-value of the coefficient will be a lot smaller.

Then, I ran a second model, a constrained one, in which I fixed the **indirect effects** across the age groups. Last, I run a Likelihood Ratio (LRT) to test whether the constrained model is a better fit, and the answer is no.\n\nI extensively wrote up the statistical results of the unconstrained model, then shortly the model fit indices of the constrained one, to later compare them with the LRT.\n\nAre these steps appropriate for my research question?\n\nSo the first model was a good fit, the second as well, and the LRT revealed that the model did not improve, so there is no difference in indirect effects when comparing the age groups.",

    "content": "If anyone here is interested in fantasy basketball, I just uploaded my R code for fantasy basketball to help prepare rosters for the playoffs throughout the season. The full description of the code and the github link are below:\n\nThe purpose of this code is to help show the impacts of adding/subtracting players on the fantasy basketball playoffs. This can used be throughout the entire season to help keep an eye on the layout of the different schedules your players have during the playoffs to help with decisions involving player aquisitions. The idea is that you want to minimize the number of times you have to leave a player on the bench because your lineup is full. If you can start up to 8 people per day, then every time you have more than 8 players with a game in one day, you're essentially wasting the points for all the extra players you have to put on your bench. It would be optimal to instead have the starts spread out as much as possible (given that the total number of starts remains the same). This code shows, in a number of different ways, which team's schedule would best fit the schedules of the players currently on your team, as well as which players on your team have schedules that are not optimal compared to the rest of your team.\n\nThis code is specifically designed for the format of the league that I'm in, which is a points league with 8 lineup spots (5 pos 3 flex), but the code could be adjusted for cat leagues and/or different lineup settings as well. The league I'm in also has contracts that are bid on, rookie drafts, etc., so player additionals/subtractions are less frequent than in a regular redraft league (making this code more necessary), but that doesn't impact how the code is used.\n\n  \n[https://github.com/kevinwaite45/fantasy-basketball](https://github.com/kevinwaite45/fantasy-basketball)",

That creates a false sense of security.\n\nRecently, I discovered **mutation testing** as a practical way to address this gap, and that's how muttest was created.\n\nHow {muttest} works:\n\n1. **Define a set of code changes (mutations).**\n2. **Run your test suite against mutated versions of your source code.**\n3. **Measure how often the mutations are caught** (i.e., cause test failures).\n\nWhat mutation testing reveals:\n\n* **0% score:** Your tests pass no matter what changes - your assertions are weak.\n* **100% score:** Every mutation triggers a test failure - your tests are robust.\n\n`{muttest}` provides not just a mutation score, but **identifies which files have tests needing stronger assertions**.\n\nCurrently only binary operator mutations are implemented, but more are on their way!\n\nI’ve already used it in my projects and it helped me improve my tests, maybe it’ll help you too?",

R beginner here!\n\nI would like to ask you for recommendations on how to fix the plot I show below.\n\n\\# What I'm trying to do:   \nI want to compare compare language production data from children and adults. I want to compare children and adults and older and younger children (I don't expect age related variation within the groups of adults, but I want to show their age for clarity). To do this, I want to create two plots, one with child data and one with the adults.\n\n\\# My problems:\n\n1. adult data are not evenly distributed across age, so the bar plots have huge gaps, making it almost impossible to read the bars (I have a cluster of people from 19 to 32 years, one individual around 37 years, and then two adults around 60).\n2. In a first attempt to solve this I tried using scale\\_x\\_break(breaks = c(448, 680),   scales = 1) for a break on the x-axis between 37;4 and 56;8 months, but you see the result in the picture below.\n3. A colleague also suggested scale\\_x\\_log10() or binning the adult data because I'm not interested much in the exact age of adults anyway. However, I use a custom function to show age on the x-axis as \"year;month\" because this is standard in my field. I don't know how to combine this custom function with scale\\_x\\_log10() or binning.\n\n\\# Code I used and additional context: \n\nIf you want to run all of my code and see an example of how it should look like, check out the link.

This data had enhanced QA applied to them both in the ArcGIS Survey123 interface and via the integration with R and Python-based QA and Posit Connect hosted shiny applications.

    "content": "Working on an example to demonstrate correlation and randomness in data using visual models.\n\nI'm trying to find a dataset that would produce 8-12 Chernoff faces with the broadest range of \"features\" to the data. For example, [Flowing Data instructions](https://flowingdata.com/2010/08/31/how-to-visualize-data-with-cartoonish-faces/) use crime data by U.S. state. This data often demonstrates correlations that lead to similar \"features\" between samples. It makes sense that this data would show multiple correlations since similar kinds of crime rates would result from similar sociopolitical conditions across states. \n\nFor an example, see below. This data could be grouped as 4 and 10 having similar features based on shape and color, 6, 8, and 9 having similar features, and 5, 7, 11, and 12 serving in their own category. I'd like to find a data set that is least correlative, meaning that the features and colors will be seemingly random for the 8-12 faces.\n\nAny suggestions or could someone offer random data? It doesn't need to be a \"real\" data set to demonstrate the statistical phenomenon.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfib3bgp6s9f1.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc2a8869b32e2e8e414825f340ac856dbe012a36",

    "content": "Hi! \n\nI hope someone have the time to help with a question I have, I have searched and tried anything I could think of (that is not much since I don't have many hours behind me in R), but I am stuck. I am taking a distance course in R and have no teacher to ask over the weekend, so I hope someone can point me in the right direction. I am not after a solution, just getting pointed in the right direction. so I can get my code working. \n\n\n\nThe task I have at hand.\n\n1. Write a function that the square root of the sum of squares of two number.

Write a function that takes coordinates from 2 different dataframes (m1 and m2 3 points from each) and calculates the distance between every point in dataframe 1 and 2, so a total of 9 distances, and returns the result in a 3\\*3 matrix. \n\nEverything in 3 is done except getting it to a 3\\*3 matrix. When I try to output it it only goes into a list. \n\n\\#Defining dataframes with x &amp; y coordinates.   \nm1 &lt;- data.frame(x1 = c(5,6,7), y1=c(4,5,6))\n\nm2 &lt;- data.frame(x2 = c(1,2,3),  y2=c(2,4,6))\n\n**Distance\\_matrix = function(m,n)**{\n\n\\#Defining an output matrix\n\noutput &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = nrow(m), ncol = nrow(n))\n\n  \\# A counter just to see where I am in the loop  \n\n  k &lt;-1\n\n  for (i in 1:nrow(m)) {\n\nfor (j in 1:nrow(n)) {\n\noutput\\[i,j\\] &lt;-  Distance(m\\[i,\\], n\\[j,\\])\n\nprint(paste(\"Loop :\",k, \" i:\", i, \" j:\",j))\n\nprint(output)\n\nk &lt;- k+1\n\n}\n\n  }\n\n   return(output)\n\n}\n\n  \nIf I use just single points from the dataframes in the function Distance\\_matrix and take xy from m1 and m2, both from row 1 and it works. \n\n    &gt; x &lt;- Distance_matrix(m1[1,],m2[1,])\n    [1] \"Loop : 1  i: 1  j: 1\"\n            x2\n    1 4.472136&gt; x &lt;- Distance_matrix(m1[1,],m2[1,])\n    [1] \"Loop : 1  i: 1  j: 1\"\n            x2\n    1 4.472136\n\nIf I modify inside of the Distance\\_matrix function output\\[i,j\\] &lt;-  Distance(m\\[i,\\], n\\[j,\\]) to output &lt;-  Distance(m\\[i,\\], n\\[j,\\]) it goes thru all the points and I get a all 9 distances calculated but I only get the last calculated as an output.\n\nIf I try this output\\[i,j\\] &lt;-  Distance(m\\[i,\\], n\\[j,\\]) inside of the Distance\\_matrix function and the variable output is defined as a matrix \n\n    output &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = nrow(m), ncol = nrow(n))output &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = nrow(m), ncol = nrow(n))\n\nThe variable output is transformed to a list, and the function will not work.

If someone can point me in the right direction, I would be thankful. \n\nI have searched for a solution, but it seems that I only find \"If you are dealing with a vector, then you fix it by simply removing the comma\" but since I am (at least trying) working with a matrix, that will not fix it.

I have very elementary CS knowledge from taking a AP CS class way back in high school and know the basic principles of CS but I have never really been able to learn a text based language.\n\nAdditionally, I have basic college stats knowledge and I am looking to use this for biological research in the future (not anything too fancy because I am pre-med and not aiming to go into research full time). Not trying to rush the fundamentals ofc but what are the best ways to go about learning R? Also, will I have to learn any other language along with this? I've heard people mention that they had to use Python and SQL along with R not specifically for this course but in general for biological research.\n\nedit: tysm to everyone for all the options! i really appreciate it :)",

    "content": "R is an amazing programming language, and I really enjoy coding with it. It remains unmatched in statistics thanks to its large ecosystem for that purpose. However, we have entered an era where everyone only talks about AI (LLMs), and many packages are moving in this direction [there are at least 30 such packages](https://luisdva.github.io/llmsr-book/r-pkgs.html).\n\nWhile the enthusiasm is impressive, I wonder if we might be overlooking other ideas that could be more useful for the community? For example, I'm surprised there isn't an equivalent to Python's Transformers library. Are there other themes that deserve our attention?\n\nSo, I am interested in your opinion. What kind of package do you need? Is there a package that you appreciate but deserves more recognition? It would be great if you could answer these questions while specifying your profession and/or current use of R. For example:\n\n\"I am a Geography researcher, and I work extensively on 3D map visualization. It would be useful to have a package that... We don't talk enough about the package...\"\n\nThank you in advance!",

I want to understand what mediated the effect of an intervention on the outcome in an RCT (intervention N = 78 vs waitlist-control N = 80). I have my data at three time points: pre, post (8 weeks) and follow-up (3 months) and several potential mediators. In my spaghetti plots I see that the change in my variables happened between T1 and T2 both in the mediators and outcome and than remained more or less stable until follow-up. Does this suggest that I should stick to a two-wave mediation (pre-post) or is there value in conducting a three-wave mediation? In case of three-wave mediation I am thinking of Cross-lagged Mediation or Parallel Latent Growth Curve Model, but I would use Sum Scores of my questionnaires, as modeling latent factors with my items would be too complex for my sample size. Would such an approach be fine? Do you have any suggestions for conducting a mediation analysis given my study design? I am grateful for any insights!",

    "content": "Hi everyone,  \n​​​​​​​  \nI’m conducting an analysis on the impact that receiving a Michelin star has on the opening of new business ventures associated with a restaurant. The database covers the full history of each restaurant, from its opening year (which varies by restaurant) to the present. It includes the number of associated businesses in each year, the year (if any) in which the restaurant received a star, its location, and the type of ownership. There’s also a 1:1 control group consisting of restaurants that were never included in the guide but are otherwise similar to the treated ones.  \nAt the moment, I’m considering a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach. I started with a classical 2x2 DiD, using a window of two years before (to account for potential anticipation effects) and five years after the treatment for each restaurant. However, this approach is overly simplistic since the year of treatment (i.e., when the star is awarded) varies across restaurants, which introduces well-known identification issues. I'm therefore considering the Callaway and Sant’Anna ATT estimator, which allows for an event-study-style analysis and better handles the staggered nature of the treatment.  \nMy main concerns revolve around  \n•    the staggered timing  \n•    the unbalanced nature of the panel some restaurants have data covering the full observation period (e.g., one opened in 1960 with treatment in 2009 has data from 2000 to 2024), while others like one opened in 2007 lack earlier years. I can't simply fill in missing pre-opening years with zeros for diversification, as that would bias the analysis.)   \n•    the dependent variable: the number of business ventures is cumulative, meaning it either increases or remains constant. One possible solution is to use the year-over-year difference, but the numbers are very small, and I’m worried about losing meaningful signals.\n\nI'm using this package for Callaway [https://github.com/bcallaway11/did](https://github.com/bcallaway11/did)\n\nAny suggestions or references to similar work would be very welcome.",

With the introduction of the sf package, R became home to a first-class spatial data frame API. \n\nA growing number of R users, however, need to scale beyond the capabilities of sf. \n\nThis webinar will cover three broad categories of techniques to scale spatial workflows in R, including (1) ensuring that sf code is appropriately using features targeted at larger analyses, (2) using libraries that provide lower-level access to the primitives on which sf builds, including s2, wk, and geos, and (3) using database connectors and in-memory databases to write spatial SQL and perform computations in engines like PostGIS, DuckDB, and Apache Sedona. \n\nFinally, this webinar will provide an overview of the technologies that underlie these techniques, including GeoArrow, GeoParquet, and Apache Iceberg.\n\nSpeaker: \n\nDewey Dunnington, Senior Software Engineer at Wherobots\n\nDewey Dunnington (Ph.D., P.Geo.) is a software engineer and geoscientist based in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

    "content": "Please forgive me if my question is very basic, I'm only just starting to learn how to use R.\n\nTo give you some background, a CTD was used to obtain a high resolution vertical profile of the Arctic water column (temp, chlorophyll, depth, salinity) over 15 days. Using the plots below I can guesstimate what the thermocline and halocline was each day but for my research I want to properly calculate the exact depth at which those gradients occur. \n\nAfter searching for a while I found the rLakeAnalyzer package (https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/rLakeAnalyzer/html/thermo.depth.html). While this seems to be more geared towards calculating the thermocline in lakes, I want to at least see how it'd fare with my dataset.\n\nI'm however having a hard time figuring how to format my data for analysis by this package. Below is a screenshot of what my excel sheet looks like and as you can see depth was recorded every 0.167s from the surface to the seabed (\\~125m), resulting in a large number of values. Given how large my dataset is, it needs to be loaded using [load.ts](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/rLakeAnalyzer/help/load.ts.html), but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to organize my data into a file that can be read by this package.\n\n  \nDoes anyone have any ideas as to how I could format my data or any suggestions for other packages that may allow me to identify the depth of the thermocline, halocline and mixed layer.\n\n[ This is the vertical profile of temperature as the CTD moved down the water column. The number at the top indicates the day when the CTD was deployed. ](https://preview.redd.it/bwiud9s3xc5f1.png?width=2864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06afdae753d10823b87fed3f4998c5a5f6c13e7b)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nkcmov9lxc5f1.png?width=2862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbea30b1480a74be84255197c8bbbdc98404b9a5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tobrxexkyc5f1.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34692163856cf3f3cdccff935fc5555394df0984\n\n  \n",

    "title": "Introducing diffuseR - a native R implementation of the diffusers library!",
    "content": "[diffuseR](https://github.com/cornball-ai/diffuseR) is the R implementation of the Python diffusers library for creating generative images. It is built on top of the torch package for R, which relies only on C++. No Python required! This post will introduce you to diffuseR and how it can be used to create stunning images from text prompts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hphc91ondj4f1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea90f3fbfc12eb1139df936d68ba60b28803a8d6\n\n# Pretty Pictures\n\nPeople like pretty pictures. They like making pretty pictures. They like sharing pretty pictures. If you've ever presented academic or business research, you know that a good picture can make or break your presentation. Somewhere along the way, the R community ceded that ground to Python. It turns out people want to make more than just pretty statistical graphs. They want to make all kinds of pretty pictures!\n\nThe Python community has embraced the power of generative models to create AI images, and they have created a number of libraries to make it easy to use these models. The Python library [diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) is one of the most popular in the AI community. Diffusers are a type of generative model that can create high-quality images, video, and audio from text prompts. If you're not aware of AI generated images, you've got some catching up to do and I won't go into that here, but if you're interested in learning more about diffusers, I recommend checking out the [Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) or the [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239).\n\n# torch\n\nUnder the hood, the diffusers library relies predominantly on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) deep learning framework. PyTorch is a powerful and flexible framework that has become the de facto standard for deep learning in Python. It is widely used in the AI community and has a large and active community of developers and users. As neither Python nor R are fast languages in and of themselves, it should come as no surprise that under the hood of PyTorch [\"lies a robust C++ backend\"](https://medium.com/@pouyahallaj/libtorch-the-c-powerhouse-driving-pytorch-ee0d4f7b8743). This backend provides a readily available foundation for a complete C++ interface to PyTorch, [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/cppdocs/). You know what else can interface C++? R via [Rcpp](https://rcpp.org/)! Rcpp is a widely used package in the R community that provides a seamless interface between R and C++. It allows R users to call C++ code from R, making it easy to use C++ libraries in R.\n\nIn 2020, Daniel Falbel released the [torch](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/) package for R relying on libtorch integration via Rcpp. This allows R users to take advantage of the power of PyTorch without having to use any Python. This is a fundamentally different approach from [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/) for R, which relies on interfacing with Python via the `reticulate` package and requires users to install Python and its libraries.\n\nAs R users, we are blessed with the existence of CRAN and have been largely insulated from the dependency hell of frequently long and version-specific list of libraries that is the `requirements.txt` file found in most Python projects. Additionally, if you're also a Linux user like myself, you've likely fat-fingered a `venv` command and inadvertently borked your entire OS. With the torch package, you can avoid all of that and use libtorch directly from R.\n\nThe torch package provides an R interface to PyTorch via the C++ libtorch, allowing R users to take advantage of the power of PyTorch without having to touch any Python. The package is actively maintained and has a growing number of features and capabilities. It is, IMHO, the best way to get started with deep learning in R today.\n\n\n\n# diffuseR\n\nSeeing the lack of generative AI packages in R, my goal with this package is to provide diffusion models for R users. The package is built on top of the torch package and provides a simple and intuitive interface (for R users) for creating generative images from text prompts. It is designed to be easy to use and requires no prior knowledge of deep learning or PyTorch, but does require some knowledge of R. Additionally, the resource requirements are somewhat significant, so you'll want experience or at least awareness of managing your machine's RAM and VRAM when using R.\n\nThe package is still in its early stages, but it already provides a number of features and capabilities. It supports Stable Diffusion 2.1 and SDXL, and provides a simple interface for creating images from text prompts.\n\nTo get up and running quickly, I wrote the basic machinery of diffusers primarily in base R, while the heavy lifting of the pre-trained deep learning models (i.e. unet, vae, text\\_encoders) is provided by [TorchScript](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) files exported from Python. Those large TorchScript objects are hosted on our [HuggingFace page](https://huggingface.co/cornball-ai) and can be downloaded using the package. The TorchScript files are a great way to get PyTorch models into R without having to migrate the entire model and weights to R. Soon, hopefully, those TorchScript files will be replaced by standard torch objects.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nTo get started, go to the [diffuseR github page](https://github.com/cornball-ai/diffuseR) and follow the instructions there. Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache 2.\n\nThanks to Hugging Face for the original diffusers library, Stability AI for their Stable Diffusion models, to the R and torch communities for their excellent tooling and support, and also to [Claude](https://claude.ai/) and [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) for their suggestions that weren't hallucinations ;)",

    "content": "Hi everyone, I could really use your help with my master’s thesis.\n\nI’m running a moderated mediation analysis using PROCESS Model 7 in R. After checking the regression assumptions, I found:\n\t•\tHeteroskedasticity in the outcome models, and\n\t•\tNon-normal distribution of residuals.\n\nFrom what I understand, bootstrapping in PROCESS takes care of this for indirect effects. However, I’ve also read that for interpreting direct effects (X → Y), I should use HC4 robust standard errors to account for these violations.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\t1.\tIs it correct that I should run separate regression models with HC4 for interpreting direct effects?\n\t2.\tShould I use only the PROCESS output for the indirect and moderated mediation effects, since those are bootstrapped and robust?\n\nFor context: I have one IV, one mediator, one moderator, and three DVs (regret, confidence, excitement) — tested in separate models.\n\nI would really appreciate your help as my deadline is approaching and this is stressing me out 🥲",

You can then build the environment using \\`nix-build\\` and then activate the environment using \\`nix-shell\\`. It turns out that \\`ellipsenm\\` doesn’t list \\`formatR\\` as one of its dependencies, even though it requires it, so in this particular case you’d need to add \\`formatR\\` to the list of dependencies in the \\`default.nix\\` for the expression to build successfully. This is why CRAN is so important!\n\n  \nrix makes it also easy to add Python and Julia packages.\n\nFor a 5-minute video intro to rix, take a look at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4MfjKgqDOc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4MfjKgqDOc)",

My dataset includes over 30 variables, so I’ve been checking correlations and grouping similar variables to reduce multicollinearity before running regression models.\n\nThe outcome I’m studying is the number of biochar facilities in each county (a count variable). One issue I’m facing is that many counties have zero facilities, and I’ve tested and confirmed that the data is zero-inflated. Also, the data is overdispersed — the variance is much higher than the mean — which suggests that a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model would be appropriate.\n\nHowever, when I run the ZINB model, it doesn’t converge, and the standard errors are extremely large (for example, a coefficient estimate of 20 might have a standard error of 200).\n\nMy main goal is to understand which factors significantly influence the establishment of these facilities — not necessarily to create a perfect predictive model.\n\nGiven this situation, I’d like to know:\n\n1. Is there any way to improve or preprocess the data to make ZINB work?\n2. Or, is there a different method that would be more suitable for this kind of problem?",

Can I get some good recommendations where I can start from basics. I am looking for something that can help me understand better how to visualise hypothetical models, predictive models such and such.\n\nI'd really appreciate any information. You can name youtube channels, any free materials, paid courses work as well as long as they r not lengthy and expensive.",

    "content": "Heya all! I am a recent college grad and have been studying R code for several years now. I also recently learned a lot about coding with AI in python, with integrations for chat and coding environments. I am looking to create a project involving a free online R studio-type coding environment with an AI assistant. I would love some advice on what y'all would want out of this! For now my main points of interest to distinguish using this over RStudio is:  \n\\- AI context reading: the AI will know your code, data files, and console outputs without you having to copy paste line after line in, making it easier to ask simple questions and get simple responses  \n\\- Short and sweet answers: the AI will also answer your questions based on YOUR skill level and knowledge. If you only need to know how to load mtcars data, it will only tell you that! No fluff!\n\nI would love any advice on issues you all have in your daily R coding that could be solved through an AI integration in this manner. I'm really looking to distinguish from ChatGPT and other co-pilot style coding AIs out there through a more seamless integration, rather than a constant back and forth of not-so-great answers and/or problem-solving. Let me know! I'm also open to criticism!",

They use basic tests like Students and Mann-Whitney but they clearly don't know the first thing about the why and when (they got kind of mad when I told them that they've apparently been using the wrong test for several years)  \n  \nI found and completed a Coursera Specialization course by the Duke University called \"Data Analysis in R\" which definitely upped my game and allowed me to get a better understanding of the subject as well as helping me find and understand new informations...\n\nBut it's painfully obvious that I still only skimmed the surface and it bothers me a lot. When I ask questions here, people are often nice enough to explain but there's so much nuance and complexity that completely elude me\n\nIf it was possible, I would have tried to do a master degree in statistics or applied math or something to do parallel to my job but it's currently not in the realm of possibility (already doing a thesis and have toddler...)\n\nWhat would you guys suggest I could do to get better at statistics ? Is there book, online courses or thing like that I could do on my free time that would actually go deep into explaining things while remaining understandable for a novice ?\n\nThank you very much",

Relationship between the presence of indicator amphibians and the ecological status of ponds\n   * *Indicator amphibian presence/absence*: binary\n   * *Ecological status of ponds*: categorical (e.g., degraded, moderate, good)\n2. Relationship between amphibian species richness and the functional connectivity of aquatic habitats\n   * *Amphibian species richness*: continuous\n   * *Functional connectivity*: continuous\n3. Relationship between the presence of indicator amphibians and the functional connectivity of aquatic habitats\n   * *Indicator amphibian presence/absence*: binary\n   * *Functional connectivity*: continuous\n4.

The code I've implemented calculates edit distances and uses diffChr() (from diffobj) to highlight additions and deletions in a side-by-side HTML format. The goal is to visualize text changes (like deletions, additions, or modifications) between versions of posts.\n\nHere’s a brief overview of what it does:\n\n* Detects matching posts based on IDs.\n* Calculates Levenshtein and normalized distances.\n* Displays the 20 most edited posts.\n* Shows deletions with strikethrough/red background and additions in green.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hb8nqjkjycze1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acc7d5542dbbb4f03dd4ce10cbfd95248999fa68\n\nThe core logic is functional, but the visualization is not quite working as expected. Issues I’m facing:\n\n* Some of the HTML formatting doesn't render consistently inside the DataTable.\n* Additions and deletions are sometimes not aligned clearly for the reader.\n* The user experience of comparing long texts is still clunky.\n\n📌 I'm looking for help to:\n\n* Improve the visual clarity of differences (ideally more like GitHub diffs or side-by-side code comparisons).\n* Enhance alignment of differences between original and modified texts.\n* Possibly replace or supplement diffChr if better options exist in the R ecosystem. If anyone has experience with better text diffing/visualization approaches in Shiny (or even JS integration), I’d really appreciate the help or suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏  \nHappy to share more if needed!",

However, when I get to the code: res.aov &lt;- anova\\_test( data = data, dv = VALUE, wid = ID, within = c(TREATMENT, TIME) ) get\\_anova\\_table(res.aov)\n\nI get an error saying 0 non-NA cases. I checked if I have all cases and I do. When I do colSums(is.na(data)), I get 0 for all my columns.\n\nI suspect it may be related to the way my ID is set up but unsure of how to do it. I have esentially 5 treatments with 5 time points for each treatment and 5 replicates for each time point for each treatment for a total of 125 values and therefore an ID for each value. For example\n\nID : A1 Treatment : Apple Time: 0 Value: 100\n\nID: A2 Treatment: Apple Time: 0 Value: 120\n\nID: A3 Treatment: Apple Time: 10 Value: 150\n\nID: A4 Treatment: Pear Time: 0 Value: 90\n\nID: A5 Treatment: Pear Time: 0 Value: 100\n\nID: A6 Treatment: Pear Time: 10 Value: 160\n\nIf related to the way ID is set up, how could I fix it or if not I appreciate any help!",

    "title": "Understanding barriers to AI adoption in SMEs. Advice on analyzing survey data in RStudio",
    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently working on analyzing data from a survey conducted via Google Forms, which investigates the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The main goal is to understand the barriers that influence the decision to adopt AI, and to identify which categorical variables have the strongest impact on these barriers.\n\nThe survey includes:\n\n* 6 categorical variables:\n   * Industry sector\n   * Company size\n   * Revenue\n   * Location\n   * AI technologies already adopted\n   * AI technologies planned for adoption in the next 12 months\n* 11 Likert-scale questions related to barriers:\n   * Economic barriers\n   * Technological barriers\n   * Organizational and cultural barriers\n   * Legal and security barriers\n\nWhat I've Done So Far:\n\nI have already conducted some **descriptive analysis**, including:\n\n1. **Descriptive Analysis of Categorical Variables:**\n   * I’ve calculated the frequency distributions (absolute and relative) for the categorical variables (e.g., Industry, Company Size, Family Ownership) using `table()` and `prop.table()`.\n   * Visualized the distributions with bar plots using `ggplot2`, which includes frequency counts and percentage labels.\n2. **Descriptive Analysis of Likert Scale Variables:**\n   * For each of the Likert-scale questions (e.g., Economic Barriers, Technological Barriers), I’ve calculated basic descriptive statistics like the mode, mean, median, and standard deviation using `table(), mean(), median(), and sd().`\n   * I’ve also visualized the distribution of responses for each Likert-scale variable using bar plots with `ggplot2`.\n3. **Boxplot Analysis:**\n   * I’ve created **boxplots** to compare Likert-scale variables across different categories (e.g., Industry, Company Size, Revenue) to visualize how responses vary by category. This helps to assess if there are noticeable differences in barrier perceptions between different groups.\n   * Added mean labels on the boxplots using `stat_summary()` to indicate the average score for each group.\n4. **Exploring Percentages in Bar Charts:**\n   * For each Likert-scale variable, I’ve visualized the distribution of responses, including relative frequencies as percentages, to provide better insight into the distribution of responses.\n5. **Correlation Analysis (Optional):**\n   * I’ve also computed a **correlation matrix** between the Likert-scale variables using the `cor()` function, though I’m not sure if it's relevant for the next steps. This analysis shows how strongly related the different barrier variables are to each other.\n\n**Regarding the inferential analysis:**  \nI’m trying to further explore the relationships between the categorical variables and Likert scale responses to understand **which factors significantly influence the barriers to AI adoption in SMEs**. Here’s what I plan to do for the inferential part of the analysis:\n\n1. **Chi-Square Tests**: I will perform Chi-Square tests to check for associations between **categorical variables** (e.g., **industry**, **company size**, **AI adoption status**) and **Likert scale responses** (e.g., **economic barriers**, **technological barriers**).\n2. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: To compare the means of **Likert scale variables** across different categories, I’ll use ANOVA. For instance, I will test if the **importance of AI adoption** varies significantly by **industry** or **company size**. \n3. Would you suggest any other methods like: **Multinomial Logistic Regression**, **Correlation Analysis**, **Linear Regression**, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.\n\n  \nI'd appreciate any suggestions or recommendations for the analysis! Let me know if further information are required.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

Provide counts, totals, row percentages, column percentages, and cell percentages.\n2. Provide clean output in the console.\n3. Show percentages of missing values as well.\n4. Provide outputs in formats that can be readily exported to Excel.\n\nIf you know of functions that do all of these things, then please let me know.\n\nUpdate: I thought I'd settle for something that was easy, lazy, and would give me some readable output. I was finding output from CrossTable() and sjPlot's tab\\_xtab difficult to export. So here's what I did.\n\n1) I used tabyl to generate four cross tables: one for totals, one for row percentages, one for column percentages, and one for total percentages.\n\n2) I renamed columns in each percentage table with the suffix \"\\_r\\_pct\", \"\\_c\\_pct\", and \"\\_t\\_pct\".\n\n3) I did a cbind for all the tables and excluded the first column for each of the percentage tables.

    "content": "Hi all, \n\nBeginner in econometrics and in R here, I'm much more familiar with Stata but unfortunately I need to switch to R. So I'm replicating a paper. I'm using the same data than author, and I know I'm doing alright so far because the paper involves a lot of variables creation and descriptive statistics and so far I end up with exactly the same numbers, every digit is the same. \n\nBut the problem comes when I try to replicate the regression part. I'm heavily suspecting the author worked on Stata. The author mentionned the type of model she did (logit regression), the variables she used, and explained everything in the table. What I don't know tho is what command with what options exactly she ran. \n\nI'm getting completely different marginal effects and SEs than hers. I suspect this is because of the model. Could there be this much difference between Stata and R? \n\nI'm using \n\n`design &lt;- svydesign(ids = ~1, weights = ~pond, data = model_data)`\n\n`model &lt;- y ~ x`\n\n`svyglm(model, design, family = quasibinomial())`\n\n\n\nis this a perfect equivalent on the Stata command \n\n`logit y x [pweight = pond]`\n\n? If no, could you explain what options do I have to try to estimate as closely as possible the equivalent of a logistic regression in Stata please. ",

You can also view performance referenced to either inauguration day or the day before the election. \n\nThe app is built using:\n\n* [R Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) for the interactive web application.\n* [shinylive](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/) for browser-based execution without a server.\n* [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for website publishing.\n* [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) for interactive visualizations.\n\nLive app is available at [https://jhelvy.github.io/potus-econ-scorecard/](https://jhelvy.github.io/potus-econ-scorecard/)\n\nSource code is available at [https://github.com/jhelvy/potus-econ-scorecard](https://github.com/jhelvy/potus-econ-scorecard)",

    "title": "Transforming a spreadsheet so R can properly read it",
    "content": "Hi everyone, I am hoping someone can help me with this. I don't know how to succinctly phrase it so I haven't been able to find an answer through searching online. I am preparing a spreadsheet to run an ANOVA (possibly MANOVA). I am looking at how a bunch of different factors affect coral bleaching, and looking at factors such as \"Region\" (Princess Charlotte Bay, Cairns, etc), Bleached % (0%, 50%, etc), \"Species\" (Acropora, Porites, etc), Size (10cm, 20cm, 30cm, etc) and a few others factors. This is a very large dataset and as it is laid out at the moment, it is 3000 rows long. \n\nIt is currently laid out as:\n\nColumns: Region --- Bleached % --- Species --- 10cm ---20cm --- 30cm\n\nso for instance a row of data would look like:\n\nCairns --- 50% --- Acropora --- 2 --- 1 --- 4\n\nwith the 2, 1, and 4 corresponding to how many of each size class there are, so for instance there are 2 10cm Acroporas that are 50% bleached at Cairns, 1 that is 20cm and 50% bleached, and 4 that are 30cm and 50% bleached. Ideally I would have the spreadsheet laid out so each row represented one coral, so this above example would transform into 7 rows that would read:\n\nCairns --- 50% --- Acropora --- 10cm\n\nCairns --- 50% --- Acropora --- 10cm\n\nCairns --- 50% --- Acropora --- 20cm\n\nCairns --- 50% --- Acropora --- 30cm\n\nCairns --- 50% --- Acropora --- 30cm\n\nCairns --- 50% --- Acropora --- 30cm\n\nCairns --- 50% --- Acropora --- 30cm\n\nbut with my dataset being so large, it would take ages to do this manually. Does anyone know if there is a trick to getting excel to transform the spreadsheet in this way? Or if R would accept and properly read a dataset that it set up as I currently have it? Thanks very much for your help!  \n",

I thought I had the correct analysis (a two way mixed effects ANOVA), which (with a post hoc test) gave me two nice table outputs showing me the significance between treatments at each timepoint and within treatment type across timepoints. However, I've just realised that a two way mixed effects ANOVA might not work because my data is count data and more importantly I need to account for the fact that some of the plants are in the same pond and some are not (eg accounting for pseudoreplication). I then thought that a glmer may be the most suitable but I can't seem to get a good post hoc test to give me the same output as previously. Any suggestions on which test or even where I should be looking for extra info would be greatly appreciated! TIA",

Go easy on me, this is my first machine learning/predictive model project and I had very basic python experience before this.\n\n\nI’ve been working on a personal project building a model that predicts NFL player performance using full career, game-by-game data for any offensive player who logged a snap between 2017–2024. \n\nI trained the model using data through 2023 with XGBoost Regressor, and then used actual 2024 matchups — including player demographics (age, team, position, depth chart) and opponent defensive stats (Pass YPG, Rush YPG, Points Allowed, etc.) — as inputs to predict game-level performance in 2024.\n\nThe model performs really well for some stats (e.g., R² &gt; 0.875 for Completions, Pass Attempts, CMP%, Pass Yards, and Passer Rating), but others — like Touchdowns, Fumbles, or Yards per Target — aren’t as strong.\n\nHere’s where I need input:\n\n-What’s a solid baseline R², RMSE, and MAE to aim for — and does that benchmark shift depending on the industry?\n\n-Could trying other models/a combination of models improve the weaker stats? Should I use different models for different stat categories (e.g., XGBoost for high-R² ones, something else for low-R²)?\n\n-How do you typically decide which model is the best fit? Trial and error? Is there a structured way to choose based on the stat being predicted?\n\n-I used XGBRegressor based on common recommendations — are there variants of XGBoost or alternatives you'd suggest trying? Any others you like better?\n\n-Are these considered “good” model results for sports data?\n\n-Are sports models generally harder to predict than industries like retail, finance, or real estate?\n\n-What should my next step be if I want to make this model more complete and reliable (more accurate) across all stat types?\n\n-How do people generally feel about manually adding in more intangible stats to tweak data and model performance? Example: Adding an injury index/strength multiplier for a Defense that has a lot of injuries, or more player’s coming back from injury, etc.? Is this a generally accepted method or not really utilized?\n\nAny advice, criticism, resources, or just general direction is welcomed.",

Box plotting the data shows that the 25p for one of the groups is quite a bit lower. \n\nI have two questions: \n\n1) Does this boxplot indicate that the assumption of equal variance is not fulfilled?

When I have run PCA in the past, the columns have been species abundance and the rows have represented different sampling sites. This one is a bit different and I am not sure how to approach it. Is it correct to run one (technically 2, one for hatchery and one for strain) with environmental and performance variables together in the dataset? Or is it better if I split out environmental and performance variables and run a PCA for each? How would you go about analyzing a multivariate dataset like this?\n\n  \nWith just the environmental data with \"hatcheries\" I get something that looks like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h4rm5nbsr9se1.png?width=1269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48cdcb5754f7ca828251857908575b70f68bccc7\n\n",

    "content": "I am a neuropsychology student working on my master thesis project on early symptoms in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). For this, I have collected free text data from patient dossiers of FTD patients, Alzheimer's patients and a control group. I have coded this free text data into (1) broader symptom categories (e.g. behavioural symptoms) and (2) more narrow subcategories (e.g. loss of empathy, loss of inhibition, apathy etc.) using ATLAS.ti. \n\nI am looking for tips/ideas for a good quantitative statistical analysis pipeline with the following goals in mind (A) identifying which symptom categories are present in a single patient and (B) identifying the severity of a symptom categorie based on the number of subcategories that are present in a patient and (C) finally comparing the three groups (FTD, AD and control).\n\nThanks in advance for your help! :)",

    "content": "**UPDATE:** I have figured out the issue! Everything was correct...  As this is a non-parametric test (as my data did not meet assumptions), the test is done on the ranks rather than the data itself.  Friedman's is similar to a repeated measures anova.  My groups had no overlap, meaning all samples in group \"youngVF\" were smaller than their counterparts in group \"youngF\", etc.  So, the rankings were exactly the same for every sample.  Therefore, the test statistic was also the same for each pairwise comparison, and hence the p-values.  To test this, I manually changed three data points to make the rankings be altered for three samples, and my results reflected those changes.  \n\n\n\nI am running a Friedman's test (similar to repeated measures ANOVA) followed by post-hoc pair-wise analysis using Wilcox.  The code works fine, but I am concerned about the results.  (In case you are interested, I am comparing C-scores (co-occurrence patterns) across scales for many communities.)\n\nHere is the code:\n\n`friedman.test(y=scaleY$Cscore, groups=scaleY$Matrix, blocks=scaleY$Genome)`\n\nHere are the results:\n\n`data: scaleM$Cscore, scaleM$Matrix and scaleM$Genome`\n\n`Friedman chi-squared = 189, df = 3, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16`\n\nFollowed by the Wilcox test:\n\n`wilcox_test(Cscore~Matrix, data=scaleY, paired=T, p.adjust.method=\"bonferroni\")`\n\nHere are the results:\n\n`# A tibble: 6 × 9`\n\n`.y. group1 group2 n1 n2 statistic p p.adj p.adj.signif`\n\n`* &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;`\n\n`1 Cscore young_VF young_F 63 63 2016 5.29e-12 3.17e-11 ****`\n\n`2 Cscore young_VF young_M 63 63 2016 5.29e-12 3.17e-11 ****`\n\n`3 Cscore young_VF young_C 63 63 2016 5.29e-12 3.17e-11 ****`\n\n`4 Cscore young_F young_M 63 63 2016 5.29e-12 3.17e-11 ****`\n\n`5 Cscore young_F young_C 63 63 2016 5.29e-12 3.17e-11 ****`\n\n`6 Cscore young_M young_C 63 63 2016 5.29e-12 3.17e-11 ****`\n\nI am aware of the fact that R does not report p-values smaller than 2.2e-16.  My concern is that the Wilcox results are all exactly the same.  Is this a similar issue that R does not report p-values smaller than 2.2e-16?  Can I get more specific results?",

    "title": "Finding correlation between Count Data and categorical variables",
    "content": "Greetings, I've been doing some statistics for my thesis, so I'm not a Pro and the solution shouldn't be  too complicated.\n\nI've got a dataset with several Count Data (Counts of individuals of several groups) as target variables. There's different predictors (continuous, binary, categorical (ordinal and nominal)). I wanna find out which predictors have an effect on my Count Data.  I don't wanna do a multivariate analysis. For some of the count data I fitted mixed models with a Random effect and the distribution seems normal. But some models I can't get to be normally distributed (I tried log and sqrt-transformation). I also have a lot of correlation going on between some of my predictor variables (but I'm not sure if I tested it correctly). \n\nSo my first question is: How do you deal with correlation between predictors in a linear mixed model?Do you just don't fit them together in one model or is there another way?\n\nMy second question is: What do I do with the models that don't follow a normal distribution? Am I just going to test for correlation (e.g. spearman, Kendall) for each predictor and the target variables without fitting models?\n\nThe third question is (and Ive seen a lot of posts about this topic): Which test is suitable for testing the correlation between a nominal variable with 3 or more levels and a continuous variable, if the target data isn't normally distributed?\n\nI've found answers that say I can use spearmans rho, if I just turn my predictor to as.numeric. Some say that's only possible with dichotomous variables. I also used X² and Fishers-Test between predictor variables that were both nominal, and between variables where one was continuous and one was nominal. \n\nAs you can see I'm quite confused because of the different answers I found... Maybe someone can help  to get my thoughts organized :) Thanks in advance!",

    "content": "Currently at work I have a powerful linux box (40 cores, 1T ram), my typical workflow involve ingesting big'ish data sets (csv, binary files) into R through fread/custom binary file reader into data.table in an R interactive session (mostly command line, occasionally I use Rstudio free version). The session will remains open for days/weeks while I work on the data set, running data transformation, data exploration code, generating reports, summary stats, linear fitting, making ggplot on condensed version of the data, running some custom RCpp code on the data etc etc…, just basically pretty general data science exploration/research work… The memory footprint of the R process will be hundreds of Gb (data.tables sized at a few hundreds millions rows), grow and shrink as I spawn multi-threaded processing on the dataset.  \n  \nI have been thinking about possibility of moving this kind of workflow onto aws cloud (company already using Aws) - what would some possible setups looks like? What would you use for data storage (currently csv, columnized binary data, on local disk of the box, but open to switch to other storage format if it makes sense...), how would you run an interactive R session for ingesting the data and running ad-hoc / interactive analysis on cloud? The cost of renting/leasing a high spec box 24x7x365 will actually be more expensive than owning a high-end physical box? Or there are smart ways to breakdown the dataset / compute so that I don’t need such a high spec box yet I can still run ad-hoc analysis on that size of data interactively pretty easily?",

I generally don't use random forest because it is prone to overfitting, but I don't have a choice due to some other constraints in the data.\n\nI am using the package `randomForest`. It is for a species distribution model (presence/pseudoabsence response) and I am using regression rather than classification.\n\nI use the function `expand.grid()` to create a dataframe with all the combinations of settings for the function's parameters, including `sampsize`, `nodesize`, `maxnodes`, `ntree`, and `mtry`.\n\nWithin each run, I am doing a four-fold crossvalidation and recording the mean and standard deviation of the AUC for training and test data, the mean r-squared, and the mean of squared residuals.\n\n**Any idea on how can I use these statistics to select the parameters for a model that is both generalizable and fairly good at prediction?** My first thought was looking at parameters that had a difference between mean train AUC and mean test AUC, but I'm not sure if that is the best place to start or what.\n\n  \nThanks!",
