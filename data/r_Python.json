    "content": "Every time I've talked about Python 3.14's new t-strings online, many folks have been confused about how t-strings are different from f-strings, why t-strings are useful, and whether t-strings are a replacement for f-strings.\n\n  \nI published [a short article (and video) on Python 3.14's new t-strings](https://pym.dev/t-strings-in-python/) that's meant to explain this.\n\nThe TL;DR:\n\n* Python has had 4 string formatting approaches before t-strings\n* T-strings are different because they *don't actually return strings*\n* T-strings are useful for library authors who need the disassembled parts of a string interpolation for the purpose of pre-processing interpolations\n* T-strings definitely do not replace f-strings: keep using f-strings until specific libraries tell you to use a t-string with one or more of their utilities\n\nWatch the video or read the article for a short demo and a library that uses them as well.\n\nIf you've been confusing about t-strings, I hope this explanation helps.",

    "content": "I recently released Python Pest, a port of the Rust pest parsing library.\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nPython Pest is a declarative PEG parser generator for Python, ported from Rust's Pest. You write grammars instead of hand-coding parsing logic, and it builds parse trees automatically.\n\nDefine a grammar using Pest version 2 syntax, like this:\n\n    jsonpath        = _{ SOI ~ jsonpath_query ~ EOI }\n    jsonpath_query  = _{ root_identifier ~ segments }\n    segments        = _{ (S ~ segment)* }\n    root_identifier = _{ \"$\" }\n    \n    segment = _{\n      | child_segment\n      | descendant_segment\n    }\n    \n    // snip\n\nAnd traverse parse trees using [structural pattern matching](https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/), like this:\n\n    def parse_segment(self, segment: Pair) -&gt; Segment:\n        match segment:\n            case Pair(Rule.CHILD_SEGMENT, [inner]):\n                return ChildSegment(segment, self.parse_segment_inner(inner))\n            case Pair(Rule.DESCENDANT_SEGMENT, [inner]):\n                return RecursiveDescentSegment(segment, self.parse_segment_inner(inner))\n            case Pair(Rule.NAME_SEGMENT, [inner]) | Pair(Rule.INDEX_SEGMENT, [inner]):\n                return ChildSegment(segment, [self.parse_selector(inner)])\n            case _:\n                raise JSONPathSyntaxError(\"expected a segment\", segment)\n\nSee [docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-pest/), [GitHub](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-pest) and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/python-pest/) for a complete example.\n\n# Target Audience\n\n* Python developers who need to parse custom languages, data formats, or DSLs.\n* Anyone interested in grammar-first design over hand-coded parsers.\n* Developers curious about leveraging Python's match/case for tree-walking.\n\n# Comparison\n\nParsimonious is another general purpose, pure Python parser package that reads parsing expression grammars. Python Pest differs in grammar syntax and subsequent tree traversal technique, preferring external iteration of parse trees instead of defining a visitor.\n\n# Feedback\n\nI'd appreciate any feedback, especially your thoughts on the trade-off between declarative grammars and performance in Python. Does the clarity and maintainability make up for slower execution compared to hand-tuned parsers?\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/jg-rp/python-pest](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-pest)",

    "title": "I built a Persistent KV Store in Pure Python",
    "content": "Hi everyone!\n\n I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. \n\n\n\n# Core Architecture:\n\nThe engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.\n\nSome features that I'm proud of:\n\n* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.\n* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.\n* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.\n* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.\n* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.\n\nMy favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.\n\n# Get Started\n\n    pip install lsm_storage_engine_key_value_store\n\n**Usage via CLI/Server:**\n\n1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`\n2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).\n\n# Looking for Feedback\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts about this implementation and how I can make it better and what features I can add in later versions. Ideas and constructive criticism are always welcome. I'm also looking for contributors, if anyone is interested, please feel free to PM and we can discuss.\n\nRepo link: [Shashank1985/storage-engine](https://github.com/Shashank1985/storage-engine)  \nThanks!!",

Repo: [https://github.com/Bowser04/Assembly-to-Minecraft-Command-Block-Compiler](https://github.com/Bowser04/Assembly-to-Minecraft-Command-Block-Compiler)\n\nWhat My Project Does:\n\n* Parses a tiny assembly-style language (labels, arithmetic, branches, simple I/O) and emits Minecraft command sequences tailored for command blocks.\n* Produces low-level, inspectable output so you can see how program logic maps to in-game command-block logic.\n* Implemented in Python for readability and easy contribution.\n\nTarget Audience:\n\n* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.\n* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.\n* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.\n* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments — not a production compiler for large-scale programs.\n\nComparison (how it differs from alternatives):\n\n* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language→Minecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.\n* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.\n* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).\n\nHow to help:\n\n* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.\n* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.\n* Contribute: PRs welcome for bug fixes, examples, optimizations, docs, or tests — look for good-first-issue.",

    "content": "`calc-workbook` is an easy-to-use Python library that lets you access *computed Excel values* directly from Python. It loads Excel files, evaluates all formulas using the `formulas` engine, and provides a clean, minimal API to read the computed results from each sheet — no Excel installation required.\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nThis project solves a common frustration when working with Excel files in Python: most libraries can read or write workbooks, but they can’t compute formulas. `calc-workbook` bridges that gap. You load an Excel file, it computes all the formulas using the `formulas` package, and you can instantly access the computed cell values — just like Excel would show them. Everything runs natively in Python, making it platform-independent and ideal for Linux users who want full Excel compatibility without Excel itself.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nFor Python developers, data analysts, or automation engineers who work with Excel files and want to access real formula results (not just static values) without relying on Excel or heavy dependencies.\n\n# Comparison\n\n* **openpyxl** and **pandas** can read and write Excel files but do not calculate formulas.\n* **xlwings** requires Excel to compute formulas and is Windows/macOS only.\n* **calc-workbook** computes formulas natively in Python using the `formulas` engine and gives you the results in one simple call.\n\n# Installation\n\n    pip install calc-workbook\n\n# Example\n\n    from calc_workbook import CalcWorkbook\n    \n    wb = CalcWorkbook.load(\"example.xlsx\")\n    print(wb.get_sheet_names())           # ['sheet1']\n    \n    sheet = wb.get_sheet(\"sheet1\")        # or get_sheet() to get the first sheet\n    print(\"A1:\", sheet.cell(\"A1\"))        # 10\n    print(\"A2:\", sheet.cell(\"A2\"))        # 20\n    print(\"A3:\", sheet.cell(\"A3\"))        # 200\n\n# Example Excel file:\n\n|**A**|**B**|\n|:-|:-|\n|**1**|10|\n|**2**|20|\n|**3**|`=A1+A2`|\n\n# GitHub\n\n[https://github.com/a-bentofreire/calc-workbook](https://github.com/a-bentofreire/calc-workbook)",

    "content": "Hi all!\n\n\nNearly a year ago (apparently, just a day shy of a whole year!), I shared the first iteration of my Python library with you all; now, a year later, I'm hoping to bring you an improved version of it. :)\n\n\n# What Does It Do\n\n\n**temporals** aims to provide a minimalistic utility layer on top of the Python standard library's `datetime` package in regards to working with `time`, `date` and `datetime` periods.\n\n\nThe library offers four different flavours of periods:\n\n* `TimePeriod`\n* `DatePeriod`\n* `WallClockPeriod`\n* `AbsolutePeriod`\n\n\nThe separation between a wall clock and an absolute period replaces the original DatetimePeriod with more concrete types as well as support for DST time changes and/or leap years. \n\n\nThis iteration also comes with more interfaces which should allow you to further extend the library to match your own needs, in case the current implementations aren't satisfactory.\n\n\n# Examples, Documentation, Links\n\n\nMy original post contains a bit more information on available methods as well as comparison to other libraries, I wanted to save you from being blasted with a wall of text, but if you're curious, feel free to have a look here - https://old.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1g8nu9s/temporals_a_time_date_and_datetime_periods_support/\n\n\nIn-depth documentation and examples is available on the Wiki page in Github - https://github.com/dimitarOnGithub/temporals/wiki\n\n\nPyPi page - https://pypi.org/project/temporals/\n\n\nSource Code - https://github.com/dimitarOnGithub/temporals\n\n\n\n# Notes\n\n\n* Any feedback and criticism is always more than welcome and will be greatly appreciated!

    "title": "NamedTuples are a PITA",
    "content": "I've also created a thread for this on Python forum - [see here](https://discuss.python.org/t/allow-to-pass-defaults-when-defining-namedtuple-dynamically/104484).\n\nTL;DR - When defining NamedTuples dynamically, there should be a single interface that'd allow to pass all 3 - field names, annotations, and defaults.\n\nI needed to convert to convert normal Python classes into NamedTuples. (see final implementation [here](https://github.com/django-components/django-components/pull/1466#discussion_r2447261223))\n\n❌ For normal classes, you could simply make a new class that subclasses from both.\n\n    class X(MyClass, NamedTuple):\n        pass\n\nBut NamedTuples don't support that.\n\n❌ And you can't further subclass the subclass of `NamedTuples`:\n\n    class Another(NamedTuple):\n        x: int = 1\n    \n    class X(Another):\n        y: str\n\n❌ When using `typing.NamedTuple` as a function, you can't pass in defaults:\n\n    my_class = typing.NamedTuple(\"MyClass\", [(\"x\", int), (\"y\", str)])\n\nI tried setting the defaults ([`_field_defaults`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.somenamedtuple._field_defaults)) manually, but Python wasn't picking that up.\n\n❌ One option was to define the NamedTuple with a class syntax as a string, and then evaluate that string. But that had 2 problems - 1) security risk, and 2) we'd need to import all the types used in annotations:\n\n    my_cls_str = \"\"\"\n    from typing import NamedTuple\n    \n    from path.to.custom import CustomClass\n    \n    class MyClass(NamedTuple):\n        x: int\n        y: str\n        z: CustomClass\n    \"\"\"\n    my_cls = eval(my_cls_str, {}, {})\n\n✅ Lastly I managed to get it working using `collections.namedtuple`. This function doesn't define the field annotations, but it is able to handle defaults. Just one annoying thing was how it sets defaults the same way as Python functions do - it assigns the defaults from the back of the function signature.\n\nSo if I have NamedTuple with 3 fields - `x`, `y`, and `z`, and I set defaults to `[\"hello\", 123]`:\n\n    my_cls = namedtuple(\"MyClass\", [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"], defaults=[\"hello\", 123])\n\nthen this is the same as writing:\n\n    class MyClass(NamedTuple):\n        x: int\n        y: str = \"hello\"\n        z: int = 123\n\nOne caveat is that `collections.namedtuple()` doesn't set the annotations, so I had also set `__annotations__` at the end.\n\nOne thing I didn't know - when defining `NamedTuple`, the fields it recognizes are only those that are annotated. If a field is NOT annotated, it's treated as a CLASS VARIABLE:\n\n    class MyClass(NamedTuple):\n        x: int            # Required field\n        y: str = \"hello\"  # Optional field (with default)\n        z = 123           # Class var!\n\nSo at the end I also assigned the class variables to the new namedtuple class.\n\nSurprisingly LLMs were really bad at solving this, so I'm hoping this comment gets into the next training set.",

    "title": "[Fun project] UV scripts, but for functions.",
    "content": "**What My Project Does**\n\nI recently created [**uv-func**](https://github.com/Roulbac/uv-func), a small tool that brings the dependency-isolation concept of tools like *uv scripts* down to the level of individual Python functions. Instead of managing dependencies per module or script, uv-func lets you run discrete functions in a contained environment so they can run, communicate with each other, and manage their dependencies cleanly and separately.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\n* Python developers working with scripts or functions that need to be isolated or decoupled in terms of dependencies.\n* Hobbyists or maintainers who appreciate minimal tooling (uv-func has only three dependencies: cloudpickle, portalocker and rich).\n\nNote: This isn’t a full framework for large applications — it’s intended to be lightweight and easy to embed or integrate as needed.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nThere are other tools that handle dependency isolation or function-level execution (for example, using containers, virtual environments per script, or Function-as-a-Service frameworks like Ray, etc...). \n\nWhat sets uv-func apart in my opinion:\n\n1. Minimal footprint: only three external dependencies.\n2. Focused on the function-level rather than full modules or services.\n3. Lightweight and easy to drop into existing Python codebases without heavy platform or infrastructure requirements.\n\nI see many AWS lambdas using requirements.txt then needing to run \\`pip install\\` somewhere in their app or infra code, and one example that comes immediately to mind is to use \\`uv-func\\` instead of \\`requirements.txt\\` for something like that (or even just uv scripts if function-level granularity isn't needed).\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts, thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "gs-batch-pdf v0.6.0: Parallel PDF processing with Ghostscript",
    "content": "As a structural engineer I have to deal with lots of pdfs and Public Administration strict, sometimes ridiculous, size requirements. I don't like to use online tools, but instead I prefer a nifty cli like Ghostscript (`gs`). The only problem is that `gs` syntax could be quite criptic sometimes, and I always need to search online for it because I would forget it. So I built a wrapper for it.\n\n# What My Project Does\n\ngs-batch-pdf is a CLI tool that batch-processes multiple PDF files simultaneously using Ghostscript. It handles compression (5 quality levels), PDF/A conversion (PDF/A-1/2/3), and custom Ghostscript operations with multi-threaded execution. Features include automatic file size comparison (keeps smaller file by default), recursive directory processing, flexible output naming with prefixes/suffixes, and configurable error handling modes (prompt/skip/abort).\n\nInstallation: `pipx install gs-batch-pdf`\n\nQuick example:\n\n    # Compress all PDFs in docs/ recursively, attach prefix to output\n    gsb ./docs/ -r --compress --prefix compressed_\n    \n    # Compress + convert to PDF/A inplace\n    gsb *.pdf --compress --pdfa --force\n\n# Target Audience\n\nFor users who regularly process multiple PDFs (archiving, compliance, file size reduction). Requires Ghostscript installed as a system dependency. Tested on Windows, Linux with Python 3.12+ (macOS user, tell me). Particularly useful for:\n\n* Batch compress multiple files\n* Batch conversion to PDF/A standard (2 recommended)\n* Automated document processing pipelines\n\n# Comparison\n\nUnlike running Ghostscript directly (which processes one file at a time), **gs-batch-pdf adds parallel execution**, progress tracking, and smart file management. Compared to Python PDF libraries (pypdf, PyPDF2), this leverages Ghostscript's robust compression/conversion capabilities rather than pure-Python implementations. Unlike pdftk (focused on splitting/merging), this specializes in compression and standards compliance.\n\n**Unlike online tools, all processing happens locally with no privacy concerns.**\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/kompre/gs-batch](https://github.com/kompre/gs-batch)\n\nPyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/gs-batch-pdf/](https://pypi.org/project/gs-batch-pdf/)",

Every time, I had to open heavy editors like Miro or Figma, which felt like overkill.\n\nSo, I decided to build a tool that lives right inside the app I use for communication all day: Telegram.\n\nI'm excited to share my side project: **Diagrammer Bot**. It's a simple yet powerful bot in Python that lets you create diagrams on the fly.\n\n**Here are the key features:**\n*   **Text &amp; Image Nodes:** You can create blocks not just from text, but from any image you send.\n*   **Full Editing:** Create, connect, edit, and delete both nodes and edges.\n*   **Project System:** Save your diagrams with custom names, load them later, or start new ones.\n*   **Themes &amp; Export:** Switch between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode. Export your final diagram as a high-quality PNG.\n*   **Open-Source:** The entire project is available on GitHub!\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python, `python-telegram-bot`, `Graphviz` for rendering, and `Pillow` for watermarking.\n\nI would be incredibly grateful for any feedback, feature ideas, or bug reports. And of course, a star ⭐ on GitHub would make my day!\n\n*   **Try the bot here:** [https://t.me/diagrammer_robot](https://t.me/diagrammer_robot)\n*   **Check out the code on GitHub:** [https://github.com/Lixher/Diagrammer-bot](https://github.com/Lixher/Diagrammer-Bot)",

I do this to respect Discord rate limits. It only counts as one message. I also use neon as the human eye has a neon reaction biologically similar to a phosphor glow. The colors persist longer with higher saturation on the human retina, and we interpolate to smooth the motion. \n\nI'm new to Python, but I absolutely love it. I designed an animated Discord bot that has Pokémon/Fallout style creatures. I was thinking of adding battling, but for now it is more an interactive guide. \n\nI used accurate visual width calculations to get the text art wrapping correct. Rendered and then scaled so it fits any device. And then vectorized the rendering. Visual width is expensive, but it lines up in nice columns allowing vectorized rendering. \n\nI wanted to see what you all thought, so here is the repo! It has everything you should need to get your own terminal animations going. It includes my visual width file, my scaling file, and also an example animation of my logo that demonstrates how to use the width calculations. That is the trickiest part. Once you have that down you're solid. \n\nhttps://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/PNGN-Terminal-Animator\n\nNote: I included the custom emojis for the renderer. They work fairly well but not perfectly quite yet. The double cell size is hard to handle with visual width calculations. I will be working on it!\n\nPlease take a look and give me feedback! I will attach animated GIFs to the repo that are outputted from my bot! There is an example logo renderer too to get you started. \n\nThank you!",

    "content": "I'm new-ish to python but come from a systems and embedded programming background and want to use python and pytest to automate testing with IoT devices through BLE, serial or other transports in the future. I started prototyping with Trio as that was the library I saw being used in a reference pytest plugin, I checked out Trio and was very pleased on the emphasis of the concept of structured concurrency  (Swift has this concept with the same name in-grained so I knew what it meant and love it) and started writing a prototype to get something working. \n\nIt was quick for me to notice the lack of  IO library that support Trio natively and this was bummer at first but no big deal as I could manage to find a small wrapper library for serial communication with Trio and wrote my own. However now that I'm having to prototype the BLE side of things I've found zero library, examples or material that uses Trio. Bleak which is the prime library I see pop-up when I look for BLE and python is written with the asyncio backend. I haven't done a lot of research into asyncio or anyio but now I'm thinking if I should switch to one of these (preferably anyio as it's the middle ground) and have to refactor while it is still early.\n\nSo wanted to ask if I would be losing  much by not going with Trio instead of one of the other libraries? I would hate to lose Tasks and TaskGroups (Nurseries in Trio) as well as Channels and Events but I think Anyio has them too although the implementation might be different. I also like Trio's support for sockets, subprocess and other low level APIs out of the box. Would appreciate any feedback on your experience using Trio or the other async libraries for similar use cases as mine. ",

    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm starting a new open-source project aimed at developing a fully functional **Passive SDR Radar (PCL)** system using the **KrakenSDR** platform. The primary goal is to effectively detect and track **dynamic aerial targets** (like drones and aircraft) by processing existing broadcast signals, specifically **DVB-T2**, in the 514 MHz range .\n\nWe are currently in the architecture and initial development phase, and I welcome any feedback, expertise, and collaboration from the KrakenSDR community, especially regarding signal processing and phase calibration.\n\n\n\n# Project Overview &amp; Goals\n\n\n\nThis system operates entirely passively, making it robust against electronic countermeasures (ECM).\n\n* **Hardware:** KrakenSDR (5 channels), 5 x Yagi-Uda Antennas (1 Reference + 4 Surveillance for a phased array setup), Raspberry Pi 5.\n* **Illuminator:** DVB-T2 broadcast signals (around **514 MHz**).\n* **Target:** Drones, aircraft, and missiles.\n\n\n\n# Core Processing Pipeline\n\n\n\nThe project focuses heavily on signal processing to separate moving targets from static ground reflections (clutter). Our pipeline involves these key steps:\n\n1. **IQ Data Acquisition:** Capture raw data from the 5 KrakenSDR channels.\n2. **Calibration:** Synchronization and phase calibration (a critical challenge with non-coherent sources).\n3. **CAF Calculation:** Generate the **Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF)**, which creates a `delay × doppler` map (our radar frame).\n4. **Clutter Suppression:** Apply **MTI (Moving Target Indication)** or FIR High-Pass filters along the time axis to suppress stationary echoes (zero-Doppler).\n5. **Detection:** Use 2D **CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate)** to extract targets from the filtered CAF maps.\n6. **Tracking:** Implement a **Kalman Filter** combined with the **Hungarian Algorithm** for robust data association and continuous tracking of targets (creating unique IDs and time series data).\n\n\n\n# Current Focus &amp; Challenges\n\n\n\nWe are seeking advice and discussion on the following technical points:\n\n1. **Phase Synchronization:** Best practices for achieving precise phase synchronization between the four surveillance channels on the KrakenSDR using an external clock or through software compensation, especially for non-coherent DVB-T2 signals.\n2. **CAF Optimization:** Techniques to optimize the computation time of the CAF on resource-limited devices like the Raspberry Pi 5.\n3. **MTI/Clutter Filtering:** Experience with adaptive clutter suppression algorithms (beyond simple MTI) for PCL systems utilizing OFDM signals like DVB-T2.\n\n\n\n# Repository and Collaboration\n\n\n\nThe project structure is available on GitHub. We are organizing the code into logical folders (`src/`, `config/`, `systemd/`) and are documenting the technical specifications in the `docs/` folder.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** [`https://github.com/Stanislav-sipiko/passive-sdr-radar`](https://github.com/Stanislav-sipiko/passive-sdr-radar)\n\nFeel free to check out the repo, submit issues, or share your knowledge here!\n\nThanks in advance for your input!",

    "content": "Hey,\n\nI'd like to share a project I built to streamline a common task in my workflow. I've structured this post to follow the showcase rules.\n\n**What My Project Does:**\n\n**PydSQL** is a lightweight,  no dependencies besides Pydantic utility that converts Pydantic models directly into SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements.\n\nThe goal is to eliminate the manual, error-prone process of keeping SQL schemas synchronized with your Python data models.\n\nFor example, you write this Pydantic model:\n\nPython\n\n    from pydantic import BaseModel\n    from datetime import date\n    \n    class Product(BaseModel):\n        product_id: int\n        name: str\n        price: float\n        launch_date: date\n        is_available: bool\n\nAnd PydSQL instantly generates the corresponding SQL:\n\nSQL\n\n    CREATE TABLE product (\n        product_id INTEGER,\n        name TEXT,\n        price REAL,\n        launch_date DATE,\n        is_available BOOLEAN\n    );\n\nIt does one thing and aims to do it well, without adding the complexity of a full database toolkit.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThe target audience is **Python developers who prefer writing raw SQL or use lightweight database libraries** (like `sqlite3`, `psycopg2`, etc.) instead of a full ORM.\n\nIt's intended for small to medium-sized projects where a tool like SQLAlchemy or Django's ORM might feel like overkill, but you still want the benefit of automated schema generation from a single source of truth (your Pydantic model). It is meant for practical development workflows, not just as a toy project.\n\n**Comparison**\n\n* **vs. Manual SQL:** PydSQL is a direct replacement for manually writing and updating `.sql` files. It reduces boilerplate, prevents typos, and ensures your database schema never drifts from your application's data models.\n* **vs. ORMs (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM):** PydSQL is **not an ORM**. It doesn't handle database connections, sessions, or query building. This makes it far more lightweight and simpler. It's for developers who want to write their own SQL queries but just want to automate the table creation part.\n* **vs. SQLModel:** While SQLModel also uses Pydantic, it is a full ORM built on top of SQLAlchemy. PydSQL is different because it has no opinion on how you interact with your database it only generates the `CREATE` statement.\n\n**Links**\n\n* **Source Code (GitHub):**[https://github.com/pranavkp71/PydSQL](https://github.com/pranavkp71/PydSQL)\n* **PyPI:** `pip install pydsql`\n\nThe project is very new, and I'm actively looking for feedback, feature requests, and contributors.

    "title": "If starting from scratch, what would you change in Python. And bringing back an old discussion.",
    "content": " I know that it's a old discussion on the community, the trade of between simplicity and \"magic\" was a great topic about 10 years ago. Recently I was making a Flask project, using some extensions, and I stop to think about the usage pattern of this library. Like you can create your app in some function scope, and use current\\_app to retrieve it when inside a app context, like a route. But extensions like socketio you most likely will create a \"global\" instance, pass the app as parameter, so you can import and use it's decorators etc. I get why in practice you will most likely follow.\n\n  \n What got me thinking was the decisions behind the design to making it this way. Like, flask app you handle in one way, extensions in other, you can create and register multiples apps in the same instance of the extension, one can be retrieved with the proxy like current\\_app, other don't (again I understand that one will be used only in app context and the other at function definition time). Maybe something like you accessing the instances of the extensions directly from app object, and making something like route declaration, o things that depends on the instance of the extension being declared at runtime, inside some app context. Maybe this will actually make things more complex? Maybe.\n\n I'm not saying that is wrong, or that my solution is better, or even that I have a good/working solution, I'm just have a strange fell about it. Mainly after I started programming in low level lang like C++ and Go, that has more strict rules, that makes things more complex to implement, but more coherent. But I know too that a lot of things in programming goes as it was implemented initially and for the sake of just make things works you keep then as it is and go along, or you just follow the conventions to make things easier (e.g. banks system still being in Cobol).\n\n  \n Don't get me wrong, I love this language and it's still my most used one, but in this specific case it bothers me a little, about the abstraction level (I know, I know, it's a Python programmer talking about abstraction, only a Js could me more hypocritical). And as I said before, I know it's a old question that was exhausted years ago. So my question for you guys is, to what point is worth trading convenience with abstraction? And if we would start everything from scratch, what would you change in Python or in some specific library?",

Configuration options include certain things for x- and y-thresholds on joining data in lines, etc. Using Regular Expressions to pull structured data from different parts of the document. Documents are PDFs and PNGs of structured, form-based documents.\n\nI built a config for a new client yesterday that worked picture perfect, basically first time and for a number of documents I ran as a test suite. Very little tweaking and special configs. It was straight forward and was probably the first time this system didn't feel overtaxed. (don't get me started on the overall design of it)\n\nCoworker ran the same setup, and it failed. Built on the same version of Python, all from the same requirements list, etc. Literally the only difference is I'm running on MacOS and he's running Windows 11. Same code base, pulled from same repository. Same config file. Same same all around. \n\nHe had to adjust one setting to get it to work at all, and I'm still not sure the whole thing worked as expected. Mine did, repeatedly, on multiple documents. \n\n  \nAs this will eventually be running on a container in some silly google environment which is probably running some version of \\*nix OS, I'd say my Mac is closer to the \"real deal\" than his windows machine; gun to my head, I'm saying if it works on mine and not on his, his is the bigger problem. \n\nAnyone aware of such differences on disparate platforms?",

    "content": "Hey guys A bit of a background - I have a bachelors in CS (just finished) and quite a bit of \"experience\" - since I started working basically full time after my sophomore year of uni at an AI startup based in SF. Since then I have graduated, switched jobs to a different startup in SF that values me more. I also do some part time research in AI, have a research paper - and a couple more on the way - beside my day job. However the problem is - I dont think in the past 1-2 years or so - I haven't really made my skills more robust. So here I am looking for resources on how to learn some of the more intermediate concepts in Python specifically - as that is the language that I use the most often. A bit of background of my familiarity with programming - have done a decent bit of C - in undergrad - dealt with some networking and OS-level code in C (sockets, raw sockets, implementing file transfer protocols from RFCs etc). For Python - obviously know the basic stuff, but a lot of the nice-to-haves that I dont understand. Like yeah I'm very familiar with the raw types and basic concepts like dicts, lists, mutability etc, have extensively used Flask, and also built \"production apps\". But I find that I lack for example proper understanding of when/where would I need to use stuff like dataclasses, or other niceties of python. Due to my day job - which usually involves \"shipping quickly\" - I find that I dont really follow the best practices/probably dont really write \"clean\" code. Part of it is also just some practice that comes from the jupyter notebook type of prototyping because I do quite a bit of ML research and the code that you write there isnt really ever \"clean\" or prod grade What are some intermediate level books to learn from/learn design patterns and OOP applications from? For example - when would I need to build abstractions when building CRUD apps/ when to just let it be? I'm looking for stuff like the interpreter book in Go but for my usecase.\n\nGave that example because I really want a resource to \"do\" stuff instead of just read/have small exercises at the end to solve - I dont really feel I learn much from that.\n\nMaybe also stuff like \"practical version\" of the Designing Data intensive applications or similar books.\n\n  \nTLDR:\n\nDecently experienced in terms of just programming - looking for stuff that is like \"The Interpreter book using Go\" but for Python + Design pattern related stuff. Any suggestions?",

As a solo security person I don't have the time or skills to vett every package and version and built artifact.\n* Pricing should be usage based - preferably with fine-grained pay-as-you-go metering. Many that do price on usage tend to be course grained on pre-selected amounts rather than metered. Pricing should absolutely not be priced on number of users.\n\nSo far I've not found anything that suits - so please provide your recommendations / reviews if you have any.\n\nHere's things I've looked at so far:\n\n* [**Inedo ProGet**](https://inedo.com/proget/features) \\- mostly self-hosted, very coarse grained pricing.\n* [**ActiveState**](https://www.activestate.com/platform/supported-languages/python/) \\- appears to mostly be container based, doesn't look like standard private respository hosting.\n* [**Cloudsmith**](https://cloudsmith.com/product/formats/python-repository) \\- looks like the cloest thing, their minimum pricing is still a lot for tiny teams / organisations.\n* [**JFrog**](https://jfrog.com/pricing/) \\- Epensive coarse grained pricing\n* [**Sonatype (Nexus / Firewall)**](https://www.sonatype.com/products/pricing) \\- expensive per user based pricing. Self hosted Nexus is a lot of manual work.\n\nFinally, I'm aware that there are CI/CD based solutions for this, but really want to push it at the repository level because generally speaking they also give access to things like centralised reporting and SBOMs.",

    "content": "Hello there!  \nI am working in web development for three years and I've got a strong glimpse at most of the programming languages out there. I know CSharp, Python and JavaScript and I've toyed with many others too. My main question is what can you actually build with Python more than app backends or software for machine learning and data science?\n\nThere's like lots of libraries designed for making desktop applications or games in Python or physics simulations and much more. But I am pretty sure I've never seen and used an app that is entirely written in Python. At best, I've seen some internal dashboards or tools made at my workplace to monitor our project's parameters and stuff.\n\nThere seems to be lots of potential for Python with all these frameworks and libaries supported by so many people. Yet, I can't find an application that is successful and destined for the normal user like a drawing program, a game or an communication app. I know that Python is pretty slow, sometimes dozens of times slower than CSharp/Java. But there are JIT compilers available, an official one is right now in development.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy writing Python much more because of it's more functional approach. Sending an input string through sockets in Java is as complicated as instantiating a Socket, a DataInputStream, a DataOutputStream, a Scanner and some more objects I don't remember the name of. In Python it's as easy as passing a string through functions. Java likes to hide primitives behind class walls while Python embraces their use.\n\nSo, realistically speaking, what makes Python so unpopular for real, native app development compared to other languages? Given the fact that now the performance gap is closing and hardware is faster?\n\nThanks!",

Plus, with PEP 723 support, your scripts become truly portable and shareable.\n\nHere's what a PEP 723 script looks like:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"&gt;=3.9\"\n# dependencies = [\n#     \"cowsay\"\n# ]\n# ///\nimport cowsay\n\ncowsay.cow(\"Hello World!\")\n```\n\nYou can copy this script anywhere, share it with anyone, and it'll just work — no setup instructions needed.\n\n## What My Project Does\n\nMy extension provides:\n* `uv` integration built directly into VS Code\n* Add, remove, and update packages without touching the terminal\n* Automatic PEP 723 script metadata detection and management\n* Complete LSP support (autocomplete, type checking, go-to-definition) for scripts\n* One-click run and debug for scripts\n* Smart virtual environment handling behind the scenes\n\nBasically, you get the speed and power of `uv` with the convenience of never leaving your editor, plus a better way to write and share self-contained Python scripts.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nThis is mainly aimed at:\n* Python developers who want faster package management in their workflow\n* People who love quick scripts and prototypes without the setup overhead\n* Developers who want to share scripts that \"just work\" for anyone\n\nI've been using it daily for my own work and would love to hear your feedback!

Think of it as a “TL;DR” for your codebase. \n\nIt generates a general summary by extracting the names of classes and functions, without including the actual code. As long as the variable, class, and function names are meaningful, the AI can easily understand their purpose.\n### Target audience\nPython developers who want brief summary of their project for onboarding and documentation generation.\n### Comparison\nThe tool is similiar to Repomix but doesn't include the source code in the output. I tried to feed Repomix output to local models on Ollama and models couldn't read majority of the file because the file was too large.\n\n### Installation\n**Source code:** [https://github.com/yegekucuk/git2mind](https://github.com/yegekucuk/git2mind)\nThe project is on PyPi so you can install with pip. The README file is fairly detailed and easy to read, you can find the flags, usage tips and examples there. You can install and try the tool as easy as this:\n```sh\n# Install\npip install git2mind\n# Run (Generate summary of current directory)\ng2m .\n```\n\nFor now, the project really summarizes only Python projects. Currently, git2mind parses Python, Markdown, and Dockerfile files. But I plan to add parsers for many other programming languages. ",

    "title": "Uber Eats Account Generator Showcase, and ethical concerns?",
    "content": "Hey yall, I wanted to discuss the ethical concerns about this new project I did. This area in python on web scraping &amp; automation has pretty divided opinions based on what im seeing so far, so im looking to get your guys insight on things. \n\n  \nSo I got into automation not too long ago, there was this guy in a small community im in asking for help on this project he was doing related to uber, so I tried helping but didn't really have the answers to his questions. His solution required mobile requests, so I started to do more research on it. I hit a hard block for around a week, as there are BARLEY any resources on youtube or online in general. Most the guides are very simple and just scratch the surface. I had to do a lot of trial and error and finally got a medium understanding on this area of automation. After spending a long time purely on research and starting to build the project, I finished the prototype if you would call it that in around a month or so working almost every day. In the middle of this, I asked others for help in different web scraping communities, and I had quite a few chats on the ethics of this project. So, as any normal person would do, I tried looking for anything related to any developer or technical support team I could report this issue to. There was no reliable places I could email or submit a form, and reliable in the sense that they actually listen and attempt to do anything about this problem. I talked with their normal support team, and they kept telling me things like 'I will escalate your case sir' which pissed me off, because I know damn well they ghosted me each time. So my opinion on this topic is that it should be allowed to do research and have practice and open sourced material for learning, and companies should have a dedicated(and actually helpful) support team for developers and people who actually know their stuff. These projects help out the companies security a lot as well. However, the other opinion I heard was that the user experience would go down when companies add more security, such as captcha and stuff. But cmon, is the user experience really that important to where we sacrifice security?? So honestly would want your thoughts on this, and see other perspectives on this, especially in an era where bots are becoming really advanced.\n\n  \nNow heres the brief description overview/showcase of my project:\n\n* Automatically generates uber eats accounts all using their mobile api\n* To make this, I used a jailbroken iphone(to bypass ssl pinning) and mitmproxy to capture the network requests of their api\n* Built it out using python curl\\_cffi library to make requests, useful for spoofing the tls handshake to make the requests look more authentic\n* Options to use catch-all domains with googles imap, or a list of hotmail accounts, to generate mass amounts in batch.\n* Auto gets the OTP code on signup from either hotmail or google imap\n*  And a couple other stuff like proxy support, multi imap domain support, and spoofed device data and signature to avoid spam looking account generations.\n\n  \nIf anyone would like to check it out, its open-sourced on github here: [https://github.com/yubunus/Uber-Eats-Account-Generator](https://github.com/yubunus/Uber-Eats-Account-Generator)\n\n  \nHonestly the learning curve on this was brutal, im thinking of maybe making my own youtube video to guide beginners, with something thats actually a bit more advanced and not some basic api requests like most youtube videos I watched during my research. Let me know if thats something yall would be interested in. But do you guys think there should be more educational resources covering this?",

    "title": "Made A Video Media Player that Plays Multi-Track Audio with Python",
    "content": "# Crusty Media Player\n\nI made a media player that was built to be able to take Multi-Track Video Files (ex: If you clip Recordings with separate Audio Tracks like System Audio and Microphone Audio) and give you the ability to play them back with both tracks synced without the use of an external editing software like Premiere Pro! And it's Open Source!\n\n# What This Project Does.\n\nIt utilizes [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) bundled in to rip apart audio tracks from multi-tracked video media and [PyQt6](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt6-widgets) to build the application and display video media.\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/CrustyMonk/Crusty-Media-Player) **&lt;---- Repo Here**\n\n[Crusty Media Player v0.1.1](https://github.com/CrustyMonk/Crusty-Media-Player/releases/tag/MediaPlayer) **&lt;---- First Downloadable Release Here**\n\n# Why Did I Make This?\n\nIt's simple really lol. I like clipping funny and cool parts of when my friends and I play video games and such. I also like sometimes editing the videos as a hobby! To make the video editing simpler I have my recording settings set to record two tracks of audio, my system audio, and my microphone audio separate. The problem lies in that, if I ever want to just pull up a clip to show a friend or something, with any other media player I've used I am only able to select one track or the other! I have to open Premiere pro with my game running (Making my machine use a lot of resources!) and drag the clip into Premiere. This solves that problem by being able to just open the file with the low resource app and watch the clip with all the audio goods!\n\n# Target Audience?\n\nIf you really have that niche issue that I have, then Crusty Media Player might be perfect for you! I just have the .exe pinned to my task bar so I can run it whenever I get the urge to show off or even just view a clip!\n\n# Quick Start\n\n0. Download the packaged zip folder containing the .exe and bundled packages from the [Downloadable Release](https://github.com/CrustyMonk/Crusty-Media-Player/releases/tag/MediaPlayer)\n\n1. Extract zip folder contents to desired location\n2. Run the **Crusty\\_Media\\_Player.exe**\n3. If prompted with \"Windows protected your PC\" Pop-up, just click \"More Info\" and then \"Run Anyway\"\n4. Open Video Files that contain up to two tracks of audio (i.e. System and Microphone Audio)\n5. Watch the media all in sync! (Without the use of an editing software!)\n\nI would really appreciate any constructive criticism and any suggestions on things that I could add it for ease of use in future releases as well!\n\n# Comparison\n\nMedia Players like VLC and such also play video files from your computer. When using these tools though, you are always unable to play both audio tracks for multi-tracked videos simultaneously! Crusty Media Player fixes this problem, making you able to view multi-track audio media with both tracks simultaneously without the use of any resource heavy editing software like Premiere Pro or Filmora.\n\n# TLDR\n\n**Crusty Media Player** is a media player that was built to be able to take Multi-Track Video Files (ex: If you clip Recordings with separate Audio Tracks like System Audio and Microphone Audio) and give you the ability to play them back with both tracks synced without the use of an external editing software like Premiere Pro!",

It's getting to the point where we seriously need to start profiling and adding optimizations, and I'm not sure of what tooling exists for this kind of stack. I'm used to compiled languages where it is much more straight-forward. We do not have proper tracing spans or anything of the sort. What's a good solution to profiling this sort of application?

    "content": "Hey folks! I've been working on an open-source project called **doespythonhaveit**, a **semantic search engine for Python libraries** powered by `FastAPI` and `sentence-transformers`.\n\nBasically, you can type something like:\n\n&gt;\"machine learning time series\"\n\nand it'll (hopefully) suggest things like scikit-learn or darts.\n\nThe goal is to make discovering Python libraries faster, smarter, and a little less about keyword guessing.\n\nIt's not live *yet* (hosting the model costs a bit), but you can **try it locally**, setup instructions are in the repos:\n\n* API: [github.com/hasboi/doespythonhaveit-api](https://github.com/hasboi/doespythonhaveit-api)\n* Web: [github.com/hasboi/doespythonhaveit-web](https://github.com/hasboi/doespythonhaveit-web)\n\n---\n\n# What My Project Does\n\n**doespythonhaveit** lets you search Python libraries *by meaning*, not by exact keywords. Instead of googling *\"python library for handling CSVs elegantly\"* and clicking through five Stack Overflow posts, you can just search that sentence directly — and it'll understand what you mean using embeddings.\n\nI am also planning a **terminal version**, so you can type something like:\n\n    dphi &lt;query&gt; &lt;flags&gt;\n\nand it will suggest relevant libraries **without leaving your code editor or terminal**, basically a semantic library search right where you write code.\n\n---\n\n# Target Audience\n\nMainly aimed at:\n\n* **Developers** who are tired of remembering exact library names\n* **Beginners** who want to discover tools without knowing where to start\n* **Open-source enthusiasts** who love browsing cool Python projects\n\nRight now it's mostly a **toy project / prototype**, but I’m hoping to make it stable enough for production someday.\n\n---\n\n# Comparison\n\nIt's kinda like if pypi.org and Google had a baby, but that baby actually understands what you're looking for. Unlike traditional search (which relies on exact matches), this one uses semantic similarity. So searching \"plotting dataframes nicely\" might bring up seaborn or plotly, even if you never mention the words \"plot\" or \"graph.\"\n\nIf you'd like to support deployment and hosting, you can sponsor me via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hasboi) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/hasboi).\n\nAlso, contributions are super welcome! 🙌 I am looking for:\n\n* More Python libraries to add to the dataset\n* Help cleaning and improving the dataset, so results are more accurate and relevant\n* Ideas for improving the search algorithm\n\nEverything else (tech details, install guide, roadmap, etc.) is in the repos. Would love your feedback, PRs, or just general thoughts! 💬",

Works offline, open source (MIT);\n\n\\~40MB standalone.\n\n# Source code\n\n[**GitHub**](https://github.com/Commonwealthrocks/PyLI) **&lt;-- here!**\n\nMore can be seen on my repo's README file, I recommend reading it before trying the app.\n\n# What my project does?\n\nEncrypts files using **AES-256-GCM (AEAD)** or **ChaCha20-Poly1305** locally on your PC / machine; uses **Argon2ID** as said earlier of **PBDKF2** for KDF.\n\n  \nAll cryptowork is tweakable in the settings of the app.\n\n# QUICK START\n\n0.

Choose a password, any kind for a simple test really\n\n4. Hit encrypt / decrypt\n\nIt is recommended to also check out the apps settings tab, especially for archive mode and the crypto tweaks.\n\n# FEATURES (as said earlier)\n\n\\- **AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305** encryption\n\n\\- Archive mode (encrypt multiple files into one; basically knockoff .zip files)\n\n\\- Optional compression\n\n\\- Optional error correction (Reedsolo)\n\n\\- Works completely offline\n\n# COMPARISON\n\nTools like **WinRAR** or **7-zip** MIGHT do similar but they are compression focused; **PyLI** is dedicated to security / encryption. More dedicated tools for this stuff like **VeraCrypt** is for whole disks, overkill for regular files or **AxCrypt** which is also based on security.

    "title": "gitfluff: Commit Message Linter (Conventional Commits + AI signature cleanup)",
    "content": "Hey Peeps,\n\nI'm pleased to show case a new small and very fast commit message linter and autofixer tool [gitfluff](https://github.com/Goldziher/gitfluff).\n\n## What My Project Does\n\nClaude Code kept injecting \"🤖 Co-Authored-By\" trailers into commits. You can disable it now in local settings, but I needed team-wide enforcement across multiple repos and multiple languages. Plus I wanted strict Conventional Commits validation without cobbling together multiple tools.\n\n## What it does\n\n- **Enforces Conventional Commits 1.0.0** (type, scope, breaking changes, footers) with full spec compliance.\n- **Strips AI signatures** automatically (configurable patterns)\n- **Validates or rewrites** messages in place with `--write`\n- **Zero config** to start, optional `.gitfluff.toml` for custom rules which allow you to do whatever you want basically. \n\n## Install &amp; Use\n\nThe tool is written and rust and is compiled to multiple platforms. You can install it directly via cargo:\n\n```bash\ncargo install gitfluff\n```\n\nOr using homebrew:\n\n```bash\nbrew install goldziher/tap/gitfluff\n```\n\nOr via NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g gitfluff\n```\n\nOr via PIP:\n\n```bash\npip install gitfluff\n```\n\nYou can then install it as a commit message hook:\n\n```bash\ngitfluff hook install commit-msg --write\n```\n\nAlternatively you can install it as a hook for `pre-commit` (or `prek`) by adding the following to you `.pre-commit-config`:\n\n```yaml\nrepos:\n  - repo: https://github.com/Goldziher/gitfluff\n    rev: v0.2.0\n    hooks:\n      - id: gitfluff-lint\n        name: gitfluff (lint)\n        entry: gitfluff lint --from-file\n        language: system\n        stages: [commit-msg]\n        args: [\"{commit_msg_file}\"]\n\n      # or using the autofix hook:\n\n      # - id: gitfluff-write\n      #  name: gitfluff (lint + write)\n      #  entry: gitfluff lint --from-file\n      #  language: system\n      #  stages: [commit-msg]\n      #  args: [\"{commit_msg_file}\", \"--write\"]\n```\n\nAnd then run `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`, which will install the hook correctly. \n\nYou can also integrate it into `lefthook` or `husky` using `npx` or `uvx` commands!\n\nMain workflow: add to pre-commit config, forget about it. Devs commit normally, hook validates/cleans messages before they hit history.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nTeams enforcing commit conventions across polyglot projects. Devs using AI coding assistants who want clean commit history. Anyone who needs Conventional Commits validation without JavaScript dependencies.\n\n## Comparison\n\n- **commitlint** (Node ecosystem, requires separate config for cleanups)\n- **cocogitto** (Rust, focused on semver release workflows)\n- **gitlint** (Python, extensible but requires custom plugins for AI signatures)\n\nAnd many other tools of course, I cant claim this is original. The main difference is that `gitfluff` combines validation + pattern cleanup in one binary with prebuilt distributions for all major platforms.\n\nAs usual, if you like the tool, star [github.com/Goldziher/gitfluff](https://github.com/Goldziher/gitfluff).",

Its pretty slow (although its surprisingly fast for being written in Python)\n2. The maintainer ([asottile](https://github.com/asottile)) made it very clear that he is not willing to introduce monorepo support or any other advanced features (e.g. parallelization) asked over the years\n\nI was following this project from its inception (whats now called Prek) and it evolved both very fast and very well. I am now using it across multiple project, e.g. in [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg), both locally and in CI and it does bring in an at least x10 speed improvement (linting and autoupdate commands!)\n\nSo, I warmly recommend this tool, and do show your support for Prek by giving it a star!",

    "content": "I recently developed [blank-line-after-blocks](https://github.com/jsh9/blank-line-after-blocks), a Python auto-formatter to improve code readability and prevent human errors.\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nIt adds a blank line after if/for/while/with/try blocks. See the example below (the lines with `+` sign are added by this formatter.\n\n      if condition:\n          do_something()\n    +\n      next_statement()  if condition:\n          do_something()\n    +\n      next_statement()\n\n**Why is it s a good idea to add a blank line after blocks?**\n\nThis can improve readability:\n\n* A blank line sends a visual cue that a block ends here\n* A blank line makes it easier to distinguish `if` and `if/else` blocks. Look at this example\n\nHard to distinguish:\n\n    if a &gt; 2:\n        print(a)\n    if b &lt; 3:\n        print(b)\n    else:\n        print('1')\n\nEasier to distinguish\n\n    if a &gt; 2:\n        print(a)\n    \n    if b &lt; 3:\n        print(b)\n    else:\n        print('1')\n\nHaving a blank line after blocks can also reduce the chance of human errors. Sometimes we accidentally hit \"Tab\" or \"Backspace\" on our keyboards. This could introduce costly errors in Python, because Python relies on indentation as syntax cues.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n    raw_result = 0\n    for i in range(10):\n        raw_result += i\n    final_result = my_func(raw_result)\n\nIf we accidentally hit \"Tab\" on the last line, the code becomes:\n\n    raw_result = 0\n    for i in range(10):\n        raw_result += i\n        final_result = my_func(raw_result)\n\nwhich will yield a completely different result. **This error is very difficult to find, thus a costly error.**\n\nBut if we add a blank line after the block,\n\n    raw_result = 0\n    for i in range(10):\n        raw_result += i\n    \n        final_result = my_func(raw_result)\n\nIt would be ***slightly*** easier to find out the error.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nAnyone who writes Python code. But this is especially helpful for production-level code, because reducing diffs and reducing human errors can be valuable.\n\n# Comparison with Alternatives\n\nAs far as I know, there are no alternatives. No existing Python formatter does this.  \n  \n",

    "title": "I built a classic \"Crack the Code\" console game in Python: Digit Detective 🕵️‍♀️",
    "content": "Hello everyone! I'm sharing my completed project: Digit Detective, a pure Python console game.\n\nMy goal was to create a clean, working implementation of a code-breaking puzzle game, focusing on clean structure and good input validation.\n\n\n\n# 🔍 What My Project Does (The Game and Code)\n\n\n\nDigit Detective is a command-line utility where you try to crack a secret 4-digit numeric code in 8 attempts.\n\n* Gameplay: The game gives you instant, clear textual feedback after each guess, indicating how many digits are:\n   1. Correct and in the Right Position.\n   2. Correct but in the Wrong Position.\n* Code Focus: The project demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), robust input validation to prevent non-numeric guesses, and clear separation of game logic. It's a single, runnable Python file.\n\n\n\n# 🎯 Target Audience\n\n\n\nWhile anyone can play, the project is structured to benefit specific audiences:\n\n* Python Beginners/Learners: The code is straightforward. It's an excellent, simple project to read, clone, and understand basic game loop structure and logic implementation.\n* Fans of Mastermind: If you enjoy classic code-breaking puzzles, this offers a fast, clean, terminal-based version.\n\n\n\n# 🆚 Comparison:\n\n\n\nThis project is inspired by the logic of Mastermind, but adapted for the modern terminal environment. Unlike the classic board game:\n\n* It deals exclusively with a 4-digit numeric code (0-9) instead of colored pegs, simplifying input.\n* It provides instant, unambiguous textual hints instead of relying on manually tracking black and white pegs.\n* The entire experience is self-contained in a single, accessible Python script, emphasizing a focus on logic and code execution over complex UI.\n\nFeel free to check out the [digit-detective.py](http://digit-detective.py) file. I’d appreciate any feedback on the Python logic, structure, or best practices!\n\nGitHub Link:[https://github.com/itsleenzy/digit-detective](https://github.com/itsleenzy/digit-detective)",

    "content": "A while back I made [Nyxelf](https://github.com/m3rcurylake/Nyxelf/), a static and dynamic analysis toolkit. Well, in a sentence, it got overhauled to a great extent. \n\nWhat it does :\nIt provides a professional report of the executable, I replaced the simple strace dynamic analysis system with BPFtrace, Valgrind and tcpdump running on a minimal buildroot image, tracing dynamic and memory activity, along with capturing network packets, which is further enhanced with ai-assisted summerisation of the dynamic analysis. I used pyelftools, capstone etc for static analysis, which detects symbols, functions, sections, headers, .rodata variables etc. Finally it disassembles the binary to readable C and x64 intel Assembly with capstone, r2pipe and angr. And this entire thing is presented on the screen with pywebview with a cool one-dark theme.\n\nTarget Audience:\nDirect audience are security enthusiasts, professionals, reverse engineers, anyone wanting a quick scan on a suspicious file. According to me it can be used by both offensive and defensive teams.\n\nComparisons : \nIt is not very hard to find comparisons or inspirations in this area. I was using ghidra on almost a regular basis, so I just wanted something similar but minimal with power of dynamic analysis and ai overview, though it comes nowhere near the power of ghidra. A direct comparison would be [LiSa](https://github.com/danielpoliakov/lisa) by danielpoliakov which uses SystemTap instead of eBPF for tracing. \n\nCritisisms are welcome. Suggestions are highly appreciated. Thanks for checking this out.",

    "title": "I built a modern async Python SDK for Expo Push Notifications (with full type hints!)",
    "content": "I've been working with Expo push notifications in Python and got frustrated with the limitations of existing SDKs - no async support, limited type safety, and missing modern features. So I built \\*\\*async-expo-push-notifications\\*\\*.\n\n\n\n\\## What My Project Does\n\n\n\nA Python SDK for sending push notifications through Expo's push notification service. It provides both async and sync interfaces for sending notifications to mobile apps built with Expo/React Native. The library handles message validation, batching, error handling, and provides full type safety with Pydantic models.\n\n\n\n\\## Target Audience\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Production-ready\\*\\* for developers building:\n\n\\- FastAPI/Django/ETC backends that need async push notifications\n\n\\- Python servers communicating with Expo/React Native mobile apps\n\n\\- Applications requiring type-safe, testable notification systems\n\n\\- High-performance apps sending concurrent notifications\n\n\n\nRequires Python 3.8+ and works with any modern Python web framework.\n\n\n\n\\## Comparison\n\n\n\nCompared to the existing \\[expo-server-sdk-python\\](https://github.com/expo-community/expo-server-sdk-python):\n\n\n\n| Feature | async-expo-push-notifications | expo-server-sdk-python |\n\n|---------|------------------------------|------------------------|\n\n| Async/await support | ✅ Full async | ❌ Sync only |\n\n| Type hints | ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Partial |\n\n| Pydantic models | ✅ Type-safe validation | ❌ Named tuples |\n\n| Dependency injection | ✅ Testable | ❌ No |\n\n| Rich content (images) | ✅ Supported | ❌ No |\n\n| Backward compatible | ✅ Drop-in replacement | - |\n\n\n\nThe official SDK is great for synchronous use cases, but lacks modern Python features. This SDK provides the same API while adding async support, full type safety, and better testability - perfect for modern async Python applications.\n\n\n\n\\## Quick Example\n\n\n\n\\`\\`\\`python\n\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom exponent\\_server\\_sdk import AsyncPushClient, PushMessage\n\n\n\nasync def send\\_notification():\n\nasync with AsyncPushClient() as client:\n\nmessage = PushMessage(\n\nto=\"ExponentPushToken\\[xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\]\",\n\ntitle=\"Hello\",\n\nbody=\"World!\",\n\ndata={\"extra\": \"data\"}\n\n)\n\nticket = await client.publish(message)\n\nticket.validate\\_response()\n\n\n\nasyncio.run(send\\_notification())\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Installation:\\*\\*\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n\npip install async-expo-push-notifications\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\nThe synchronous API still works exactly the same, so you can migrate gradually. All your existing code continues to work without changes.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Why I built this:\\*\\*\n\nThe official community SDK is great but hasn't been updated with modern Python features. I wanted something that works seamlessly with async frameworks like FastAPI and provides the type safety that modern Python developers expect.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Important note:\\*\\* This is an independent project and not officially maintained by Expo. It's a modern reimplementation with async support.\n\n\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/tmdgusya/async-expo-notification-sdk](https://github.com/tmdgusya/async-expo-notification-sdk)\n\nPyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/async-expo-push-notifications/](https://pypi.org/project/async-expo-push-notifications/)\n\n\n\nWould love to hear your feedback and contributions are welcome!

    "content": "Hi everyone\n\nI've been helping to build [plugboard](https://github.com/plugboard-dev/plugboard) - a framework for modelling complex processes.\n\n## What is it for?\n\nWe originally started out helping data scientists to build models of industrial processes where there are lots of stateful, interconnected components. Think of a digital twin for a mining process, or a simulation of multiple steps in a factory production line.\n\nPlugboard lets you define each component of the model as a Python class and then takes care of the flow of data between the components as you run your model. It really shines when you have many components and lots of connections between them (including loops and branches). \n\nWe've since enhanced it with:\n\n* Support for event-based models;\n* Built-in optimisation, so you can fine-tune your model to achieve/optimise a specific output;\n* Integration with [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) for running computationally intensive models in a distributed environment.\n\n## Target audience\n\nAnyone who is interested in modelling complex systems, processes, and digital twins. Particularly if you've faced the challenges of running data-intensive models in Python, and wished for a framework to make it easier. Would love to hear from anyone with experience in these areas.\n\n## Links\n\n* Repo: https://github.com/plugboard-dev/plugboard\n* Documentation: https://docs.plugboard.dev/latest/\n* Tutorials: https://docs.plugboard.dev/latest/examples/tutorials/hello-world/\n* Usage examples: https://docs.plugboard.dev/latest/examples/demos/fundamentals/001_simple_model/simple-model/\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Reusable classes** containing the core framework, which you can extend to define your own model logic;\n- Support for different simulation paradigms: **discrete time** and **event based**.\n- **YAML model specification** format for saving model definitions, allowing you to run the same model locally or in cloud infrastructure;\n- A **command line interface** for executing models;\n- Built to handle the **data intensive simulation** requirements of industrial process applications;\n- Modern implementation with **Python 3.12 and above** based around **asyncio** with complete type annotation coverage;\n- Built-in integrations for **loading/saving data** from cloud storage and SQL databases;\n- **Detailed logging** of component inputs, outputs and state for monitoring and process mining or surrogate modelling use-cases.\n",

    "title": "An open source access logs analytics script to block Bot attacks",
    "content": "We built a small Python project for web server access logs analyzing to classify and dynamically block bad bots, such as L7 (application-level) DDoS bots, web scrappers and so on.\n\nWe'll be happy to gather initial feedback on usability and features, especially from people having good or bad experience wit bots.\n\nThe project is available at [Github](https://github.com/tempesta-tech/webshield/) and has a [wiki page](https://tempesta-tech.com/knowledge-base/Bot-Protection/)\n\n\n**Requirements**\n\nThe analyzer relies on 3 Tempesta FW specific features which you still can get with other HTTP servers or accelerators:\n\n1.  [JA5 client fingerprinting](https://tempesta-tech.com/knowledge-base/Traffic-Filtering-by-Fingerprints/). This is a HTTP and TLS layers fingerprinting, similar to [JA4](https://blog.foxio.io/ja4%2B-network-fingerprinting) and JA3 fingerprints. The last is also available in [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/listener/tls\\_inspector/v3/tls\\_inspector.proto.html) or [Nginx module](https://github.com/fooinha/nginx-ssl-ja3), so check the documentation for your web server\n2. Access logs are directly written to Clickhouse analytics database, which can cunsume large data batches and quickly run analytic queries. For other web proxies beside Tempesta FW, you typically need to build a custom pipeline to load access logs into Clickhouse. Such pipelines aren't so rare though.\n3. Abbility to block web clients by IP or JA5 hashes. IP blocking is probably available in any HTTP proxy.\n\n\n\n**How does it work**\n\nThis is a daemon, which\n\n1. Learns normal traffic profiles: means and standard deviations for client requests per second, error responses, bytes per second and so on. Also it remembers client IPs and fingerprints.\n2. If it sees a spike in [z-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard\\_score) for traffic characteristics or can be triggered manually. Next, it goes in data model search mode\n3. For example, the first model could be top 100 JA5 HTTP hashes, which produce the most error responses per second (typical for password crackers). Or it could be top 1000 IP addresses generating the most requests per second (L7 DDoS). Next, this model is going to be verified\n4. The daemon repeats the query, but for some time, long enough history, in the past to see if in the past we saw a hige fraction of clients in both the query results. If yes, then the model is bad and we got to previous step to try another one. If not, then we (likely) has found the representative query.\n5. Transfer the IP addresses or JA5 hashes from the query results into the web proxy blocking configuration and reload the proxy configuration (on-the-fly).\n",

Because policies live in Postgres, they apply to *any* client (ORM, psql, ETL).\n\n**Key bits (beta):** management commands like `anon_init`/`anon_dump`, `AnonRoleMiddleware` for automatic role switching, `anonymized_data` context manager, `use_anonymized_data` decorator, admin helpers, and presets for common PII. Requires Postgres with the anonymizer extension enabled.\n\n**Quickstart**\n\n    pip install django-postgres-anonymizer==0.1.0b1\n    # add app + settings, then:\n    python manage.py anon_init\n\n(You’ll need a Postgres where you can install/enable the anonymizer extension before using the Django layer.)\n\n# Target Audience\n\n* **Django teams on Postgres** who need **production-like datasets** for local dev, CI, or ephemeral review apps - without shipping live PII.\n* Orgs that prefer **DB-enforced masking** (central policy, fewer “missed spots” in app code).\n* Current status: **beta (**`v0.1.0b1`**) -** great for dev/test pipelines; evaluate carefully before critical prod paths.\n\nTypical workflows: share realistic fixtures within the team/CI, seed preview environments with masked data, and reproduce bugs that only surface with prod-like distributions.\n\n# Comparison (how it differs)\n\n* **vs Faker/synthetic fixtures:** Faker creates *plausible but synthetic* data; distributions often drift. DB-level masking preserves **real distributions and relationships** while removing PII.\n* **vs app-layer masking (serializers/views):** easy to miss code paths. DB policies apply across **ORM, psql, ETL**, etc., reducing leakage risk.\n* **vs using the extension directly:** this package adds **Django-friendly commands/middleware/decorators/presets** so teams don’t hand-roll plumbing each time.\n\n**Status &amp; Asks**  \nThis is **beta**—I’d love feedback on:\n\n* Missing PII recipes\n* Managed-provider quirks (does your provider expose the extension?)\n* DX rough edges in admin/tests/CI\n\nIf it’s useful, a ⭐ on the repo and comments here really help prioritize the roadmap. 🙏",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve built a lightweight backtesting library called `Antback`\n\n**What my project does**\n\nAntback is a small, practical tool for backtesting trading ideas. It was primarily designed for rotational strategies, calendar effects, or other situations where a vectorized approach is difficult or impossible. It’s built to be clear, explicit, and easy to use with any kind of data. The README has some documentation, but the [examples](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback/tree/main/examples) are the best place to start: \n\n**Target audience**\n\nAntback is for anyone who wants to experiment with different investment strategies, inspect each transaction in detail, or compare results with other libraries.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nUnlike many backtesting frameworks that rely on an inheritance-based approach like `class SmaCross(Strategy)` or hide logic behind layers of abstraction, Antback takes a more explicit, function-driven design. It uses efficient stateful helper functions and data containers instead of complex class hierarchies. This makes it easier to understand what’s happening at each step. Antback also produces interactive HTML or XLSX reports, so you can clearly filter and inspect every trade.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback](https://github.com/ts-kontakt/antback)\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "[https://github.com/ajcr/jinx](https://github.com/ajcr/jinx)\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nI wrote this toy interpreter for a chunk of the [J programming language](https://www.jsoftware.com/#/README) (an array programming language) using NumPy as the array engine.\n\nMy goal was to understand J a bit better. J was an influence on NumPy, but is markedly different in how the user is able to build and control the application of functions over a multidimensional arrays (you control the *rank* of the method you're applying, you don't specify axes or think about broadcasting).\n\nJ has a [large set of primitives](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/NuVoc) that operate on arrays, or else produce new objects that operate on arrays. It can look confusing at first. For example:\n\n    +/ % #\n\nare three distinct verbs (think: function) that, when arranged in this way, create a new verb that find the arithmetic mean of an array. Similarly:\n\n    1&amp;|.&amp;.#:\n\ncreates a verb that solves the [Josephus problem](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Essays/Josephus_Problem).\n\nDespite looking unusual, parsing J code and executing it it is actually relatively straightforward. There is no complicated grammar or precedence rules. In my project:\n\n* Tokenization (breaking the code into words) is done in [word\\_formation.py](https://github.com/ajcr/jinx/blob/main/src/jinx/word_formation.py) (using a transition table and single scan from left-to-right)\n* Spelling (recognising these words as parts of J) is done in [word\\_spelling.py](https://github.com/ajcr/jinx/blob/main/src/jinx/word_spelling.py) (just a few methods to detect what the words are, and parsing of numbers)\n* Evaluation (executing the code) is done in [word\\_evaluation.py](https://github.com/ajcr/jinx/blob/main/src/jinx/word_evaluation.py) (repeated use of`case`/ `match` to check for 8 different patterns in a fragment of the code)\n\nMost of the complexity I found was in defining the different language primitives in terms of NumPy and Python and working out how to apply these primitives to multidimensional arrays of different shapes (see for example [application.py](https://github.com/ajcr/jinx/blob/main/src/jinx/execution/numpy/application.py) and [verbs.py](https://github.com/ajcr/jinx/blob/main/src/jinx/execution/numpy/verbs.py)).\n\nThe main reference books I used were:\n\n1. [An Implementation of J](https://www.jsoftware.com/books/pdf/aioj.pdf)\n2. [J for C Programmers](https://www.jsoftware.com/help/jforc/contents.htm)\n\n# Target Audience\n\nAnyone interested in programming with arrays or tensors, or understanding how J and similar array languages can be implemented.\n\nMaybe you've used NumPy or PyTorch before and are interested in seeing a different approach to working with multidimensional arrays.\n\n# Comparison\n\nI'm not aware of any other full or partial implementations of J written in Python. A few other toy implementations exist in other languages, but they do not seem to implement as much of J as my project does.\n\nThe [official J source code](https://github.com/jsoftware/jsource) is here.",

I started this project as I was annoyed at having to use lines and lines of switch case statements for another project I was working on\n\n# Comparison\nCompared to python's built in argparse, Parsegument has a more intuitive syntax, and makes it more convenient to route and execute functions. \n\nThis project is still super early in development, I aim to add other features like aliases, annotations, and more suggestions from you guys!",

It provides an interactive way to view, create, edit, and delete cron jobs, all from your terminal, without having to manually edit crontab files.\n\nPython powers the entire project: it runs the CLI interface, parses and validates cron expressions, manages SSH connections via `paramiko`, and formats job schedules in a human-readable way.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nCronboard is mainly aimed at **developers, sysadmins, and DevOps engineers** who work with cron jobs regularly and want a cleaner, more visual way to manage them.\n## Comparison\n\nUnlike tools such as `crontab -e` or GUI-based schedulers, Cronboard focuses on **terminal usability** and **clarity**. It gives immediate feedback when creating or editing jobs, translates cron expressions into plain English, and will soon support remote SSH-based management out of the box using ssh keys (for now, it supports remote ssh using hostname, username and password).\n\n## Features\n- Check existing cron jobs\n- Create cron jobs with validation and human-readable feedback\n- Pause and resume cron jobs\n- Edit existing cron jobs\n- Delete cron jobs\n- View formatted last and next run times\n- Connect to servers using SSH\n\nThe project is still in early development, so I’d really appreciate any feedback or suggestions!\n\n**GitHub Repository:** [github.com/antoniorodr/Cronboard](https://github.com/antoniorodr/Cronboard)",

A shortcut list was added in #71 that can be spawned with `?`, so if you are confused about any commands, just press the question mark! You can also search for any keybinds if necessary. rovr also integrates with [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), so you can simply enable the `finder` plugin and press `f` to start searching! yazi/spf style `--chooser-file` flag has also been added. An extra flag `--cwd-file` Also exists to allow you to grab the file if necessary (I'm planning to remove cd on quit to favour this instead) cases where opening a file results in a ui overwrite have also been resolved, and a lot more bugfixes!\n\nI would like to hear your opinion on how this can be improved. So far, the things that need to be done are a PDF preview, a config specifying flag, non-case-sensitivity of the rename operation and a bunch more.

Collect resources to unlock better technology and become the most efficient farmer in the world. Improve your problem solving and coding skills.\n\nUnlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression.\n\nFarming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology.\n\nProgramming is done in a simple language similar to Python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.\n\nWhile it introduces everything that is relevant, it won't hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.\n\nIf you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.\n\nAlthough the programming language isn't exactly Python, it's similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code. When the \"File Watcher\" setting is enabled, the game automatically detects external changes.\n\nYou can find it here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The\\_Farmer\\_Was\\_Replaced/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160?utm_source=RD)",

No manual thresholds needed.\n\n**Target Audience**\nFraud analysts, data scientists, security teams working with transactional or behavioral data.\n\n**Comparison**\nUnlike scikit-learn's anomaly detection (needs feature engineering) or PyOD (requires ML expertise), dataspot works directly on raw data structures and finds patterns automatically.\n\nFull story: \nhttps://3l1070r.dev/en/2025/01/24/building-dataspot.html\n\nUsed it in production to detect attacks and anomalies.\n\n- GitHub: https://github.com/frauddi/dataspot\n- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/dataspot/\n- Docs: https://frauddi.github.io/dataspot/\n\nQuestions welcome.\n",

    "title": "Announcing html-to-markdown v2: Rust rewrite, full CommonMark 1.2 compliance, and hOCR support",
    "content": "Hi Pythonistas,\n\nI'm glad to announce the v2 release of [html-to-markdown](https://github.com/Goldziher/html-to-markdown).\n\nThis library started life as a fork of `markdownify`, a Python library for converting HTML to Markdown. I forked it originally because I needed modern type hints, but then found myself rewriting the entire thing. Over time it became essential for [kreuzberg](https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg), where it serves as a backbone for both html -&gt; markdown and hOCR -&gt; markdown.\n\nI am working on Kreuzberg v4, which migrates much of it to Rust. This necessitated updating this component as well, which led to a full rewrite in Rust, offering improved performance, memory stability, and a more robust feature set.\n\nv2  delivers Rust-backed HTML → Markdown conversion with Python bindings, a CLI and a Rust crate. The rewrite makes this by far the most performance and complete solution for HTML to Markdown conversion in python. Here are some benchmarks:\n\nApple M4 • Real Wikipedia documents • `convert()` (Python)\n\n| Document            | Size  | Latency | Throughput | Docs/sec |\n| ------------------- | ----- | ------- | ---------- | -------- |\n| Lists (Timeline)    | 129KB | 0.62ms  | 208 MB/s   | 1,613    |\n| Tables (Countries)  | 360KB | 2.02ms  | 178 MB/s   | 495      |\n| Mixed (Python wiki) | 656KB | 4.56ms  | 144 MB/s   | 219      |\n\n&gt; V1 averaged ~2.5 MB/s (Python/BeautifulSoup). V2’s Rust engine delivers 60–80x higher throughput.\n\nThe Python package still exposes `markdownify`-style calls via `html_to_markdown.v1_compat`, so migrations are relatively straightforward, although the v2 did introduce some breaking changes (see CHANGELOG.md for full details).\n\n## Highlights\n\nHere are the key highlights of the v2 release aside from the massive performance improvements:\n\n- CommonMark-compliant defaults with explicit toggles when you need legacy behaviour.\n- Inline image extraction (`convert_with_inline_images`) that captures data URI assets and inline SVGs with sizing and quota controls.\n- Full hOCR 1.2 spec compliance, including hOCR table reconstruction and YAML frontmatter for metadata to keep OCR output structured.\n- Memory is kept kept in check by dedicated harnesses: repeated conversions stay under 200 MB RSS on multi-megabyte corpora.\n\n## Target Audience\n- Engineers replacing BeautifulSoup-based converters that fall apart on large documents or OCR outputs.\n- Python, Rust, and CLI users who need identical Markdown from libraries, pipelines, and batch tools.\n- Teams building document understanding stacks (including the kreuzberg ecosystem) that rely on tight memory behaviour and parallel throughput.\n- OCR specialists who need to process hOCR efficiently.\n\n## Comparison to Alternatives\n- [`markdownify`](https://github.com/matthewwithanm/python-markdownify): the spiritual ancestor, but still Python + BeautifulSoup. html-to-markdown v2 keeps the API shims while delivering 60–80× more throughput, table-aware hOCR support, and deterministic memory usage across repeated conversions.\n- [`html2text`](https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text): solid for quick scripts, yet it lacks CommonMark compliance and tends to drift on complex tables and OCR layouts; it also allocates heavily under pressure because it was never built with long-running processes in mind.\n- [`pandoc`](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc): extremely flexible (and amazing!), but large, much slower for pure HTML → Markdown pipelines, and not embeddable in Python without subprocess juggling. html-to-markdown v2 offers a slim Rust core with direct bindings, so you keep the performance while staying in-process.\n\nIf you end up using the rewrite, a ⭐️ on the [repo](https://github.com/Goldziher/html-to-markdown) always makes yours truly happy!",

    "title": "[FOSS] Flint: A 100% Config-Driven ETL Framework",
    "content": "I'd like to share **Flint**, a configuration-driven ETL framework that lets you define complete data pipelines through JSON/YAML instead of code.\n\n## What My Project Does\n\nFlint transforms straightforward ETL workflows from programming tasks into declarative configuration. Define your sources, transformations (select, filter, join, cast, etc.), and destinations in JSON or YAML - the framework handles execution. The processing engine is abstracted away, currently supporting Apache Spark with Polars in development.\n\n**It's not intended to replace all ETL development** - complex data engineering still needs custom code. Instead, it handles routine ETL tasks so engineers can focus on more interesting problems.\n\n## Target Audience\n- Data engineers tired of writing boilerplate for basic pipelines, so they ahve more time for more interesting programming tasks than straightforward ETL pipelines.\n- Teams wanting standardized ETL patterns\n- Organizations needing pipeline logic accessible to non-developers\n- Projects requiring multi-engine flexibility\n\n100% test coverage (unit + e2e), strong typing, extensive documentation with class and activity diagrams, and configurable alerts/hooks.\n\n## Comparison\n\nUnlike other transformation tools like DBT this one is configuration focused to reduce complexity and programming knowledge to make the boring ETL task simple, to keep more time for engineers for more intersting issues. This focuses on pure configuration without vendor lock-in as the backend key can be changed anytime with another implementation.\n\n## Future expansion\n\nThe foundation is solid - now looking to expand with new engines, add tracing/metrics, migrate CLI to Click, move from azure devops CICD to github actions, extend Polars transformations, and more.\n\n**[GitHub: config-driven-ETL-framework](https://github.com/krijnvanderburg/config-driven-ETL-framework)**.

    "content": "Hello,\n\nIn my work, I build many FastAPI applications, both internal and external, that expose endpoints to other product, business, and data teams, accessible via API keys. Each project eventually ended up with its own slightly different API key system, so I finally took the time to extract the common parts and combine them into a reusable library.\n\n[https://github.com/Athroniaeth/fastapi-api-key](https://github.com/Athroniaeth/fastapi-api-key)\n\nBefore publishing it publicly (not yet on PyPI, and the mkdocs documentation is still local), I’d like to get feedback from people who have solved similar problems (or just see what they think).\n\nThe goal is to see if I can improve this project or if there are any major security flaws (which would be problematic for an API key system).\n\nI built the library as follows:\n\n* **Security-first**: secrets are hashed with a salt and a pepper, and never logged or returned after creation\n* **Easy-to-use**: just inherited from the repository and use service\n* **Prod-ready**: services and repositories are async, and battle-tested\n* **Agnostic hasher**: you can use any async-compatible hashing strategy (default: Argon2)\n* **Agnostic backend**: you can use any async-compatible database (default: SQLAlchemy)\n* **Factory**: create a Typer, FastAPI router wired to api key systems (only SQLAlchemy for now)\n\n**I’d love feedback on (but not limited to) the following:**\n\n* Are there features you would expect that don’t exist?\n* Does the SQLAlchemy Mixin approach seem good for handling custom field extensions?\n* Do you see any potential flaws with the current hashing/peppering strategy?\n* What do you think about the extras/packaging approach (“core”, “fastapi”, “all”)?\n\nIs there anything else I should add to make it more usable?

If you've ever dealt with intricate dependencies between functions, struggled with parallelization, or wished for a simpler way to create and manage DAG pipelines, `pipefunc` is here to help.\n\n**What My Project Does:**\n\n`pipefunc` empowers you to easily construct **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** pipelines in Python. It handles:\n\n1. **Automatic Dependency Resolution:**  `pipefunc` automatically determines the correct execution order of your functions, eliminating manual dependency management.\n2. **Lightning-Fast Execution:** With minimal overhead (around **10 µs per function call**), `pipefunc` ensures your pipelines run super fast.\n3. **Effortless Parallelization:** `pipefunc` automatically parallelizes independent tasks, whether on your local machine or a SLURM cluster. It supports any `concurrent.futures.Executor`!\n4. **Intuitive Visualization:** Generate interactive graphs to visualize your pipeline's structure and understand data flow.\n5. **Simplified Parameter Sweeps:**  `pipefunc`'s `mapspec` feature lets you easily define and run N-dimensional parameter sweeps, which is perfect for scientific computing, simulations, and hyperparameter tuning.\n6. **Resource Profiling:** Gain insights into your pipeline's performance with detailed CPU, memory, and timing reports.\n7. **Caching:** Avoid redundant computations with multiple caching backends.\n8. **Type Annotation Validation:** Ensures type consistency across your pipeline to catch errors early.\n9. **Error Handling:** Includes an `ErrorSnapshot` feature to capture detailed information about errors, making debugging easier.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\n`pipefunc` is ideal for:\n\n*   **Scientific Computing:** Streamline simulations, data analysis, and complex computational workflows.\n*   **Machine Learning:** Build robust and reproducible ML pipelines, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.\n*   **Data Engineering:** Create efficient ETL processes with automatic dependency management and parallel execution.\n*   **HPC:** Run `pipefunc` on a SLURM cluster with minimal changes to your code.\n*   **Anyone** working with interconnected functions who wants to improve code organization, performance, and maintainability.\n\n`pipefunc` is designed to be flexible (great tool for prototyping and experimentation) and easy to adopt!\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*  **vs. Hamilton:** Hamilton also compiles Python functions into\nDAGs, but it centers on column-level DataFrame engineering, ships modifiers like @with_columns/@extract_columns, and offers built-in data/schema validation plus an optional UI for lineage and observability; pipefunc leans toward low-overhead scientific/HPC pipelines, executor-agnostic parallelism, and N-D sweeps via mapspecs.\n*   **vs. Dask:** `pipefunc` offers a higher-level, more declarative way to define pipelines. It automatically manages task scheduling and execution based on your function definitions and `mapspec`s, without requiring you to write explicit parallel code.\n*   **vs. Luigi/Airflow/Prefect/Kedro:** While those tools excel at ETL and event-driven workflows, `pipefunc` focuses on scientific computing, simulations, and computational workflows where fine-grained control over execution and resource allocation is crucial. Also, it's way easier to setup and develop with, with minimal dependencies!\n*   **vs. Pandas:** You can easily combine `pipefunc` with `Pandas`! Use `pipefunc` to manage the execution of `Pandas` operations and parallelize your data processing pipelines. But it also works well with `Polars`, `Xarray`, and other libraries!\n*   **vs. Joblib:** `pipefunc` offers several advantages over `Joblib`. `pipefunc` automatically determines the execution order of your functions, generates interactive visualizations of your pipeline, profiles resource usage, and supports multiple caching backends. Also, `pipefunc` allows you to specify the mapping between inputs and outputs using `mapspec`s, which enables complex map-reduce operations.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**Simple Example:**\n\n```python\nfrom pipefunc import pipefunc, Pipeline\n\n@pipefunc(output_name=\"c\")\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n@pipefunc(output_name=\"d\")\ndef multiply(b, c):\n    return b * c\n\npipeline = Pipeline([add, multiply])\nresult = pipeline(\"d\", a=2, b=3)  # Automatically executes 'add' first\nprint(result)  # Output: 15\n\npipeline.visualize() # Visualize the pipeline\n```\n\n**Parallel Example with `mapspec`:**\n\nParallelizes for all combinations of inputs `a` and `b` automatically!\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pipefunc import pipefunc, Pipeline\nfrom pipefunc.map import load_outputs\n\n@pipefunc(output_name=\"c\", mapspec=\"a[i], b[j] -&gt; c[i, j]\")\ndef f(a: int, b: int):\n    return a + b\n\n@pipefunc(output_name=\"mean\") # no mapspec, so receives 2D `c[:, :]`\ndef g(c: np.ndarray):\n    return np.mean(c)\n\npipeline = Pipeline([f, g])\ninputs = {\"a\": [1, 2, 3], \"b\": [4, 5, 6]}\nresult_dict = pipeline.map(inputs, run_folder=\"my_run_folder\", parallel=True)\nresult = load_outputs(\"mean\", run_folder=\"my_run_folder\") # can load now too\nprint(result)  # Output: 7.0\n```\n\n**Getting Started:**\n\n*   **Docs:** [https://pipefunc.readthedocs.io/](https://pipefunc.readthedocs.io/)\n*   **Source:** [https://github.com/pipefunc/pipefunc](https://github.com/pipefunc/pipefunc)\n\nI'm exctited to hear your feedback and answer any questions you have. Give `pipefunc` a try and let me know how it can improve your workflows!\n",

    "title": "SPDL - Scalable and Performant Data Loading",
    "content": "Hi Python community,\n\nInspired by recent showcases on pipeline libraries ([Pipevine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1o2n119/ergonomic_concurrency/), [pipefunc](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1o3323m/pipefunc_build_lightningfast_pipelines_with/)), I’d like to share my project: **SPDL (Scalable and Performant Data Loading)**. \n\n# What My Project Does\n\nSPDL is designed to address the data loading bottleneck in machine learning (ML) and AI training pipelines. You break down data loading into discrete tasks with different constraints (network, CPU, GPU transfer etc) and construct a pipeline, and SPDL executes them efficiently. It features a task execution engine (pipeline abstraction) built on asyncio, alongside an independent I/O module for media processing. \n\n# Resources:\n\n* **Repo:** [https://github.com/facebookresearch/spdl](https://github.com/facebookresearch/spdl)\n* **Documentation:** [SPDL Docs](https://facebookresearch.github.io/spdl/main/)\n* **PyPI:**\n   * Install with `pip install spdl`\n      * [spdl-core](https://pypi.org/project/spdl-core/) (no dependency)\n      * [spdl-io](https://pypi.org/project/spdl-io/) (requires NumPy, and optionally PyTorch / Numba / Jax) \n* **arXiv:** [2504.20067](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20067)\n\n# Target Audience\n\nML practitioners whose focus is model training rather than software engineering. It is production-ready.\n\n# Core Principles\n\n* **High Throughput &amp; Efficiency:** SPDL maximizes data loading speed and minimizes CPU/memory overhead to keep GPUs busy.\n* **Flexibility:** The pipeline abstraction is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the structure to their environment, data, and requirements.\n* **Observability:** SPDL provides runtime statistics for each pipeline component, helping users identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.\n* **Intuitive Construction:** Pipelines are easy to build and reason about, with clear separation of stages and bounding factors.\n\n# Architecture Overview\n\n* **Pipeline Abstraction:** With SPDL, you break down data loading into discrete tasks with different constraints (network, CPU, GPU transfer etc) and construct a pipeline that executes each task concurrently.\n* **Multi-threading &amp; Multi-processing:** SPDL uses multi-threading by default for parallelism, with optional multi-processing for workloads that benefit from process isolation. In production, we’ve successfully used multi-threading with Python 3.10 by composing functions that release the GIL. Support for InterpreterPoolExecutor in Python 3.14 is planned.\n* **Async Event Loop:** The task execution engine is built on an async event loop, supporting both async and regular functions.\n* **Media I/O Module:** Includes a high-performance I/O module for audio, video, and image processing, designed from scratch for maximum throughput. It also supports loading NumPy array fast from memory.\n* **Non-invasive:** SPDL orchestrates the execution of given functions, and the only requirement for the function is that it is univariate function. No requirements to change your algorithms/business logic to pipelining it with SPDL.\n\n# Monitoring &amp; Optimization\n\nSPDL exports detailed runtime statistics for each pipeline stage, making it easy to monitor throughput, resource usage, and identify bottlenecks. For more on production bottleneck analysis, see the [Optimization Guide](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffacebookresearch.github.io%2Fspdl%2Fmain%2Foptimization_guide%2Fanalysis.html&amp;h=AT3Hi60CVKm_FzR6YfXpfbCm4kDWAVz5144UjUlM7PbqiIaM-7yzNqESVRJqwnHieAIYd_BoPn5GkG8-t66ZfmbEbyS3hyMsNXu-CqwngZ5FVw1ZdbXwhRVG1xYKrE4d81n7m4rYPBbi2XQBwy898DT9nWE).\n\n# Comparison\n\n* Unlike previously shared projects, the feature set is more specific to ML efficiency. (though the pipeline abstraction is generic, and library is agnostic to ML framework)\n* Supports single chain pipelining with different concurrency. Merging pipeline is also supported but not branching or general graph structure.",

And if you know any other places where people might be interested in this tool, please let me know.\n\n**What My Project Does:**\n\nIt is a library for creating and editing EPUB documents according to the EPUB3 specification. Example from the [documentation](https://epub-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#basic-usage):\n\n    from epublib import EPUB\n    \n    with EPUB(\"book.epub\") as book:\n        book.metadata.title = \"New title\"\n    \n        for doc in book.documents:\n            new_script = doc.soup.new_tag(\"script\", attrs={\"src\": \"../Misc/myscript.js\"})\n            doc.soup.head.append(new_script)\n    \n            new_heading = doc.soup.new_tag(\"h1\", string=\"New heading\")\n            doc.soup.body.insert(0, new_heading)\n    \n        book.update_manifest_properties()\n        book.write(\"book-modified.epub\")\n\nSee the [usage section ](https://epub-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#basic-usage)of the documentation for a more usage examples.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nPeople working with publishing digital books using the EPUB format.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nThere is already an active python library called [EbookLib](https://pypi.org/project/EbookLib/) for handling EPUBs. A few things EPUBLib does differently:\n\n1. Handles the EPUB non-intrusively, e.g. won't regenerate the package document/metadata before writing, can edit toc without recreating the entire navigation document;\n2. Built-in XML parsing with BeautifulSoup;\n3. Extra features: rename files, remove files, spine reordering etc;\n4. Use nomenclature from the specification when possible (e.g. \"resource\" instead of \"item\").\n\n",

[https://github.com/GetStream/Vision-Agents](https://github.com/GetStream/Vision-Agents)\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nThe idea is that it makes it super simple to build vision agents, combining fast models like Yolo with Gemini/Openai realtime. We're going for low latency &amp; a completely open sdk. So you can use any vision model or video edge network. \n\nHere's an example of running live video through Yolo and then passing it to Gemini\n\n    agent = Agent(\n        edge=getstream.Edge(),\n        agent_user=agent_user,\n        instructions=\"Read @golf_coach.md\",\n        llm=openai.Realtime(fps=10),\n        #llm=gemini.Realtime(fps=1), # Careful with FPS can get expensive\n        processors=[ultralytics.YOLOPoseProcessor(model_path=\"yolo11n-pose.pt\")],\n    )\n\n**Target Audience** \n\nVision AI is like chatgpt in 2022. It's really fun to see how it works and what's possible. Anything from live coaching, to sports, to physical therapy, robotics, drones etc. But it's not production quality yet. Gemini and OpenAI both hallucinate a ton for vision AI. It seems close to being viable though, especially fun to have it describe your surroundings etc.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nSimilar to Livekit Agents (livekit specific) and Pipecat (daily). We're going for open to all edge networks, low latency and with a focus on vision AI (voice works, but we're focused on live video)\n\nThis has been fun to work on with the team, finally at 0.1 :)\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "**What Fiatlight Does**\n\n[Fiatlight](https://pthom.github.io/fiatlight_doc) is a Python toolkit that lets you build interactive graphical applications by providing an *automatic user interface* for functions and dataclasses. It is published under the MIT license.\n\nYou may think of Fiatlight as *\"ComfyUI for any type of data and functions\"*: easy visual and interactive pipelines for any domain of interest. You do not have to write any UI code, and you can connect multiple functions to build workflows instantly: the outputs flow from one function to the next\n\nUsers can then adjust every parameter of the functions and save/reload their work. \n\nFiatlight is built on top of Dear ImGui Bundle. It is very fast, and can provide feedback in real-time (at 120 FPS!). Since Dear ImGui Bundle is available via Pyodide, Fiatlight applications can be used locally or deployed as static web pages, without any server-side component.\n\nAs a prototyping tool, fiatlight does *not* provide full design control over the UI. It does however provide advanced viewer for many data types (standard python types, images, files, dataframes, matplotlib figures,  etc.), and is easily extensible.\n \n*Links:*\n- [Video tutorials](https://pthom.github.io/fiatlight_doc/flgt/video_tutorials.html)\n- [Documentation](https://pthom.github.io/fiatlight_doc)\n- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pthom/fiatlight)\n\n\n**Target Audience**\n\n* Hobbyists wanting to create interactive applications quickly\n* Educators and instructors needing interactive tools for teaching programming or algorithms\n* Researchers who need shareable demos or visualizations of their work\n* Developers who want to fine tune their algorithms, with visual feedback\n* Library authors who want to showcase or demonstrate how to use and compose their functions\n* Data scientists and analysts wanting instant GUI dashboards for exploring data\n\n\n**Comparison**\n\n* Broader scope than ComfyUI\n* Often faster than streamlit or gradio (runs locally or serverless on a static web page)\n* LabVIEW is famous for data acquisition, hardware integration, and quick GUI building, but is expensive and highly niche/proprietary\n* Unreal Blueprints are widely used for visual scripting in games and rapid prototyping, but tightly coupled to Unreal Engine and less suitable for general Python/data workflows\n\n**Example**\n\nThe example below showcases a simple pipeline where the user edits the input float value, and automatically sees the output of each function. Widgets for each parameter are generated according to type and customized with attributes.\n\n```python\n# Our functions\ndef float_source(x: float = 1.0) -&gt; float:\n    return x\ndef double(x: float = 1.0) -&gt; float:\n    return 2 * x\n\n# Below, our GUI, where the user can edit the input for float_source, and see the output of both functions\n\nimport fiatlight as fl\n# Set range for slider\nfl.add_fiat_attributes(float_source, x__edit_type=\"slider\", x__range=(0.0, 10.0))  \n\n# Display a GUI for the composition of these two functions\nfl.run([float_source, double])  \n```\n",

It takes your Pydantic models and automatically generates:\n\n* The ORM models with relationships\n* The migrations\n* FastAPI REST endpoints (CRUD - including batch, with relationship navigation and field specifiers)\n* GraphQL schema via Strawberry (including nested relationships)\n* MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration\n* SDK for other projects\n* Pytest tests for all of the above\n* Coming Soon: **External API federation** from third-party APIs directly into your models (including **into the GQL schema**) - [early preview screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/Cem1FOT)\n\n# Target Audience\n\nAnyone who's also tired of writing the same thing 4 different ways and wants to ship ASAP.\n\n# Comparison\n\nMost tools solve one piece of this problem:\n\n* `SQLModel` generates SQLAlchemy models from Pydantic but doesn't handle REST/GraphQL/tests\n* `Strawberry/Graphene Extensions` generate GraphQL schemas but require separate REST endpoints and ORM definitions\n* `FastAPI-utils/FastAPI-CRUD` generate REST endpoints but require manual GraphQL and testing setup\n* `Hasura/PostGraphile` auto-generate GraphQL from databases but aren't Python-native and don't integrate with your existing Pydantic models\n\nThis framework generates all of it - ORM, REST, GraphQL, SDK, and tests - from a single Pydantic definition. The API federation feature also lets you integrate external APIs (Stripe, etc.) directly into your generated GraphQL schema, which most alternatives can't do.\n\n# Links\n\nDocumentation available on GitHub and well-organized through Obsidian after cloning: [https://github.com/JamesonRGrieve/ServerFramework](https://github.com/JamesonRGrieve/ServerFramework)\n\nI also built a NextJS companion front end that's designed to be similarly extensible.\n\n[https://github.com/JamesonRGrieve/ClientFramework](https://github.com/JamesonRGrieve/ClientFramework)\n\nFeedback and contributions welcome!",

    "content": "\n\nAnnouncing the release of aiar, a command-line utility for packaging/extracting file collections via a single archive.\n\nThe primary use case is to simplify sending and receiving multi-file projects in text-only environments, particularly when interacting with LLMs. LLMs will find it particularly easy to create these files since there is no need to escape any characters. In particular, you don’t even need the aiar tool if you trust your LLM to generate the self-extracting script for you.\n\n### **Key Features**\n\n* **Self-Contained:** Archives contain both the extraction logic and data. No external tools like zip or tar are required to unpack.  \n* **Multi-Format Output:** Generate self-extracting archives as Bash, Python, Node.js, or PowerShell scripts.  \n* **LLM-Centric Design:** Includes a data-only \"bare\" (.aiar) format, which is a simple text specification for LLMs to generate without writing any code.  (Not that LLMs are able to easily create bash aiar files.)  \n* **Extracting languages supported**: python, bash/zsh, nodejs and powershell and of course, no language “.aiar” bare format which does not include the extraction code. Bare format files (as well as all the language specific archive formats) can be extracted using the aiar tool.\n\n### **Usage**\n\n**Installation:**\n\npip install aiar\n\n**Creating an Archive:**\n\n\\# Create a self-extracting scripts  \naiar create \\-o archive.py my\\_stuff/  \\# python\n\naiar create \\-o archive.bash my\\_stuff/ \\# bash or zsh\n\naiar create \\-o archive.ps1 my\\_stuff/ \\# powershell\n\n**Extracting an Archive using the built in script:**\n\npython archive.py \\# python\n\nbash archive.bash\n\npowershell archive.ps1\n\n\\# Or, extract any format (including bare) with the tool  \naiar extract archive.py\n\nFeedback and contributions are welcome.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* **PyPI:** [https://pypi.org/project/aiar/](https://pypi.org/project/aiar/)  \n* **GitHub:** [https://github.com/owebeeone/aiar](https://github.com/owebeeone/aiar)",

For example:\n\n\n    @dataclass\n    class Counter:\n        count: Field[int] = Field(-1)\n\n        @ count &gt;= 0\n        async def loop(self, field, old, new):\n                self.count += 1\n\n\n\nWhen count is changed to non negative number it will start counting. Type annotations and some execution management code has been removed. For working examples see src/test/examples directory.\n\nThe code has liberal todos in it to expand the functionality, but the core of it is stable, so I thought it was time to release it.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts, or feel free to ask questions about how it works or why I did things a certain way. Thanks!\n\nThe post that got me thinking about this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nmta0f/i\\_built\\_a\\_full\\_programming\\_language\\_interpreter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nmta0f/i_built_a_full_programming_language_interpreter/)",

    "content": "I wanted to share a small Python library I havee been working on that might help with managing ML experiment configurations.\n\nJump here directly to the repository: [https://github.com/florianmahner/tomlparse](https://github.com/florianmahner/tomlparse)\n\n**What is it?**\n\ntomlparse is a lightweight wrapper around Python's argparse that lets you use TOML files for configuration management while keeping all the benefits of argparse. It is designed to make hyperparameter management less painful for larger projects.\n\n**Why TOML?**\n\nIf you've been using YAML or JSON for configs, TOML offers some nice advantages:\n\n* Native support for dates, floats, integers, booleans, and arrays\n* Clear, readable syntax without significant whitespace issues\n* Official Python standard library support (tomllib in Python 3.11+)\n* Comments that actually stay comments\n\n**Key Features**\n\nThe library adds minimal overhead to your existing argparse workflow:\n\n    import tomlparse\n    \n    parser = tomlparse.ArgumentParser()\n    parser.add_argument(\"--foo\", type=int, default=0)\n    parser.add_argument(\"--bar\", type=str, default=\"\")\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\nThen run with:\n\n    python experiment.py --config \"example.toml\"\n\n**What I find useful:**\n\n1. **Table support** \\- Organize configs into sections and switch between them easily\n2. **Clear override hierarchy** \\- CLI args &gt; TOML table values &gt; TOML root values &gt; defaults\n3. **Easy experiment tracking** \\- Keep different TOML files for different experiment runs\n\n**Example use case with tables:**\n\n    # This is a TOML File\n    # Parameters without a preceding [] are not part of a table (called root-table)\n    foo = 10\n    bar = \"hello\"\n    \n    # These arguments are part of the table [general]\n    [general]\n    foo = 20\n    \n    # These arguments are part of the table [root]\n    [root]\n    bar = \"hey\"\n\nYou can then specify which table to use:\n\n    python experiment.py --config \"example.toml\" --table \"general\"\n    # Returns: {\"foo\": 20, \"bar\": \"hello\"}\n    \n    python experiment.py --config \"example.toml\" --table \"general\" --root-table \"root\"\n    # Returns: {\"foo\": 20, \"bar\": \"hey\"}\n\nAnd you can always override from the command line:\n\n    python experiment.py --config \"example.toml\" --table \"general\" --foo 100\n\n**Install:**\n\n    pip install tomlparse\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/florianmahner/tomlparse](https://github.com/florianmahner/tomlparse)\n\nWould love to hear thoughts or feedback if anyone tries it out! It has been useful for my own work, but I am sure there are edge cases I haven't considered.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is a personal project, not affiliated with any organization.*",

    "title": "Use uv with Python 3.14 and IIS sites",
    "content": "After the upgrade to Python 3.14, there's no longer the concept of a \"system-wide\" Python. Therefore, when you create a virtual environment, the hardlinks (if they are really hardlinks) point to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Python\\pythoncore-3.14-64\\python.exe`. The problem is that if you have a virtual environment for an IIS website, e.g. spanandeggs.example.com, this will by default run with the virtual user IISAPPPOOL\\spamandeggs.example.com. And that user most certainly doesn't have access to your personal `%LOCALAPPDATA%` directory. So, if you try to run the site, you'll get this error:\n\n`did not find executable at '«%LOCALAPPDATA%»\\Python\\pythoncore-3.14-64\\python.exe': Access is denied.`\n\nTo make this work I've had to:\n\n1. Download python to a separate directory (`uv python install 3.14 --install-dir C:\\python\\`)\n2. Sync the virtual environment with the new Python version: `uv sync --upgrade --python C:\\Python\\cpython-3.14.0-windows-x86_64-none\\`)\n\nFor completeness, where's an example web.config to make a site run natively under IIS (this assumes there's an app.py).

Currently, PyArrow often becomes the last major dependency to support new Python versions, with support arriving about a month after Python's stable release, which creates a bottleneck for the broader data engineering ecosystem.\n\nThe proposal suggests moving Arrow's feature freeze from early October to early August, shortly after Python's ABI-stable release candidate drops in late July, which would flip the timeline so PyArrow wheels are available around a month before Python's stable release rather than after.\n\n[https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/47700](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/47700)",

    "content": "  \n**What My Project Does:** Push Python to 20k req/sec.\n\n**Target Audience**: People who need to make a ton of requests.\n\n**Comparison**: Previous articles I found ranged from 50-500 requests/sec with python, figured i'd give an update to where things are at now.\n\nI wanted to share a personal project exploring the limits of Python for high-throughput network I/O. My clients would always say \"lol no python, only go\", so I wanted to see what was actually possible.\n\nAfter a lot of tuning, I managed to get a stable **\\~20,000 requests/second** from a single client machine.\n\nThe code itself is based on `asyncio` and a library called `rnet`, which is a Python wrapper for the high-performance Rust library `wreq`. This lets me get the developer-friendly syntax of Python with the raw speed of Rust for the actual networking.\n\nThe most interesting part wasn't the code, but the OS tuning. The default kernel settings on Linux are nowhere near ready for this kind of load. The application would fail instantly without these changes.\n\nHere are the most critical settings I had to change on both the client and server:\n\n* Increased Max File Descriptors: Every socket is a file. The default limit of 1024 is the first thing you'll hit.ulimit -n 65536\n* Expanded Ephemeral Port Range: The client needs a large pool of ports to make outgoing connections from.net.ipv4.ip\\_local\\_port\\_range = 1024 65535\n* Increased Connection Backlog: The server needs a bigger queue to hold incoming connections before they are accepted. The default is tiny.net.core.somaxconn = 65535\n* Enabled TIME\\_WAIT Reuse: This is huge. It allows the kernel to quickly reuse sockets that are in a TIME\\_WAIT state, which is essential when you're opening/closing thousands of connections per second.net.ipv4.tcp\\_tw\\_reuse = 1\n\nI've open-sourced the entire test setup, including the client code, a simple server, and the full tuning scripts for both machines. You can find it all here if you want to replicate it or just look at the code:\n\n**GitHub Repo:** [**https://github.com/lafftar/requestSpeedTest**](https://github.com/lafftar/requestSpeedTest)\n\nOn an 8-core machine, this setup hit \\~15k req/s, and it scaled to \\~20k req/s on a 32-core machine. Interestingly, the CPU was never fully maxed out, so the bottleneck likely lies somewhere else in the stack.\n\nI'll be hanging out in the comments to answer any questions. Let me know what you think!\n\n**Blog Post (I go in a little more detail)**: [https://tjaycodes.com/pushing-python-to-20000-requests-second/](https://tjaycodes.com/pushing-python-to-20000-requests-second/)",

    "title": "Tired of Messy WebSockets? I Built Chanx to End the If/Else Hell in Real-Time Python App",
    "content": "After 3 years of building AI agents and real-time applications across Django and FastAPI, I kept hitting the same wall: WebSocket development was a mess of if/else chains, manual validation, and zero documentation. When working with FastAPI, I'd wish for a powerful WebSocket framework that could match the elegance of its REST API development. To solve this once and for all, I built Chanx – the WebSocket toolkit I wish existed from day one.\n\n## What My Project Does\n\n## The Pain Point Every Python Developer Knows\n\nBuilding WebSocket apps in Python is a nightmare we all share:\n\n```python\n# The usual FastAPI WebSocket mess\n@app.websocket(\"/ws\")\nasync def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):\n    await websocket.accept()\n    while True:\n        data = await websocket.receive_json()\n        action = data.get(\"action\")\n        if action == \"echo\":\n            await websocket.send_json({\"action\": \"echo_response\", \"payload\": data.get(\"payload\")})\n        elif action == \"ping\":\n            await websocket.send_json({\"action\": \"pong\", \"payload\": None})\n        elif action == \"join_room\":\n            # Manual room handling...\n        # ... 20 more elif statements\n```\n\nPlus manual validation, zero documentation, and trying to send events from Django views or FastAPI endpoints to WebSocket clients? Pure pain.\n\n**Chanx eliminates all of this** with decorator automation that works consistently across frameworks.\n\n## How Chanx Transforms Your Code\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Literal\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom chanx.core.decorators import ws_handler, event_handler, channel\nfrom chanx.core.websocket import AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer\nfrom chanx.messages.base import BaseMessage\n\n# Define your message types (action-based routing)\nclass EchoPayload(BaseModel):\n    message: str\n\nclass NotificationPayload(BaseModel):\n    alert: str\n    level: str = \"info\"\n\n# Client Messages\nclass EchoMessage(BaseMessage):\n    action: Literal[\"echo\"] = \"echo\"\n    payload: EchoPayload\n\n# Server Messages\nclass EchoResponseMessage(BaseMessage):\n    action: Literal[\"echo_response\"] = \"echo_response\"\n    payload: EchoPayload\n\nclass NotificationMessage(BaseMessage):\n    action: Literal[\"notification\"] = \"notification\"\n    payload: NotificationPayload\n\n# Events (for server-side broadcasting)\nclass SystemNotifyEvent(BaseMessage):\n    action: Literal[\"system_notify\"] = \"system_notify\"\n    payload: NotificationPayload\n\n@channel(name=\"chat\", description=\"Real-time chat API\")\nclass ChatConsumer(AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer):\n    @ws_handler(summary=\"Handle echo messages\", output_type=EchoResponseMessage)\n    async def handle_echo(self, message: EchoMessage) -&gt; None:\n        await self.send_message(EchoResponseMessage(payload=message.payload))\n\n    @event_handler(output_type=NotificationMessage)\n    async def handle_system_notify(self, event: SystemNotifyEvent) -&gt; NotificationMessage:\n        return NotificationMessage(payload=event.payload)\n```\n\n**Key features:**\n- 🎯 **Decorator-based routing** - No more if/else chains\n- 📚 **Auto AsyncAPI docs** - Generate comprehensive WebSocket API documentation\n- 🔒 **Type safety** - Full mypy/pyright support with Pydantic validation\n- 🌐 **Multi-framework** - Django Channels, FastAPI, any ASGI framework\n- 📡 **Event broadcasting** - Send events from HTTP views, background tasks, anywhere\n- 🧪 **Enhanced testing** - Framework-specific testing utilities\n\n## Target Audience\n\n**Chanx is production-ready** and designed for:\n- Python developers building real-time features (chat, notifications, live updates)\n- Django teams wanting to eliminate WebSocket boilerplate\n- FastAPI projects needing robust WebSocket capabilities\n- Full-stack applications requiring seamless HTTP ↔ WebSocket event broadcasting\n- Type-safety advocates who want comprehensive IDE support for WebSocket development\n- API-first teams needing automatic AsyncAPI documentation\n\nBuilt from 3+ years of experience developing AI chat applications, real-time voice recording systems, and live notification platforms - solving every pain point I encountered along the way.\n\n## Comparison\n\n**vs Raw Django Channels/FastAPI WebSockets:**\n- ❌ Manual if/else routing → ✅ Automatic decorator-based routing\n- ❌ Manual validation → ✅ Automatic Pydantic validation\n- ❌ No documentation → ✅ Auto-generated AsyncAPI 3.0 specs\n- ❌ Complex event sending → ✅ Simple broadcasting from anywhere\n\n**vs Broadcaster:**\n- Broadcaster is just pub/sub messaging\n- Chanx provides complete WebSocket consumer framework with routing, validation, docs\n\n**vs FastStream:**\n- FastStream focuses on message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.) for async messaging\n- Chanx focuses on real-time WebSocket applications with decorator-based routing, auto-validation, and seamless HTTP integration\n- Different use cases: FastStream for distributed systems, Chanx for interactive real-time features\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Django Channels\npip install \"chanx[channels]\"  # Includes Django, DRF, Channels Redis\n\n# FastAPI\npip install \"chanx[fast_channels]\"  # Includes FastAPI, fast-channels\n\n# Any ASGI framework\npip install chanx  # Core only\n```\n\n## Real-World Usage\n\nSend events from anywhere in your application:\n\n```python\n# From FastAPI endpoint\n@app.post(\"/api/posts\")\nasync def create_post(post_data: PostCreate):\n    post = await create_post_logic(post_data)\n\n    # Instantly notify WebSocket clients\n    await ChatConsumer.broadcast_event(\n        NewPostEvent(payload={\"title\": post.title}),\n        groups=[\"feed_updates\"]\n    )\n    return {\"status\": \"created\"}\n\n# From Django views, Celery tasks, management scripts\nChatConsumer.broadcast_event_sync(\n    NotificationEvent(payload={\"alert\": \"System maintenance\"}),\n    groups=[\"admin_users\"]\n)\n```\n\n**Links:**\n- 🔗 **GitHub:** https://github.com/huynguyengl99/chanx\n- 📦 **PyPI:** https://pypi.org/project/chanx/\n- 📖 **Documentation:** https://chanx.readthedocs.io/\n- 🚀 **Django Examples:** https://chanx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/django.html\n- ⚡ **FastAPI Examples:** https://chanx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/fastapi.html\n\nGive it a try in your next project and let me know what you think!

    "content": "**What does my project does**: Otary is an open-source Python library dedicated to image manipulation and 2D geometry processing. It gets even smarter with the addition of 17 binarization methods now available! [Jump to the documentation straight away](https://alexandrepoupeau.com/otary/api/image/transformers/thresholding/).\n\n**Target Audience**: Python developers or researchers focused on image processing and computer vision tasks.\n\n**Comparison**: you could actually use Numpy, OpenCV directly. They are used behind the scene by Otary.\n\nOtary now includes 17 binarization methods, designed to make experimentation both simple for beginners and powerful for advanced users.\n\n🔹 **5 basic methods**: easily accessible for quick and efficient use: simple, otsu, adaptive, bradley, and sauvola.\n\nThese methods are the most classic and effective, perfect for new users and for 90% of practical cases.\n\n🔹 **12 advanced methods**: for users who want to explore, compare, and understand more sophisticated approaches.\n\nThey are intended for image processing specialists and researchers who want to experiment with new ideas.\n\n📖 The documentation presents a summary table of the 17 methods, classified by year of publication and accompanied by links to the original scientific articles.\n\n✨ My revelation: FAIR binarization.\n\nFAIR stands for “Fast Algorithm for document Image Restoration” and it has completely changed the way I approach binarization. Rather than binarizing the entire image, it:\n\n1. First detects edge pixels with a custom Canny edge detector\n2. Applies a clustering algorithm to small windows centered around the edge pixels.\n3. Performs post-processing to complete the total binarization of the image\n\nThis is the approach I found most innovative among all those I have explored and implemented. It uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to identify text pixels versus background pixels by assuming a Gaussian mixture distribution: it's simply brilliant!\n\n💬 I sincerely hope that this update will make the work of developers, engineers, and researchers who manipulate images easier and inspire new explorations.\n\n🙏 I would also like to encourage everyone to contribute, add new binarization methods, improve existing ones, or even invent new approaches.\n\nIf you spot an error or have ideas for improving Otary, your contributions are welcome, that's the spirit of open source.\n\n**Github link**: [https://github.com/poupeaua/otary](https://github.com/poupeaua/otary)",

    "content": "I work professionally with a bunch of languages, as an integration engineer. Python is a fairly common one and sometimes I need to add just the right API I need for my integration work to a project. I don't compromise on anything that helps me catch bugs before runtime, so I always have the strictest type checking enabled, which however... when it comes to Python, drives me insane. Once one starts building complex applications, `# type: ignore` becomes your best friend, because handling e.g. a GeoPandas type error would require one hour, even though runtime-wise it has no repercussions whatsoever.\n\nI have worked with other type hinting systems, namely Erlang's, Elixir's and PHP's and I must say, none of them has given me the headaches that Python's regularly gives me. So, I was wondering if there is something inherent to Python that makes type hints a nightmare? Is the tooling \"bad\"? What is the issue exactly?",

    "content": "We're happy to announce the **third major release of NiceGUI**.\n\n[NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io) is a powerful yet simple-to-use UI framework to build applications, dashboards, and tools that run in the browser. You write Python; NiceGUI builds the frontend and handles the browser plumbing. It's great for modern web apps, internal tools, data science apps, robotics interfaces, and embedded/edge UIs — anywhere you want a polished web interface without frontend framework complexity.\n\nWe recently discussed NiceGUI on the Talk Python To Me podcast — [watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74UXonJfl6o).\n\n# Highlights\n\n* **Single-Page Apps** with `ui.run(root=...)` \\+ [`ui.sub_pages`](https://nicegui.io/documentation/sub_pages/)\n* New **script mode** for small and tight Python scripts (see below).\n* Lightweight [**Event system**](https://nicegui.io/documentation/event) to connect short‑lived UIs with long‑lived Python services.\n* **Observables**: modify props/classes/style and the UI updates automatically.\n* **Tables / AG Grid**: update live via `table.rows/columns` or `aggrid.options`.\n* **Simplified pytest** [setup](https://nicegui.io/documentation/section_testing) and improved [`user` fixture](https://nicegui.io/documentation/user) for fast UI tests.\n* **Tailwind 4** support.\n\nFull notes &amp; migration: [3.0.0 release](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/releases/tag/v3.0.0)\n\n# Minimal examples\n\n**Script mode**\n\n    from nicegui import ui\n    \n    ui.label('Hello, !')\n    ui.button('Click me', on_click=lambda: ui.notify('NiceGUI 3.0'))\n    \n    ui.run()\n\nRun the file; your browser will show the app at `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n**Single‑Page App (SPA)**\n\n    from nicegui import ui\n    \n    ui.link.default_classes('no-underline')\n    \n    def root():\n        with ui.header().classes('bg-gray-100'):\n            ui.link('Home', '/')\n            ui.link('About', '/about')\n        ui.sub_pages({\n            '/': main,\n            '/about': about,\n        })\n    \n    def main():\n        ui.label('Main page')\n    \n    def about():\n        ui.label('About page')\n    \n    ui.run(root)\n\nWhen started, every visit to [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) executes `root` and shows a header with links to the `main` and `about` pages.\n\n# Why it matters\n\n* **Build UI in the backend**: one codebase/language with direct access to domain state and services. Fewer moving parts and tighter security boundaries.\n* **Async by default**: efficient I/O, WebSockets, and streaming keep UIs responsive under load.\n* **FastAPI under the hood**: REST + UI in one codebase, fully typed, and proven middleware/auth.\n* **Tailwind utilities + Quasar components**: consistent, responsive styling, and polished widgets without frontend setup.\n* **General‑purpose apps**: explicit routing, Pythonic APIs, and intuitive server‑side state handling.\n\n# Get started\n\n* Install: `pip install nicegui`\n* Documentation &amp; Quickstart: [nicegui.io](https://nicegui.io) (built with NiceGUI itself)\n* 3.0 release notes &amp; migration: [3.0.0 release](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/releases/tag/v3.0.0)\n* License: MIT. Python 3.9+.\n\nIf you build something neat, share a screenshot or repo. We’d love to see it!",

    "title": "Instrument AI PDF Splitter – Split full orchestral PDFs into per-instrument parts",
    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been building a small open-source Python project called Instrument AI PDF Splitter. It takes massive orchestra PDFs (with all instruments in one file) and automatically splits them into clean PDFs for each part.\n\n\n---\n\nWhat My Project Does\n\nDetects instrument names, voice numbers (like “Trumpet 2” or “Violin I”), and their start/end pages automatically using OpenAI.\n\nWorks with both scanned and digital sheet music PDFs.\n\nSaves per-instrument PDFs in a neat folder and outputs structured JSON metadata.\n\nAvoids re-uploading the same file by hashing it.\n\nAllows custom instrument lists if needed.\n\nCan be integrated into orchestral score management software — I’m currently developing a project for managing full digital orchestral scores, which this tool will complement.\n\n\n\n---\n\nTarget Audience\n\nOrchestras, ensembles, and developers building tools for digital music management.\n\nAnyone who needs to extract individual parts from combined sheet music PDFs.\n\nNot a full score management solution on its own, but a practical building block for such workflows.\n\n\n\n---\n\nComparison\nUnlike existing PDF splitters or music OCR tools, this project:\n\nAutomatically detects instruments and voice numbers instead of requiring manual input.\n\nHandles both scanned and digital PDFs.\n\nProduces ready-to-use per-instrument PDFs plus structured JSON metadata.\n\nIs lightweight, open-source, and easy to integrate into larger orchestral score management systems.\n\n\n\n---\n\nInstall\n\n`pip install instrumentaipdfsplitter`\n\nRequires Python 3.10+ and an OpenAI API key.\n\n\n---\n\nQuick example\n\n```python\nfrom instrumentaipdfsplitter import InstrumentAiPdfSplitter\n\nsplitter = InstrumentAiPdfSplitter(api_key=\"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n\n# Analyze the score\ndata = splitter.analyse(\"path/to/score.pdf\")\n\n# Split it into instrument parts\nresults = splitter.split_pdf(\"path/to/score.pdf\")\n```\n\n---\n\n🔗 [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/instrumentaipdfsplitter/)\n🔗 [GitHub](https://github.com/DiscoveryFox/InstrumentAiPdfSplitter)\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback! Hopefully this makes splitting full scores easier and can help feed into orchestral score management systems — stay tuned, I’ll be posting about that project in a few days.",

Now I will briefly describe why it is needed.\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nThere are a lot of libraries that allow recursively traversing files in a directory. It's also easy to do without third-party libraries, all the necessary batteries are included. Why do we need `dirstree`?\n\nThis library provides several advantages:\n\n1. The most compact and pythonic interface for iterating through files.\n2. The ability to filter files by extensions, text templates in `.gitignore` format, as well as using custom functions.\n3. Support for [cancellation tokens](https://github.com/pomponchik/cantok). This is useful if your program can run for a long time with a large number of files.\n4. The ability to easily combine several different directory crawl conditions into a single object.\n5. 100% test coverage, of course!\n\nThe simplest example of syntax:\n\n```python\nfrom dirstree import Crawler\n\ncrawler = Crawler('.')\n\nfor file in crawler:\n    print(file)\n```\n\nAs you can see, it's beautiful and there's nothing superfluous.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nAnyone who has to work with the file system throw Python.\n\n# Comparison\n\nThere are many similar libraries, but the same combination of beautiful python syntax, support for cancellation tokens, and a large number of types of filtering no longer exists.",

Specifically:\n\n* Teams needing quick utilities (image resizers, data converters, batch processors)\n* Data scientists prototyping experiments before building proper UIs\n* DevOps creating one-off automation tools\n* Anyone who needs a UI \"right now\" for a Python function\n\n**Not suitable for:**\n\n* Production web applications (no authentication, basic security)\n* Public-facing tools\n* Complex multi-page applications\n\nThink of it as duct tape for internal tooling - fast, functional, disposable.\n\n# Comparison\n\n**vs Gradio/Streamlit:**\n\n* **Scope:** They're frameworks for building complete apps. FuncToWeb wraps individual functions.\n* **Use case:** Gradio/Streamlit for dashboards and demos. FuncToWeb for one-off utilities.\n* **Complexity:** They have thousands of lines. This is 350 lines of Python + 700 lines HTML/CSS/JS.\n* **Philosophy:** They're opinionated frameworks. This is a minimal library.\n\n**vs FastAPI Forms:**\n\n* FastAPI requires writing HTML templates and routes manually\n* FuncToWeb generates everything from type hints automatically\n* FastAPI is for building APIs. This is for quick UIs.\n\n**vs FuncToGUI (my previous project):**\n\n* Web-based instead of desktop (Kivy)\n* Works remotely, easier to share\n* Better image/plot support\n* Cleaner API using `Annotated`\n\n# Technical Details\n\n**Built with:** FastAPI, Pydantic, Jinja2\n\n**Features:**\n\n* Real-time validation (client + server)\n* File uploads with type checking\n* Smart output detection (text/JSON/images/plots)\n* Mobile-responsive UI\n* **Multi-function support** \\- Serve multiple tools from one server\n\nThe repo has 14 runnable examples covering basic forms, image processing, and data visualization.\n\n# Installation\n\n    pip install func-to-web\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/offerrall/FuncToWeb](https://github.com/offerrall/FuncToWeb)\n\nFeedback is welcome!",

    "content": "Hey folks\n\nI built a small tool called PyPIPlus.com that helps you quickly see all dependencies for any Python package on PyPI.\n\nIt started because I got tired of manually checking dependencies when installing packages on servers with limited or no internet access. We all know that pain trying to figure out what else you need to download by digging through package metadata or pip responses.\n\nWith PyPIPlus, you just type the package name and instantly get a clean list of all its dependencies (and their dependencies). No installation, no login, no ads — just fast info.\n\nWhy it’s useful: • Makes offline installs a lot easier (especially for isolated servers) • Saves time • Great for auditing or just understanding what a package actually pulls in\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts — bugs, ideas, or anything you think would make it better. It’s still early and I’m open to improving it.\n\n[https://pypiplus.com](https://pypiplus.com)\n\nUPDATE: thank you everyone for the positive comments and feedback, please feel free share any additional ideas we can make this a better tool. I’ll be making sure of taking each comment and feature requests mentioned and try to make it available in the next push update 🙏\n\nUPDATE #2: Added extra detailed packages information, dependents view, and an offline bundle generator that includes all dependency wheels, pinned requirements, universal installer, SBOM, and license summaries for one-step installations. Improved UI and performance.

But I've got friends who think this isn't \"real coding\" and that I'm just letting the AI do all the work. Some call it \"vibe coding,\" which I guess is a thing now?\n\n\n\nI don't really agree though. You still need to understand the code and syntax to know whether Copilot's suggestion is actually good or complete garbage. It's more like having a really smart coding buddy who sometimes gives great suggestions and sometimes suggests weird stuff you have to ignore.\n\n\n\nWhat's everyone's take on this?

Currently, a module is eagerly loaded at the point of the import statement. Lazy imports defer the loading and execution of a module until the first time the imported name is used.\n\nBy allowing developers to mark individual imports as lazy with explicit syntax, Python programs can reduce startup time, memory usage, and unnecessary work. This is particularly beneficial for command-line tools, test suites, and applications with large dependency graphs.\n\nThe proposal preserves full backwards compatibility: normal import statements remain unchanged, and lazy imports are enabled only where explicitly requested.",

    "content": "**What My Project Does**\n\nHi! I've been training a lot of neural networks recently and want to share with you a tool I created.\n\nWhile training pytorch models, I noticed that it is very hard to write reusable code for training models. There are packages that help track metrics, logs, and checkpoints, but they often create more problems than they solve. As a result, training pipelines become bloated with infrastructure code that obscures the actual business logic.\n\nThat’s why I created TorchSystem a package designed to help you build extensible training systems using domain-driven design principles, to replace ugly training scripts with clean, modular, and fully featured training services, with type annotations and modern python syntax.\n\n**Repository**:[ https://github.com/entropy-flux/TorchSystem](https://github.com/entropy-flux/TorchSystem)\n\n**Documentation**:[ https://entropy-flux.github.io/TorchSystem/](https://entropy-flux.github.io/TorchSystem/)\n\n**Full working example**:[ https://github.com/entropy-flux/TorchSystem/tree/main/examples/mnist-mlp](https://github.com/entropy-flux/TorchSystem/tree/main/examples/mnist-mlp)\n\n**Target Audience**\n\n* ML engineers building **complex training pipelines** who need modularity.\n* Researchers experimenting with **custom training loops** without reinventing boilerplate.\n* Developers who want **DDD-inspired architecture** in their AI projects.\n* Anyone frustrated with hard-to-maintain \"script soup\" training code.\n\n**Comparison**\n\n* [pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning): There aren't any framework doing this,[ pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/pytorch-lightning) come close by encapsulating all kind of infrastructure and the training loop inside a custom class, but it doesn't provide a way to actually decouple the logic from the implementation details. You can use a LightningModule  instead of my Aggregate class, and use the whole the message system of the library to bind it with other tools you want.\n* [mlflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow): Helps with model tracking and checkpoints, but again, you will end up with a lot of infrastructure logic inside your training loop, you can actually plug tracking libraries like this inside Consumer or a Subscriber and pass metrics as events or to topics as serializable messages.\n* [neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai/): Web infra for metric tracking, like[ mlflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow) you can plug it like a consumer or a subscriber, the good thing is that thanks to dependency inversion you can plug many of these tracking libraries at the same time to the same publisher and send the metrics to all of them.\n\nHope you find it useful!",

[Structlog](https://www.structlog.org/) is one of the better tools in the Python ecosystem for achieving this with a more intuitive model than the standard logging's system of handlers, formatters, and filters.\n\n[I wrote a guide](https://www.dash0.com/guides/python-logging-with-structlog) that provides a step-by-step walkthrough for implementing clean, production-ready logging with Structlog.\n\nKeen to hear your thoughts, and if you think it's worth switching to from the `logging` module.",

    "content": "Attention ⚠️ : NOT another AI wrapper\n\nBeta released today - open to feedback - especially bugs\n\nhttps://github.com/tylerrobbins5678/PyThermite\n\nhttps://pypi.org/project/pythermite/\n\n-**what My Project Does**\n\nPyThermite is a rust backed python object indexer that supports nested objects and queries with real-time data. In plain terms, this means that complex data relations can be conveyed in objects, maintained state, and queried easily. For example, if I have a list of 100k cars in a city and want to get a list of cars moving between 20 and 40 mph and the owner of the car is named \"Jim\" that was born after 2005, that can be a single built query with sub 1 ms response. Keep in mind that the cars speed is constantly changing, updating the data structures as it goes.\n\nIn testing, its significantly (20- 50x) faster than pandas dataframe filtering on a data size of 100k. Query time complexity is roughly O(q + r) where q is the amount of query operations (and, or, in, eq, gt, nesting, etc) and r is the result size. \n\nThe cost to index is defined paid and building the structure takes around 6-7x longer than a dataframe consuming a list, but definitely worth it if the data is queried more than 3-4 times\n\nPerformance has been and is still a constant battle with the hashmap and b-tree inserts consuming most of the process time. \n\n-**Target Audience**\n\nCurrently this is not production ready as it is not tested thoroughly. Once proven, it will be supported and continue driving towards ETL and simulation within OOP driven code. At this current state it should only be used for analytics and analysis \n\n-**Conparison**\n\nThis competes with traditional dataframes like arrow, pandas, and polars, except it is the only one that handles native objects internally as well as indexes attributes for highly performant lookup. There's a few small alternatives out there, but nothing written with this much focus on performance.",

Using Python Asyncio and Aiohttp, it can handle bulk downloads, scaling to millions of panoramas per day.\n\n\\- Other solutions don’t match up because they ignore edge cases, especially pre-2016 images with different resolutions. They used fixed width and height that only worked for post-2016 panoramas, which caused black spaces in older ones.\n\n**Target Audience** \n\n\"For educational purposes only\" ***- just in case Google is watching.*** \n\nIt was a fun project to work on, as there was no documentation whatsoever, whether by Google or other existing solutions. So, I documented the key points that explain why a panorama image looks the way it does based on the given inputs (mainly zoom levels).\n\nThe way I was able to reverse engineer Google Maps Street View API was by sitting all day for a week, doing nothing but observing the results of the endpoint, testing inputs, assembling panoramas, observing outputs, and repeating. With no documentation, no lead, and no reference, it was all trial and error.\n\nI believe I have covered most edge cases, though I still doubt I may have missed some. Despite testing hundreds of panoramas at different inputs, I’m sure there could be a case I didn’t encounter. So feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request if you come across one, or find a bug/unexpected behavior.\n\nThanks for checking it out!",

    "content": "Hey everyone! I built a tool to search for images and videos locally using natural language with [Google's sigLIP 2 model](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip2-so400m-patch16-naflex).\n\nI'm looking for people to test it and share feedback, especially about how it runs on different hardware.\n\nDon't mind the ugly GUI, I just wanted to make it as simple and accessible as possible, but you can still use it as a command line tool anyway if you want to. You can find the repository here: [https://github.com/Gabrjiele/siglip2-naflex-search](https://github.com/Gabrjiele/siglip2-naflex-search)\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nMy project, `siglip2-naflex-search`, is a desktop tool that lets you search your local image and video files using natural language. You can find media by typing a description (of varying degrees of complexity) or by using an existing image to find similar ones. It features both a user-friendly graphical interface and a command-line interface for automation. The tool uses Google's powerful SigLIP 2 model to understand the content of your files and stores the data locally in an SQLite database for fast, private searching.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nThis tool is designed for anyone with a large local collection of photos and videos who wants a better way to navigate them. It is particularly useful for:\n\n* **Photographers and videographers** needing to quickly find specific shots within their archives.\n* **AI enthusiasts and developers** looking for a hands-on project that uses a SOTA vision-language model.\n* **Privacy-conscious users** who prefer an offline solution for managing their personal media without uploading it to the cloud.\n\n**IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR LARGE SCALE ENTERPRISE PRODUCTION**.\n\n# Comparison\n\nThis project stands apart from alternatives like `rclip` and other search tools built on the original CLIP model in a few significant ways:\n\n* **Superior model**: It is built on **Google's SigLIP 2**, a more recent and powerful model that provides better performance and efficiency in image-text retrieval compared to the original CLIP used by `rclip`. SigLIP 2's training method leads to improved semantic understanding.\n* **Flexible resolution (NaFlex)**: The tool utilizes the `naflex` variant of SigLIP 2, which can process images at various resolutions while preserving their original aspect ratio. This is a major advantage over standard CLIP models that often resize images to a fixed square, which can distort content and reduce accuracy (especially in OCR applications).\n* **GUI and CLI**: Unlike `rclip` which is primarily a command-line tool, this project offers both a **very simple graphical interface (will update in the future) and a command line interface**. This makes it accessible to a broader audience, from casual users to developers who need scripting capabilities.\n* **Integrated video search**: It's one of the very few tools that provides video searching as a built-in feature: it extracts and indexes frames to make video content searchable out of the box.",

I’d really appreciate your thoughts and contributions! 🙂\n\n**Note: This Project is Not Vibe-Coded or AI Used i am Only Have Used AI for Documentation Purposes to Speed up Initial Development Only, the Code itself is Mine and Implemented by Mine (No AI Usage from the start itself) and also the performance of logly is not tested fully yet because this project is still in active development!**\n\n**UPDATE!!! 🚀** (03-10-2025) Thanks for all the feedback, everyone! Based on user requests, I’ve improved **Logly v0.1.4** (Released now) and added some new features. I’ve also updated the documentation for better clarity.\n\n✅ Currently, Logly supports **Linux, Windows, and macOS** for **Python 3.10 to 3.13**. 📖 Please report any issues or errors directly on **GitHub,** that’s the best place for bug reports and feature requests (not Reddit). For broader conversations, please use [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly/discussions).\n\nFor those [asking for proof of my work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nhdisrd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button): I’ve been actively coding and tracking my projects via [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/@muhammadfiaz), and I have a good community supporting my work.\n\nI understand some people may not like the project, and that’s fine, you’re free to have your opinion. But if you want to give constructive feedback, please do it openly on GitHub under your real account instead of throwaway or anonymous ones. That way, the feedback is more helpful and transparent.\n\nBTW! I take **docstrings and documentation very seriously :) ,** I personally review every single one each time to ensure quality and clarity. If anything is missing or not updated for the latest release, you can always create an issue or a PR. I always welcome contributions.\n\nAlso, judging whether I used AI just based on [my *constant* bullet points, bold text or docstrings ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nh9h8ua/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)in the Rust code? That’s really childish,  comments and docstrings alone aren’t proof of anything. I always make sure to add both to keep everything well-documented for contributors, and also saying \"[Rust Devs don't use comments and docstrings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nhe8f9v/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\" but I’ve seen plenty of experienced Rust developers use them as well, in Rust and across all programming languages.\n\nFinally 🙂 I am not promoting or making statements about whether using AI is right or wrong, good practice or bad practice, it depends entirely on your use case and personal preference and up to you only.\n\nIf you still insist this is “vibe coding,” then fine, that’s your opinion. If not, then it’s whatever, I don’t care. I am using my **real name** and being transparent. Just because I work on this project personally doesn’t mean it’s for a [job or resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nh7zjyc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button); I’ve clearly stated that in my profile. If you want to collaborate, feel free to do so for **improvements**, but commenting about [useless things](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nhdyz6a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) or **misleading claims by** [puppeteer accounts](https://www.reddit.com/user/bay400/) doesn’t help anyone.\n\nI wrote this message for people who are genuinely interested in creating new methods or contributing. [I am not promoting the project simply because it’s in Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nhdyp23/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button),I wanted **feedback**, which is why I’m asking for input here for improvement, not for childish debates about whether I used AI or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, we’re all here to learn, whether you have 20+ years of experience in IT or you’re just a newbie. **Constructive discussion and improvements help everyone grow.**\n\nAnd just to be clear I’m doing this to build awesome things in public and grow in public, so people can see the progress, learn, and contribute along the way :)\n\n**Thanks again for all your support! 🙏🙂**",

It can get messy fast, and there's no good way to test or version them.\n\nI wanted a more robust, \"Pythonic\" way to handle this, so I built ProML (Prompt Markup Language).\n\nIt's an open-source toolchain, written in Python and installable via pip, that lets you define, test, and manage prompts as first-class citizens in your project.\n\nInstead of just strings, you define prompts in .proml files, which are validated against a formal spec. You can then load and run them easily within your Python code:\n\nimport proml\n\nLoad a structured prompt from a file\n\nprompt = proml.load(\"prompts/sentiment_analysis.proml\")\n\nExecute it with type-safe inputs\n\nresult = prompt.run(comment=\"This is a great product!\")\n\nprint(result.content)\n\n=&gt; \"positive\"\n\nSome of the key features:\n\nPure Python &amp; Pip Installable: The parser, runtime, and CLI are all built in Python.\n\nFull CLI Toolchain: Includes commands to lint, fmt, test, run, and publish your prompts.\n\nTesting Framework: You can define test cases directly in the prompt files to validate LLM outputs against regex, JSON Schema, etc.\n\nLibrary Interface: Designed to be easily integrated into any Python application\n\nVersioning &amp; Registry: A local registry system to manage and reuse prompts across projects with semver.\n\nI'm the author and would love to get feedback from the Python community. What do you think of this approach?\n\nYou can check out the source and more examples on GitHub, or install it and give it a try.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/Caripson/ProML\n\nDocs : https://github.com/Caripson/ProML/blob/main/docs/index.md\n\nTarget audience: LLM developers, prompt-engineers \n\nComparison: haven’t found any similar ",

You just set the Python executable path, add your script and arguments (for example -u for unbuffered mode if you want stdout and stderr logging), choose the startup type, working directory, and environment variables, configure any optional parameters, click install — and you’re done. Servy comes with a GUI, CLI, PowerShell integration, and a manager app for monitoring services in real time.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nServy is meant for developers or sysadmins who need to keep Python scripts running reliably in the background without having to rewrite them as Windows services. It works equally well for Node.js, .NET, or any executable, but I built it with Python apps in mind. It’s designed for production use on Windows 7 through Windows 11 as well as Windows Server.\n\nComparison\n\nCompared to tools like sc or nssm, Servy adds important features that make managing services easier. It lets you set a custom working directory (avoiding the common C:\\Windows\\System32 issue that breaks relative paths), redirect stdout and stderr to rotating log files, and configure health checks with automatic recovery and restart policies. It also provides a clean, modern UI and real-time service management, making it more user-friendly and capable than existing options.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/aelassas/servy\n\nDemo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biHq17j4RbI\n\nAny feedback is welcome.",

    "content": "What is everyone's experience with adding type hints to the test suite? Do you do it (or are required to do it at work)? Do you think it is worth it?\n\nI tried it with a couple of my own projects recently, and it did uncover some bugs, API inconsistencies, and obsolete tests that just happened to still work despite types not being right. But there were also a number of annoyances (which perhaps would not be as noticeable if I added typing as I wrote the tests and not all at once). Most notably, due to the unfortunate convention of `mypy`, I had to add `-&gt; None` to all the test functions. There were also a number of cases where I used duck typing to make the tests visually simpler, which had to be amended to be more strict. Overall I'm leaning towards doing it in the future for new projects.",

    "title": "py-capnweb - A Python implementation of Cap'n Web's RPC protocol",
    "content": "I've just released v0.3.0 of a project I've been working on called **py-capnweb**.\n\nIt's a Python implementation of the [Cap'n Web protocol](https://github.com/cloudflare/capnweb), a fascinating new RPC protocol announced a couple of weeks ago. My implementation is **fully interoperable** with the official TypeScript version, so you can have a Python backend talking to a TypeScript/JS frontend (and vice-versa) seamlessly.\n\n# What The Project Does\n\n`py-capnweb` is designed to eliminate the friction of client-server communication. It makes remote function calls feel just like local function calls. Instead of manually writing HTTP endpoints, serializing data, and dealing with network waterfalls, you can design your APIs like you would a normal JavaScript or Python library.\n\nTwo main features stand out: **capability-based security** and **promise pipelining**. This means you pass around secure object references instead of raw data, and you can chain multiple dependent calls into a single network round trip, which can be a huge performance win.\n\n# Target Audience &amp; Production Readiness\n\nThis project is for developers building interactive, cross-language applications (e.g., Python backend, JS/TS frontend) who are tired of the boilerplate and latency issues that come with traditional REST or even GraphQL APIs.\n\n**Is it production-ready?** The protocol itself is new but built on the mature foundations of Cap'n Proto. My implementation is at `v0.3.0` and passes a comprehensive cross-implementation test suite. It's stable and ready for real-world use cases, especially for teams that want to be on the cutting edge of RPC technology.\n\n# How is it Different from REST, gRPC, or GraphQL?\n\nThis is the most important question! Here’s a quick comparison:\n\n* **vs. REST:** REST is resource-oriented, using a fixed set of verbs (GET, POST, etc.). Cap'n Web is object-oriented, allowing you to call methods on remote objects directly. This avoids the \"N+1\" problem and complex state management on the client, thanks to promise pipelining.\n* **vs. gRPC:** gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework, but it's schema-based (using Protocol Buffers). Cap'n Web is schema-less, making it more flexible and feel more native to dynamic languages like Python and JavaScript, which means less boilerplate. While gRPC has streaming, Cap'n Web's promise pipelining and bidirectional nature provide a more expressive way to handle complex, stateful interactions.\n* **vs. GraphQL:** GraphQL is excellent for querying complex data graphs in one go. However, it's a specialized query language and can be awkward for mutations or chained operations. Cap'n Web solves the same \"over-fetching\" problem as GraphQL but feels like writing regular code, not a query. You can intuitively chain calls (`user.getProfile()`, `profile.getFriends()`, etc.) in a single, efficient batch.\n\n# Key Features of py-capnweb\n\n* **100% TypeScript Interoperability**: Fully tested against the official `capnweb` library.\n* **Promise Pipelining**: Batch dependent calls into a single network request to slash latency.\n* **Capability-Based Security**: Pass around secure object references, not exposed data.\n* **Bidirectional RPC**: It's peer-to-peer; the \"server\" can call the \"client\" just as easily.\n* **Pluggable Transports**: Supports HTTP batch and WebSocket out-of-the-box. (More planned!)\n* **Fully Async**: Built on Python's `asyncio`.\n* **Type-Safe**: Complete type hints (tested with `pyrefly`/`mypy`).\n\n# See it in Action\n\nHere’s how simple it is to get started.\n\n**(Server,** `server.py`\\*\\*)\\*\\*\n\n    import asyncio\n    from typing import Any\n    from capnweb.server import Server, ServerConfig\n    from capnweb.types import RpcTarget\n    from capnweb.error import RpcError\n    \n    class Calculator(RpcTarget):\n        async def call(self, method: str, args: list[Any]) -&gt; Any:\n            match method:\n                case \"add\":\n                    return args[0] + args[1]\n                case \"subtract\":\n                    return args[0] - args[1]\n                case _:\n                    raise RpcError.not_found(f\"Method {method} not found\")\n    \n    async def main() -&gt; None:\n        config = ServerConfig(host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8080)\n        server = Server(config)\n        server.register_capability(0, Calculator()) # Register main capability\n        await server.start()\n        print(\"Calculator server listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080/rpc/batch\")\n        await asyncio.Event().wait()\n    \n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        asyncio.run(main())\n\n**(Client,** `client.py`\\*\\*)\\*\\*\n\n    import asyncio\n    from capnweb.client import Client, ClientConfig\n    \n    async def main() -&gt; None:\n        config = ClientConfig(url=\"http://localhost:8080/rpc/batch\")\n        async with Client(config) as client:\n            result = await client.call(0, \"add\", [5, 3])\n            print(f\"5 + 3 = {result}\")  # Output: 5 + 3 = 8\n    \n            result = await client.call(0, \"subtract\", [10, 4])\n            print(f\"10 - 4 = {result}\")  # Output: 10 - 4 = 6\n    \n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        asyncio.run(main())\n\n# Check it out!\n\nI'd love for you to take a look, try it out, and let me know what you think. I believe this paradigm can genuinely improve how we build robust, cross-language distributed systems.\n\n* **GitHub Repo**: [https://github.com/abilian/py-capnweb](https://github.com/abilian/py-capnweb)\n* **Installation**: `pip install capnweb` or `uv add capnweb`\n\nThe project is dual-licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0. All feedback, issues, and contributions are welcome!\n\n**TL;DR:** I built a Python version of the new Cap'n Web RPC protocol that's 100% compatible with the official TypeScript version. It's built on `asyncio`, is schema-less, and uses promise pipelining to make distributed programming feel more like local development.",

    "content": "Hi everybody! I find myself in need of a workflow engine (I'm DevOps, so I'll be using it and administering it), and it seems the Python space is exploding with options right now. I'm passingly familiar with Celery+Canvas and DAG-based tools such as Airflow, but the hot new thing seems to be Durable Execution frameworks like Temporal.io, DBOS, Hatchet, etc. I'd love to hear stories from people actually using and managing such things in the wild, as part of evaluating which option is best for me.\n\nJust from reading over these projects docs, I can give my initial impressions:\n\n* Temporal.io - enterprise-ready, lots of operational bits and bobs to manage, seems to want to take over your entire project\n* DBOS - way less operational impact, but also no obvious way to horizontally scale workers independent of app servers (which is sort of a key feature for me)\n* Hatchet - evolving fast, Durable Execution/Workflow bits seem fairly recent, no obvious way to logically segment queues, etc. by tenant (Temporal has Namespaces, Celery+Canvas has Virtual Hosts in RabbitMQ, DBOS… might be leveraging your app database, so it inherits whatever you are doing there?)\n\nAm I missing any of the big (Python) players?

    "content": "Hi everyone, our team just launched [**Crawlee for Python 🐍**](https://github.com/apify/crawlee-python/) **v1.0**, an open source web scraping and automation library. We launched the beta version in Aug 2024 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1dyyaky/crawlee_for_python_is_live/), and got a lot of feedback. With new features like Adaptive crawler, unified storage client system, Impit HTTP client, and a lot of new things, the library is ready for its public launch.\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nIt's an open-source web scraping and automation library, which provides a unified interface for HTTP and browser-based scraping, using popular libraries like [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) under the hood.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nThe target audience is developers who wants to try a scalable crawling and automation library which offers a suite of features that makes life easier than others. We launched the beta version a year ago, got a lot of feedback, worked on it with help of early adopters and launched Crawlee for Python v1.0.\n\n**New features**\n\n* **Unified storage client system**: less duplication, better extensibility, and a cleaner developer experience. It also opens the door for the community to build and share their own storage client implementations.\n* **Adaptive Playwright crawler**: makes your crawls faster and cheaper, while still allowing you to reliably handle complex, dynamic websites. In practice, you get the best of both worlds: speed on simple pages and robustness on modern, JavaScript-heavy sites.\n* **New default HTTP client** (ImpitHttpClient, powered by the [Impit](https://github.com/apify/impit) library): fewer false positives, more resilient crawls, and less need for complicated workarounds. Impit is also developed as an open-source project by Apify, so you can dive into the internals or contribute improvements yourself: you can also create your own instance, configure it to your needs (e.g. enable HTTP/3 or choose a specific browser profile), and pass it into your crawler.\n* **Sitemap request loader**: easier to start large-scale crawls where sitemaps already provide full coverage of the site\n* **Robots exclusion standard**: not only helps you build ethical crawlers, but can also save time and bandwidth by skipping disallowed or irrelevant pages\n* **Fingerprinting**: each crawler run looks like a real browser on a real device. Using fingerprinting in Crawlee is straightforward: create a fingerprint generator with your desired options and pass it to the crawler.\n* **Open telemetry**: monitor real-time dashboards or analyze traces to understand crawler performance. easier to integrate Crawlee into existing monitoring pipelines\n\n**Find out more**\n\nOur team will be here in r/Python for an **AMA** on **Wednesday 8th October 2025, at 9am EST/2pm GMT/3pm CET/6:30pm IST**. We will be answering questions about webscraping, Python tooling, moving products out of beta, testing, versioning, and much more!\n\nCheck out our GitHub repo and blog for more info!\n\n**Links**\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/apify/crawlee-python/](https://github.com/apify/crawlee-python/)  \nDiscord: [https://apify.com/discord](https://apify.com/discord)  \nCrawlee website: [https://crawlee.dev/python/](https://crawlee.dev/python/)  \nBlogpost: [https://crawlee.dev/blog/crawlee-for-python-v1](https://crawlee.dev/blog/crawlee-for-python-v1)",

Cloud-based solutions, on the other hand, are polished and offer seamless cross-device sync, but they usually come with privacy trade-offs, vendor lock-in, or a subscription cost.\n\n**Poottu tries to strike a balance between the two** — it’s completely offline and open-source like CLI tools, but it also provides a clean, beginner-friendly desktop GUI that makes managing entries much easier.\n\nThe trade-off is that Poottu doesn’t ship with built-in sync. In short: Poottu aims to sit between a low-level CLI vault like `pass` and full-featured cloud managers — offering **local safety plus a friendly UI**.\n\n# Availability\n\n* GitHub: [github.com/manikandancode/poottu](https://github.com/manikandancode/poottu)\n* PyPI: [pypi.org/project/poottu](https://pypi.org/project/poottu/)\n\n# License\n\nMIT License\n\n# Installation\n\nYou can install from PyPI:\n\n    pip install poottu\n\nThen run:\n\n    poottu\n\nI beautified and commented the code using AI to improve readability and inline documentation. If you try it out — I’d love feedback, issues, or ideas for improvements and security. Thanks for checking it out. Hope it’s useful to someone here! 🙏",

    "content": "You might already know the memes behind forgetting to end a line with a semi-colon `(;)`.\n\nAnd it's kind of funny how Python doesn't fall into this problem.\n\nYou should, however, watch out for not ending a line with a comma in this particular scenario.\n\nThis scenario being having a list that extends multiple lines vertically.\n\n```python\nEXAMPLE_CONST_LIST = [\n    \"main.py\",     #  &lt;------ Make sure there is a trailing comma\n    \"__pycache__\"\n]\n```\n\n&gt; Python does not throw an error and errors silently\n\n## What Happened to me?\nI recently had this issue where I forgot to end an element with a comma. My program wasn't following the logical rules that I wanted it to follow. And this was a simple script, a little script. Nothing fancy, not a **HUGE** project. Just one file with a few lines:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nEXCEPTIONS = [\n    \"main.py\"  # missing a comma here\n    \"__pycache__\"\n]\n\nfor file in os.listdir():\n    if file in EXCEPTIONS:\n        continue\n    \n    # Rest of logic that I wanted\n```\n\nNotice the missing comma, I couldn't deduce the problem for 3 minutes straight. No errors thrown, just errored silently and executed some unwanted logic.\n\nIf you might not know, without adding a comma, the constant variable `EXCEPTIONS` from the previous snippet turns into:\n\n```text\n[\"main.py__pycache__\"]\n```\n\nEssentially, concatenates the underlying elements. Not sure why Python decided this was a good idea but if you find yourself defining an array vertically, let this serve as a reminder to make sure to end each element with comma.",

    "content": "Hello [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/).  \nI know, I know, there are several release-bumping tools out there, but none integrate with uv the way I would like them to. They also feel kind of bloated for what I need them to do. I simply wanted to use `uv version` to update my project metadata, paired with a small pipeline that safeguards the process and ships the changes + version tag to the repo.\n\nIf you're curious, please check out [**uv-ship**](https://floraths.github.io/uv-ship/)\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;**preflight checks**: guard your release workflow by verifying branch, tags, and a clean working tree before shipping.\n\n&gt;**changelog generation**: auto-builds changelog sections from commits since the latest tag.\n\n&gt;**one-shot release**: stage, commit, tag, and push in a single step.\n\n&gt;**dry-run mode**: preview every action before making changes.\n\n**Target Audience** \n\nmaintainers of uv-managed projects with strict release workflows.\n\n**Comparison**  \nuv-ship is similar in scope to [bump-my-version](https://callowayproject.github.io/bump-my-version/) but it integrates with uv out-of-the-box. For example, if you use bump-my-version you need to set up the following workflow:\n\n1. execute version bump with `bump-my-version bump minor`\n2. include a pre-commit hook that runs `uv sync`\n3. tell bump-my-version that pyproject.toml and uv.lock need to be committed\n4. create the tag and push it manually\n\nbump-my-version offers automation with pre- and post-commit hooks, but it does not evaluate if the tag is safe to be pushed (all requirements met for release?)\n\nall those steps are completed and validated during the uv-ship pipeline:\n\nthe command syntax for the same operation (and some more) is: `$ uv-ship next minor`\n\nyou can play around in `--dry-run` mode to see the CLI in action.

    "content": "sparkenforce is a PySpark type annotation package that lets you specify and enforce DataFrame schemas using Python type hints.\n\n## What My Project Does\n\nWorking with PySpark DataFrames can be frustrating when schemas don’t match what you expect, especially when they lead to runtime errors downstream.\n\nsparkenforce solves this by:\n\n* Adding type annotations for DataFrames (columns + types) using Python type hints.\n* Providing a `@validate` decorator to enforce schemas at runtime for function arguments and return values.\n* Offering clear error messages when mismatches occur (missing/extra columns, wrong types, etc.).\n* Supporting flexible schemas with ..., optional columns, and even custom Python ↔ Spark type mappings.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nfrom sparkenforce import validate\nfrom pyspark.sql import DataFrame, functions as fn\n\n@validate\ndef add_length(df: DataFrame[\"firstname\": str]) -&gt; DataFrame[\"name\": str, \"length\": int]:\n    return df.select(\n        df.firstname.alias(\"name\"),\n        fn.length(\"firstname\").alias(\"length\")\n    )\n```\n\nIf the input DataFrame doesn’t contain \"firstname\", you’ll get a `DataFrameValidationError` immediately.\n\n## Target Audience\n\n* PySpark developers who want stronger contracts between DataFrame transformations.\n* Data engineers maintaining ETL pipelines, where schema changes often breaks stuff.\n* Teams that want to make their PySpark code more self-documenting and easier to understand.\n\n## Comparison\n\n* Inspired by [dataenforce](https://github.com/CedricFR/dataenforce) (Pandas-oriented), but extended for PySpark DataFrames.\n* Unlike static type checkers (e.g. mypy), sparkenforce enforces schemas at runtime, catching real mismatches in Spark pipelines.\n* [spark-expectations](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/spark-expectations) has a wider aproach, tackling various data quality rules (validating the data itself, adding observability, etc.). sparkenforce focuses only on schema or structure data contracts.\n\n## Links\n\n* PyPI: [sparkenforce](https://pypi.org/project/sparkenforce/)\n* Source code: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/agustin-recoba/sparkenforce)\n* Demo notebook: [Examples](https://github.com/agustin-recoba/sparkenforce/blob/main/src/demo/demo_notebook.ipynb)",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm developing an open-source tool to automate the job search and would love to get your feedback on it. As required by the 'Showcase' flair rules, here's the breakdown:\n\nWhat My Project Does\nOrionJobs AI is a platform that automates the collection of job opportunities for developers. It integrates with multiple job board APIs (like RemoteOK and Adzuna) to aggregate, process, and store job listings in a central database. The long-term vision is to use AI to provide personalized job recommendations based on a user's skills and profile.\n\nTarget Audience\nPrimarily, it's for junior to mid-level developers who are actively job hunting and tired of the repetitive, manual process of checking multiple websites every day. It's built for developers who appreciate automation and want a more intelligent way to find their next opportunity.\n\nComparison\nCompared to manually browsing LinkedIn or other job boards, OrionJobs AI saves significant time by centralizing opportunities. Unlike a simple RSS feed, it structures and normalizes the data. The key differentiator in the future will be its AI-powered recommendation engine, which aims to provide more relevant matches than the generic algorithms used by larger platforms.\n\nCurrent Status:\nThe backend is 100% \"cloud-ready,\" built with Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and fully containerized with Docker. The data collection system is operational. The full roadmap is in the README.\n\nI'd love to get your feedback on the code, the architecture, or the general idea. The project is completely open to contributions (I've already tagged some good first issues for anyone looking to get started).\n\nGitHub Repo: https://github.com/GuiDev-01/orion-jobs-ai\n\nThanks for the support!",

Because clearly the best way to keep your intellectual property is to deposit it on a who-knows-what site you’ve never ever known, owned and operated people you’ll never ever meet, with no idea anywhere your source goes. Completely secure.\n\nEven if you think the site will not retain a copy of your code, the real “obfuscation” is going to be farcical. We discuss base64, XOR, hex encoding, perhaps zlib compression, in a few spaghetti exec function calls. This isn’t security, painting and crafts. It can be unwritten anybody who possesses a ten-minute-half-decent Google. But geez, at least it does look menacing from a first glance, doesn’t it?\n\nYou actually experience a false sense of security and the true probability of having just opened your complete codebase to a dodgy server somewhere. And if you’re particularly unlucky, they’ll mail back to you a “protected” file that not only includes a delicious little backdoor but also one you’ll eagerly send off to your unsuspecting users. Well done, you just gave away supply-chain malware for free.\n\nIf you truly do want to protect code, there are actual tools for it. Cython runs to C extensions. Nuitka runs projects to native executables. Encrypts bytecode and does machine binding. Not tricks, but at least make it hard and come from people who don’t want your source comed to be pushed to their private webserver. And the actual solution? Don’t push secrets to begin with. Put keys and sensitive logic on a server people can’t touch.\n\nSo yeh… do not the next time your eyes glaze over at “just plug your Python code into our free web obfuscator.” Unless your security mindset is “keep my younger brother from cheating and reading my homework,” congratulations, your secret’s safe.",

I'm actively looking for feedback from experienced Python developers on its design and architecture.\n\nThis is a complete application boilerplate built using the **NiceGUI** framework, which allows the creation of web-based UIs using **pure Python &amp; HTML/CSS/JS**. My project provides a structure for a larger, multi-page NiceGUI application.\n\n**What My Project Does:**\n\nThis template introduces a modern structure to simplify building and maintaining complex NiceGUI apps, moving beyond single-file examples.\n\nKey structural features:\n\n* **Modular Component System:** UI pages and major elements are reusable Python classes/functions, managing their own layout and logic.\n* **Service Layer:** Business logic (e.g., data handling, API calls) is strictly separated into a dedicated `services/` directory, keeping UI code clean.\n* **Clean Starter Layout:** Provides a production-ready, responsive layout with a collapsible sidebar and consistent routing.\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\nThis is aimed at **experienced Python developers** and **teams** who need a structured foundation for building production-grade or highly-functional internal tools with NiceGUI. It's ideal for those focused on **scalability and maintainability**.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nStandard NiceGUI documentation often focuses on simple, single-file scripts. This boilerplate differs by offering a full-scale, opinionated structure similar to what is used in modern web development frameworks.\n\n**Source Code:**\n\n**GitHub Repository:** [`https://github.com/frycodelab/nicegui-component-based`](https://github.com/frycodelab/nicegui-component-based)\n\nI welcome all feedback on the architectural patterns and how this template can be improved for real-world use cases.",

    "content": "Hey everyone, A while ago, I started working on a project called **Ducky**, and I'm blown away by the support and feedback I've received. We recently passed a new star milestone on GitHub, and I just wanted to say a huge **thank you** to everyone who has shown interest, offered feedback, or contributed. It means the world to me.\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nDucky is a free, open-source desktop application that consolidates the essential tools of a network engineer or security enthusiast into a single, easy-to-use interface. Instead of juggling separate applications for terminal connections, network scanning, and diagnostics (like PuTTY, Angry IP Scanner, etc.), Ducky provides a unified workspace to streamline your workflow. Its core features include a tabbed terminal (SSH, Telnet, Serial), an SNMP-powered network topology mapper, a port scanner, and a suite of security utilities like a CVE lookup and hash calculator.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nDucky is built for anyone who works with network hardware and infrastructure. It's intended to be a serious, daily-use tool for professionals, but it's also simple enough for learners.\n\n* **For Production:** Network Engineers &amp; Administrators for daily tasks like configuring switches and routers, troubleshooting connectivity, and documenting network layouts. Cybersecurity professionals can also use it for reconnaissance and analysis.\n* **For Learning:** Students and hobbyists (e.g., studying for CompTIA Network+ or CCNA) can use Ducky as a free, hands-on tool to explore and interact with real or virtual network devices.\n\n# Comparison\n\nDucky aims to fill a gap between powerful but expensive commercial tools and single-function free utilities.\n\n* **Compared to tools like SecureCRT or MobaXterm Pro:** Ducky provides many of the most-used features (tabbed multi-protocol terminal, session management) but is completely free and open-source. While it doesn't have every advanced feature of those paid tools yet, it covers the daily essentials in a clean, modern interface.\n* **Compared to using separate free tools (like PuTTY + Nmap + a separate subnet calculator):** Ducky's main advantage is integration. The tools are designed to work together. For example, you can discover a device on the Topology Map, click it to see its details, and then launch an SSH session to it without ever leaving the application. This creates a much smoother and faster workflow.\n\n**How You Can Help:**\n\nThe best way you can support the project right now is by giving it a star on GitHub! It provides a huge motivation boost and helps more people discover the tool.\n\n**Easy Download (No Python Needed!)**\n\nI've also launched a small website for the project. You can now download a **pre-packaged .exe file** directly from the site—no need to install Python or any dependencies.\n\n* **GitHub Repository (Please leave a star! ⭐):** [https://github.com/thecmdguy/Ducky](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fthecmdguy%2FDucky)\n* **Website with Direct Download:** [ducky.ge](https://ducky.ge/#download)\n\nThank you all again for the support",

    "content": "**What My Project Does**\n\nAdaptive is an intelligent router for LLM inference.\n\nInstead of sending every request to a fixed model, it:\n\n* Analyzes prompts in real time\n* Estimates **task type, domain, and complexity**\n* Routes to the most suitable model based on benchmarked performance\n\nA common issue we saw with existing approaches is that they either:\n\n* Base routing **solely on complexity scores**, which collapse everything into one dimension, or\n* Use **very broad categories** like “code generation,” which ignore the nuance between planning, debugging, or writing simple snippets.\n\nAdaptive takes a more granular approach. We use **NVIDIA’s Prompt Task and Complexity Classifier** for initial signals, but extend it with **model criteria** derived from benchmarks across task types, domains, and multiple complexity levels.\n\nThis lets us distinguish when a prompt needs high reasoning (e.g., planning or debugging) versus when a lightweight model is sufficient (e.g., writing boilerplate).\n\nWe are now integrating Google’s [UniRoute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08773) and extending it by adding task complexity and domain-awareness to the error-vector method, so routing generalizes to unseen models while staying context-aware.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nAdaptive is for developers and teams building AI products that need to balance **cost, quality, and reliability** in production.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nMost LLM routing today is naive:\n\n* Route everything to a premium model → high quality, but expensive\n* Route everything to a smaller model → cheap, but quality suffers\n* Route based only on a single complexity score → too coarse, misses nuance\n* Use broad categories like “coding” → ignores the difference between planning, debugging, and writing snippets\n\nAdaptive differs by combining **granular task classification + domain signals + benchmark-driven model criteria** instead of static rules.\n\nThe result: **60–90% lower inference costs** while keeping quality high for workloads that actually demand complex reasoning.\n\n**Repo (open source):** [github.com/Egham-7/adaptive](https://github.com/Egham-7/adaptive)  \n**Website:** [llmadaptive.uk](https://llmadaptive.uk)\n\nWould love feedback from others working on inference routing or multi-model orchestration.",

A tool for designing electrical panels: users drag-drop hierarchical elements (panels → racks → components) on a canvas, then auto-generate invoices (PDFs with BOMs). I'd like a modern UI—dark mode, smooth animations, rounded edges, the works.\n\nPriorities: Cross Platform(MacOS and Windows), high stability/perf (esp. canvas), and minimal new learning juggling other projects.\n\nI know Python and C# basics, but MVVM/XAML trips me up hard (can grind through it, but ugh). Want to stick to \\*one\\* language I can reuse for scripting/automation. No commercial license fees—proprietary means closed-source binaries I can sell without drama.\n\nQuick Project Fit\n\n\\- Core Needs: Interactive 2D canvas for diagramming (drag-drop hierarchies, snapping/zooming), invoice gen (e.g., ReportLab in Python or PdfSharp in C#), SQLite for component catalogs.\n\n\\- Modern UI Goal: aim for Fluent/Material-inspired polish.\n\n\\- Deployment: Standalone .app/.exe bundles, no web bloat.\n\nCurrent Tilt: PySide\n\nIt checks every box—canvas strength, macOS native, Python scripting, easy modernity, and LGPL for sales—without the MVVM wall.

When code changes unexpectedly, you see the differences right in your git status; no test failures, just behavioral drift detection. Just add the decorator to any function, and execute `run-unittests`. It will redirect all the logs to a text file.\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nIt is a behavioral consistency framework that automatically captures both function logs and return values, storing them as organized text files that serve as behavioral baselines. Instead of traditional test assertions, it uses git diffs to show when function behavior changes unexpectedly during development. This lets you distinguish between intentional improvements and regressions, with built-in normalization filtering out noise like timestamps and memory addresses. \n\n**Target Audience**\n\nWe built for fast-moving startups and ML teams where constant experimentation happens but core functionality needs stability. It's perfect for environments where multiple developers iterate rapidly on shared codebases, and you want to encourage prototyping while catching behavioral drift. If you're in a startup where \"move fast and break things\" is the mantra but some things really shouldn't break, this provides the guardrails you need. We quickly catch bugs because we know exactly where to look when some log deviates.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nWhile pytest frameworks validate final results through explicit checks, difflogtest monitors the entire execution process: capturing logging, intermediate steps, and outputs for a complete behavioral picture. If you care more about how functions behave throughout execution rather than just final results, this gives you comprehensive monitoring without the test writing overhead. \n\nI'm not sure if this already exists, but for our use case we needed something like this and didn't find a good alternative. Happy to hear if someone knows of similar tools.",

    "content": "I'm sharing my project, the Home Security CCTV Monitor. \n\nThis is a real-time home surveillance tool that uses YOLOv8 for object detection and ChatGPT (or another AI API) as the “brains” to interpret what the camera sees.\n\nWhat My Project Does:\n\nThis system watches live video and classifies events into NORMAL, CAUTION, or THREAT. It’s designed to go beyond motion detection by interpreting behavior, not just presence.\n\nKey features:\n\n* YOLOv8 Object Detection: Detects people, cars, trucks, and more in real time.\n* Behavior Rules + AI Reasoning:\n   * Walking past on sidewalks → CAUTION\n   * Approaching the house/camera → THREAT\n   * Walking away → CAUTION\n   * Loitering near or interacting with cars → THREAT\n* AI Event Summaries: YOLO handles detection, ChatGPT interprets context and generates concise security-style logs.\n* Timeline Logging: Keeps memory of the last 10 alerts with status and short stories.\n* Snapshots: Automatic evidence images saved into a detections folder.\n* Tkinter GUI: Live video feed, status panel, and event log window.\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nThis is aimed at hobbyists, Python developers, and DIY security enthusiasts who want to explore computer vision + AI for real-world applications. It’s also useful for anyone curious about extending YOLO beyond raw detection into behavior-aware security.\n\nComparison:\n\nTraditional CCTV or motion detection cameras only capture footage. This project adds a reasoning layer: YOLOv8 detects, and ChatGPT classifies behaviors as normal, caution, or threat. It essentially gives the camera a way to “think” about what it sees.\n\nSource Code:  \nGitHub Repository: [https://github.com/xogie/Security-Camera-w-AI](https://github.com/xogie/Security-Camera-w-AI)",

    "content": "I need to write this of my chest, so to however wants to read this, here is my \"fuck my life\" moment as a python programmer for this week:\n\nI am happily refactoring a bunch of pytest-testcases for a work project. With this, my team decided to switch to explicitly import fixtures into each test-file instead of relying on them \"magically\" existing everywhere. Sounds like a good plan, makes things more explicit and easier to understand for newcomers. Initial testing looks good, everything works.\n\nI commit, the full testsuit runs over night. Next day I come back to most of the tests erroring out. Each one with a connection error. \"But that's impossible?\" We use a scope of session for your connection, there's only one connection for the whole testsuite run. There can be a couple of test running fine and than a bunch who get a connection error. How is the fixture re-connecting? I involve my team, nobody knows what the hecks going on here.\nSo I start digging into it, pytests docs usually suggest to import once in the `contest.py` but there is nothing suggesting other imports should't work.\n\nThan I get my Heureka: unter some obscure stack overflow post is a comment: _pytest resolves fixtures by their *full* import path, not just the symbol used in the file_. What? \n\nBut that's actually why non of the session-fixtures worked as expected. Each import statement creates a new fixture, each with a different import-path, even if they all look the same when used inside tests. Each one gets initialised seperatly and as they are scoped to the session, only destroyed at the end of the testsuite. Great... So back to global imports we went.\n\nI hope this helps some other tormented should and shortens the search for why pytest fixtures sometimes don't work as expected. Keep Coding!",

    "title": "PEP 806 – Mixed sync/async context managers with precise async marking",
    "content": "PEP 806 – Mixed sync/async context managers with precise async marking\n\n[https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/](https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/)\n\n# Abstract\n\nPython allows the `with` and `async with` statements to handle multiple context managers in a single statement, so long as they are all respectively synchronous or asynchronous. When mixing synchronous and asynchronous context managers, developers must use deeply nested statements or use risky workarounds such as overuse of [`AsyncExitStack`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.AsyncExitStack).\n\nWe therefore propose to allow `with` statements to accept both synchronous and asynchronous context managers in a single statement by prefixing individual async context managers with the `async` keyword.\n\nThis change eliminates unnecessary nesting, improves code readability, and improves ergonomics without making async code any less explicit.\n\n# Motivation\n\nModern Python applications frequently need to acquire multiple resources, via a mixture of synchronous and asynchronous context managers. While the all-sync or all-async cases permit a single statement with multiple context managers, mixing the two results in the “staircase of doom”:\n\n    async def process_data():\n        async with acquire_lock() as lock:\n            with temp_directory() as tmpdir:\n                async with connect_to_db(cache=tmpdir) as db:\n                    with open('config.json', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n                        # We're now 16 spaces deep before any actual logic\n                        config = json.load(f)\n                        await db.execute(config['query'])\n                        # ... more processing\n\nThis excessive indentation discourages use of context managers, despite their desirable semantics. See the [Rejected Ideas](https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/#rejected-ideas) section for current workarounds and commentary on their downsides.\n\nWith this PEP, the function could instead be written:\n\n    async def process_data():\n        with (\n            async acquire_lock() as lock,\n            temp_directory() as tmpdir,\n            async connect_to_db(cache=tmpdir) as db,\n            open('config.json', encoding='utf-8') as f,\n        ):\n            config = json.load(f)\n            await db.execute(config['query'])\n            # ... more processing\n\nThis compact alternative avoids forcing a new level of indentation on every switch between sync and async context managers. At the same time, it uses only existing keywords, distinguishing async code with the `async` keyword more precisely even than our current syntax.\n\nWe do not propose that the `async with` statement should ever be deprecated, and indeed advocate its continued use for single-line statements so that “async” is the first non-whitespace token of each line opening an async context manager.\n\nOur proposal nonetheless permits `with async some_ctx()`, valuing consistent syntax design over enforcement of a single code style which we expect will be handled by style guides, linters, formatters, etc. See [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0806/ban-single-line-with-async) for further discussion.",

    "title": "Pytrithon: Graphical Petri-Net Inspired Agent Oriented Programming Language Based On Python",
    "content": "# What My Project Does\nPytrithon is a graphical petri-net inspired agent oriented programming language based on Python. Do not worry, there is no need to understand formal petri-nets, the language instead is only inspired by them and is very simple and intuitive. Instead of a tree structure of linear code files, you have multiple Agents, each being a two dimensional graphical Pytri net, which cooperate with eachother. Pytrithon introduces native inter Agent communication into the core language as a first class member. You can directly model the actual control flow of an Agent which frees you from the strict linear recursive method calling of Python and enables many more modes of structuring the code. The Pytri nets you will create are very intuitive and readable, just by looking at them you can directly understand how the Agents operate, you don't need to browse the code as you do in plain Python and jump from file to file, method to method, desperately trying to reverse engineer how the code works. There are Places which store intermediate and global data and there are subtypes which express different use cases of variables, like queues and stacks. Pytrithon has many different Transitions, which are the actors of an Agent and are triggered by Places. The main Python Transition allows you to directly assign an arbitrary Python snippet as an action and allows for the powerful triggering of other parts of the Pytri net through supression. There also are different types of Tansitions which embody different kinds of intra Agent control flow, like an explicit if or switch, sending and receiving a signal, defining and using the Pytri net equivalent of a method, a Nethod. For inter Agent communication there are Transitions for sending and receiving arbitrary Python objects inbetween Agents, and the Task abstaction allows for an Agent to offer a service to other Agents which can be utilized as a single Transition on the caller's side. What makes a Pytri net so graspable is that all the control flow is apparent through explicit graphical Arcs, which connect Places to Transitions and hint at what follows what. Entire Pytri nets can be turned into Fragments and embedded into any Agent to modularize Pytrithon code. Ontology Concepts can be defined by stating their slots and are used to encapsulate data. One of Pytrithon's strengths is that you can monitor and manipulate Agents through the Monipulator, even during their execution, and can see the state of an Agent by viewing the contents of Places inside its Pytri net.\n# Target Audience\nPytrithon is for developers of all skill levels who want to try something new. Experienced Python programmers should value the new expressiveness it offers and know intuitively how to operate it. It is especially suited for Python beginners who want to kickstart into a much mightier language and want to learn about Agents communicating with one another on the fly. Pytrithon is an universal programming language which can be used for anything Python can be used for. It is suitable for quick prototyping, since you can directly embed GUI widgets into an Agent, but can also be used for more demanding and complex use cases, exemplified by TMWOTY2, a full Pygame game, which runs at 60 frames per second across 6 different Agents.\n# Why I Built It\nAt university I got introduced to a formal Petri net tool which was there used to learn about Petri nets and agent oriented programming, with which we implemented a Settlers game. I really enjoyed the expressiveness of Petri nets but found out that its formal nature made simple tasks very complicated. There were huge structures just to send data from one agent to another and you had to understand Petri nets in depth. I wanted something similar but way more intuitive and terse and adapted it into the Pytrithon language for more than 15 years now by rethinking how to integrate it deeply with Python.\n# Comparison\nNothing compares to Pytrithon, it is its very own thing. Most textual programming languages are based on linear files. Most graphical programming languages do not allow embedding arbitrary code and are just glorified parametrized flowcharts.\n# How To Explore\nAt least Python 3.10 is required to run all example Agents. The install script should install all required packages. Then you can run the pytrithon script to open up a Monipulator and check out the example Agents by hitting ctrl-o. If you prefer using the console, run 'python nexus -m &lt;agentname&gt;'. Recommended Agents to try are: \"basic\", \"calculator\", \"kniffel\", \"guess\", \"pokerserver\" + multiple \"poker\", \"chatserver\" + multiple \"chat\", \"image\", \"jobapplic\", and \"nethods\". There are also scripts for running and editing TMWOTY2. Your focus should be on the workbench folder, Pytrithon is just the backstage where the magic happens.\n# GitHub Link\nhttps://github.com/JochenSimon/pytrithon\n---\nWhen you give it a try, I would really appreciate feedback, because I have not had any yet, since I only recently found the courage to present it. I welcome being told of any problems when installing and running it, so that I can fix them and they do not bother people anymore. I would enjoy hearing your opinions and ideas for improvement, it would mean a lot to me if you explore several of the example Agents. I welcome any questions and would love to answer them.",

    "title": "Show r/Python: PyWebTransport – The canonical, async-native WebTransport stack for Python.",
    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm excited to share `PyWebTransport`, a modern, async-native networking library for Python. It's designed as a powerful alternative to WebSockets, leveraging the QUIC protocol to solve issues like head-of-line blocking and provide more versatile communication patterns.\n\nThe project is open-source, fully documented, and available on PyPI. It provides a high-level, asyncio-native API for the WebTransport protocol, allowing you to build high-performance, real-time network applications.\n\n### What My Project Does\n\n`PyWebTransport`'s main features include:\n\n- **Full Async Support**: Built from the ground up on asyncio for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.\n- **High-Level Frameworks**: Includes a ServerApp with routing and middleware, and a versatile WebTransportClient with helpers for pooling, auto-reconnection, and proxying.\n- **Advanced Messaging**: Built-in managers for Pub/Sub and RPC (JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant), plus pluggable serializers (`JSON`, `MsgPack`, `Protobuf`) for structured data.\n- **Complete Protocol Implementation**: Full support for bidirectional and unidirectional streams, as well as unreliable datagrams.\n- **Lifecycle and Resource Management**: Robust, async context-managed components for handling connections, sessions, streams, and monitoring.\n- **Event-Driven Architecture**: A powerful EventEmitter and EventBus system for decoupled, asynchronous communication between components.\n- **Type-Safe and Tested**: A fully type-annotated API with extensive test coverage (unit, integration, E2E) to ensure reliability and maintainability.\n\n### Target Audience\n\nThis library is intended for developers building **high-performance, real-time network applications** in Python.\n\nIt is designed with production use cases in mind. Features like robust resource management to prevent leaks, detailed statistics for monitoring, and the auto-reconnect client are all included to support stable, long-running services.\n\n### Comparison\n\nThe main alternative is WebSockets. `PyWebTransport` differs by leveraging QUIC to offer:\n\n- **No Head-of-Line Blocking**: Because it supports multiple, independent streams, a slow or large message on one stream doesn't block others.\n- **Unreliable Datagrams**: It provides a datagram API for sending low-latency, non-guaranteed messages, which WebSockets doesn't offer. This is ideal for things like real-time game state or voice data.\n- **Unidirectional Streams**: It supports write-only and read-only streams, which can be more efficient for certain application patterns, like a client sending a continuous stream of telemetry.\n\n### A Quick Look at the API\n\n#### Server (`server.py`)\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nfrom pywebtransport import (\n    ConnectionError,\n    ServerApp,\n    ServerConfig,\n    SessionError,\n    WebTransportSession,\n    WebTransportStream,\n)\nfrom pywebtransport.utils import generate_self_signed_cert\n\ngenerate_self_signed_cert(hostname=\"localhost\")\n\napp = ServerApp(\n    config=ServerConfig.create(\n        certfile=\"localhost.crt\",\n        keyfile=\"localhost.key\",\n        initial_max_data=1024 * 1024,\n        initial_max_streams_bidi=10,\n    )\n)\n\n\nasync def handle_datagrams(session: WebTransportSession) -&gt; None:\n    try:\n        datagram_transport = await session.datagrams\n        while True:\n            data = await datagram_transport.receive()\n            await datagram_transport.send(data=b\"ECHO: \" + data)\n    except (ConnectionError, SessionError, asyncio.CancelledError):\n        pass\n\n\nasync def handle_streams(session: WebTransportSession) -&gt; None:\n    try:\n        async for stream in session.incoming_streams():\n            if isinstance(stream, WebTransportStream):\n                data = await stream.read_all()\n                await stream.write_all(data=b\"ECHO: \" + data)\n    except (ConnectionError, SessionError, asyncio.CancelledError):\n        pass\n\n\n@app.route(path=\"/\")\nasync def echo_handler(session: WebTransportSession) -&gt; None:\n    datagram_task = asyncio.create_task(handle_datagrams(session))\n    stream_task = asyncio.create_task(handle_streams(session))\n    try:\n        await session.wait_closed()\n    finally:\n        datagram_task.cancel()\n        stream_task.cancel()\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=4433)\n\n```\n\n#### Client (`client.py`)\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport ssl\n\nfrom pywebtransport import ClientConfig, WebTransportClient\n\n\nasync def main() -&gt; None:\n    config = ClientConfig.create(\n        verify_mode=ssl.CERT_NONE,\n        initial_max_data=1024 * 1024,\n        initial_max_streams_bidi=10,\n    )\n\n    async with WebTransportClient(config=config) as client:\n        session = await client.connect(url=\"https://127.0.0.1:4433/\")\n\n        print(\"Connection established.

All feedback, suggestions, and contributions are welcome.\n\nWould love to hear feedback from anyone who’s tried experimenting with QUIC or WebTransport in Python.\n",

    "content": "Two years ago, as part of my Ph.D., I migrated some vectorized NumPy code to JAX to leverage the GPU and achieved a pretty good speedup (roughly 100x, based on how many experiments I could run in the same timeframe). Since third-party resources were quite limited at the time, I spent quite a bit of time time consulting the documentation and experimenting. I ended up creating a series of educational notebooks covering how to migrate from NumPy to JAX, core JAX features (admittedly highly opinionated), and real-world use cases with examples that demonstrate the core features discussed.\n\nThe material is designed for self-paced learning, so I thought it might be useful for at least one person here. I've presented it at some events for my university and at [PyCon 2025 - Speed Up Your Code by 50x: A Guide to Moving from NumPy to JAX](https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/54/). \n\nThe repository includes a series of standalone [exercises](https://github.com/IanQS/numpy_to_jax/tree/main/exercises) (with solutions in a separate folder) that introduce each concept with exercises that gradually build on themselves. There's also series of [case-studies](https://github.com/IanQS/numpy_to_jax/tree/main/case_studies) that demonstrate the practical applications with different algorithms.\n\nThe core functionality covered includes:\n\n- jit\n- loop-primitives\n- vmap\n- profiling\n- gradients + gradient manipulations\n- pytrees\n- einsum\n\nWhile the use-cases covers:\n\n- binary classification\n- gaussian mixture models\n- leaky integrate and fire\n- lotka-volterra\n\n---\n\nPlans for the future include 3d-tensor parallelism and maybe more real-world examplees\n",

    "title": "An Empirical Study of Type-Related Defects in Python Projects [pdf]",
    "content": "https://rebels.cs.uwaterloo.ca/papers/tse2021_khan.pdf\n\n**Abstract**: In recent years, Python has experienced an explosive growth in adoption, particularly among open source projects. While\nPython’s dynamically-typed nature provides developers with powerful programming abstractions, that same dynamic type system\nallows for type-related defects to accumulate in code bases. To aid in the early detection of type-related defects, type annotations were\nintroduced into the Python ecosystem (i.e., PEP-484) and static type checkers like mypy have appeared on the market. While\napplying a type checker like mypy can in theory help to catch type-related defects before they impact users, little is known about the\nreal impact of adopting a type checker to reveal defects in Python projects.\nIn this paper, we study the extent to which Python projects benefit from such type checking features. For this purpose, we mine the\nissue tracking and version control repositories of 210 Python projects on GitHub. Inspired by the work of Gao et al. on type-related\ndefects in JavaScript, we add type annotations to test whether mypy detects an error that would have helped developers to avoid real\ndefects. We observe that 15% of the defects could have been prevented by mypy. Moreover, we find that there is no significant\ndifference between the experience level of developers committing type-related defects and the experience of developers committing\ndefects that are not type-related. In addition, a manual analysis of the anti-patterns that most commonly lead to type-checking faults\nreveals that the redefinition of Python references, dynamic attribute initialization and incorrectly handled Null objects are the most\ncommon causes of type-related faults. Since our study is conducted on fixed public defects that have gone through code reviews and\nmultiple test cycles, these results represent a lower bound on the benefits of adopting a type checker. Therefore, we recommend\nincorporating a static type checker like mypy into the development workflow, as not only will it prevent type-related defects but also\nmitigate certain anti-patterns during development",

(Disclaimer: I volunteer for PyCon AU)\n\nThis year I'd recommend:\n\n1. [Lilly Ryan's \"Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Reality\"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1LRkAAUwbqHNGPBlxDkrz-3) - in which Lilly talks about how to get things done even though it's basically impossible to model the world correctly. \n\n2. [Benno Rice's \"Skill Issue\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND_SPnOynvg&amp;list=PLs4CJRBY5F1LRkAAUwbqHNGPBlxDkrz-3&amp;index=65) - in which Benno (of [The Tragedy of Systemd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_AIw9bGogo)) talks through his discomfort with ~~AI~~ Large Language Models and decides whether he's got valid reasons or if he's simply dislikes change. (Trust me this is not a talk about LLMs... mostly).\n\n3. [Dilpreet Singh's \"Beyond Vibes - Building Evals for Generative AI\"](https://youtu.be/sgpPhL15W10?si=KfHxhMNsbfU5lHgT) - Dilpreet talks through the steps he and his team have taken to build  evaluations of LLM outputs. \n\nI haven't had the chance to watch everything yet, and my time actually in talks was pretty limited this year, so I'm really looking forward to: \n\n1. [The Student Showcase](https://youtu.be/mqg93zv1S-E?si=ZrTkCcMNTy-2pmZl), [Lightning Talks 1](https://youtu.be/j1e9kF8uaNY?si=FI-g_O8ugvD2dxOk) and [Lightning Talks 2](https://youtu.be/Wl1CZTpWFEk?si=mPXnNDCdQYTcQk4q) - these are all the 'variety' talks that appeal to my attention span. The Student Showcase is almost always my favourite part of the conference, because of how cool the projects are and the fact that _these people are still in high school_.\n\n2. [Hailey Bartlett's \"Pinchy the Bestest Boi\"](https://youtu.be/Q2I7uJDIQhE?si=WQ5trjqvwHn8uDCu) - Pinchy robot!\n\n3. [Michaela Wheeler's \"High altitude balloon imagery decoding in the browser with C, JS, and Python\"](https://youtu.be/Xd1unoPzvgI?si=EY2zEZ0IZEsbAonT) - I don't know, this just sounds cool?\n\nKeen to hear what others find interesting here! \n\n(Also, I think I'd be remiss if I didn't mention [PyCon AU 2026](https://2026.pycon.org.au/) has already been announced in Brisbane next year and ticket sales are already open.

Other people suggest sticking with PyQt or switching to PySide, but they don’t feel as “modern” out of the box.\n\nHas anyone here gone through this recently? Should I:\n\n* Stick with PyQt/PySide and just modernize styles?\n* Use React with something like Tauri or a bridge to Python?\n* Look at other Python-native GUI frameworks?\n\nWould love to hear real-world experience with **long-term maintainability, performance, and packaging into a reliable EXE**.",

I think its main deficiency is not supporting async natively (it already has some functionalities but is still missing). While FastAPI, I see it more for small projects, applications that require async, such as data processing or AI in general. But for large projects (more than 30-40 endpoints), I think it is more complex to maintain in the long term.",

Done.\n* **Automatic unit selection:** It figures out whether your function is fast enough for µs or slow enough for seconds.\n* **Custom units &amp; precision:** Control decimals or force a specific unit.\n* **Works with async functions:** Because sometimes you want to time `async def` too.\n* **Exception-friendly:** Even if your function crashes, it still prints the time before propagating the error.\n\n**Usage:**\n\n    from timy_my_func import timeit, set_enabled\n    import time\n    \n    @timeit()\n    def fast_function():\n        sum(range(100))\n    \n    @timeit(decimals=5, unit=\"ms\")\n    def slow_function():\n        time.sleep(0.123)\n    \n    @timeit()\n    def disabled_function():\n      time.sleep(0.5)\n    \n    fast_function()\n    set_enabled(False)\n    disabled_function()\n    set_enabled(True)\n    slow_function()\n\n**Output:**\n\n    [fast_function] Execution time: 12.345 µs\n    [slow_function] Execution time: 123.45678 ms\n\n**Target Audience:**\n\n* Python developers who want **quick, convenient \"benchmarking**\" of functions without boilerplate code.\n* Great for **personal projects, experiments, small scripts**, or learning performance optimization.\n\n**Comparison**\n\n* **Manual** `time.perf_counter()`: Flexible, but verbose — you need multiple lines for each function, and it’s easy to forget to start/stop timers.\n* **Built-in** `timeit` **module**: Excellent for benchmarking snippets or loops, but awkward for timing full functions inline and printing results each time.\n* **Profiling tools (e.g., cProfile, line\\_profiler)**: Extremely detailed and powerful, but overkill if you just want a quick execution time. They also require setup and produce more output than most developers want for small tests.\n* **Other tiny timing utilities**: Often don’t support async functions or fail silently if an exception occurs. `timeitdecorator` handles both cleanly and prints results automatically.\n\nIt’s small, it’s silly, and it’s way easier than copying and pasting `start = time.perf_counter()`\n\n`print(...)` every time.\n\nCheck it out on GitHub: [https://github.com/DeathlyDestiny/function\\_timer](https://github.com/DeathlyDestiny/function_timer)\n\nOr just install using pip\n\n    pip install time-my-func",

If you switch to Optuna's GP sampler, ConfOpt still outperforms, but it's close if you only have numerical hyperparameters. It's still a big outperformance with categorical hyperparameters.\n\nI should also mention this all applies to single fidelity tuning. If you're a pro and you're tuning some massive LLM on multi-fidelity, I don't have benchmarks for you yet.\n\n**Want to learn more?**\n\nFor the serious stuff, you can find the preprint of my paper here: [https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.17051](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.17051)\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, please let me know in the comments!\n\n**Want to give it a try?** Check out the links below.\n\n* **Github Repository** (consider giving it a star!)**:** [https://github.com/rick12000/confopt](https://github.com/rick12000/confopt)\n* **Documentation:** [https://confopt.readthedocs.io/](https://confopt.readthedocs.io/)\n* **PyPI:** [https://pypi.org/project/confopt/](https://pypi.org/project/confopt/)\n\nInstall it with: `pip install confopt`",

It produces a single, lightweight HTML file you can open in any browser - **no Jupyter, no server.**\n\nIt renders directly from a compact JavaScript array, keeping file sizes small while still handling large datasets responsively. It also includes the latest ColumnControl component from DataTables, giving you flexible column visibility management out of the box.\n\n**Customization** \\- you can  configure DataTables options **directly from Python**\n\n**Target audience**  \nIt’s designed to embed seamlessly into popular web frameworks like Flask, Django, or FastAPI -  making it perfect for dashboards, admin panels, or lightweight data apps.\n\nThis can be useful for people who work with dataframes but don’t use Jupyter, or who want to share DataFrames as portable, interactive tables without extra setup.\n\nFor quick visual data exploration, it's easier to just enter text into the datatables search box, which searches in all text columns, than to build a filter in pandas (ColumnControl is even more convenient)\n\n**Comparison**  \nProjects like **itables** offer powerful Jupyter integration, but need Ipython and they rely on a notebook environment. `df2tables` is deliberately much smaller and simpler -  and the output is a fully standalone HTML file.\n\nRequires only `pandas` ***or*** `polars -` you don’t need both.\n\nBecause the output is plain HTML+JS, it’s trivial to embed these tables into any web framework (Flask, Django, FastAPI etc.), which makes it flexible.

    "content": "## What My Project Does\n\nI've put together **[StringWa.rs](http://github.com/ashvardanian/StringWa.rs)** — a benchmark suite for text and sequence processing in Python. It compares `str` and `bytes` built-ins, popular third-party libraries, and GPU/SIMD-accelerated backends on common tasks like splitting, sorting, hashing, and edit distances between pairs of strings.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nThis is for Python developers working with text processing at any scale — whether you're parsing config files, building NLP pipelines, or handling large-scale bioinformatics data. If you've ever wondered why your string operations are bottlenecking your application, or if you're still using packages like NLTK for basic string algorithms, this benchmark suite will show you exactly what performance you're leaving on the table.\n\n## Comparison\n\nMany developers still rely on outdated packages like `nltk` (with 38 M monthly downloads) for Levenshtein distances, not realizing the same computation can be **500× faster on a single CPU core** or up to **160,000× faster on a high-end GPU**. The benchmarks reveal massive performance differences across the ecosystem, from built-in Python methods to modern alternatives like my own **[StringZilla](https://github.com/ashvardanian/StringZilla/)** library (just released v4 under Apache 2.0 license after months of work).\n\nSome surprising findings for native `str` and `bytes`:\n* `str.find` is about **10×** slower than it can be\n* On 4 KB blocks, using `re.finditer` to match byte-sets is **46×** slower\n* On same inputs, `hash(str)` is **2×** slower and has lower quality\n* `bytes.translate` for binary transcoding is **4×** slower\n\nSimilar gaps exist in third-party libraries, like `jellyfish`, `google_crc32c`, `mmh3`, `pandas`, `pyarrow`, `polars`, and even Nvidia's own GPU-accelerated `cudf`, that (depending on the input) can be 100× slower than `stringzillas-cuda` on the same H100 GPU.\n\n---\n\nI recently wrote 2 articles about the new algorithms that went into the v4 release, that received some positive feedback on \"r/programming\" ([one](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nm3ath/processing_strings_109x_faster_than_nvidia_on_h100), [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1nmxdvf/how_a_string_library_beat_opencv_at_image)), so I thought it might be worth sharing the underlying project on \"r/python\" as well 🤗\n\nThis is in no way a final result, and there is a ton of work ahead, but let me know if I've overlooked important directions or libraries that should be included in the benchmarks!\n\nThanks, Ash!",

    "title": "Plot Twist: After Years of Compiling Python, I’m Now Using AI to Speed It Up",
    "content": "# My Journey with Python Performance Optimization: From Nuitka to AI-Powered Solutions\n\nHi everyone,\n\nThis post: [AI Python Compiler: Transpile Python to Golang with LLMs for 10x perf gain](https://discuss.python.org/t/ai-python-compiler-transpile-python-to-golang-with-llms-for-10x-perf-gain-pypi-like-service-to-host-transpiled-packages/103759) motivated me to share my own journey with Python performance optimization.\n\nAs someone who has been passionate about Python performance in various ways, it's fascinating to see the diverse approaches people take towards it. There's Cython, the Faster CPython project, mypyc, and closer to my heart, Nuitka.\n\nI started my OSS journey by contributing to Nuitka, mainly on the packaging side (support for third-party modules, their data files, and quirks), and eventually became a maintainer.\n\n## A bit about Nuitka and its approach\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Nuitka is a Python compiler that translates Python code to C++ and then compiles it to machine code. Unlike transpilers that target other high-level languages, Nuitka aims for 100% Python compatibility while delivering significant performance improvements.\n\nWhat makes Nuitka unique is its approach:\n\n- It performs whole-program optimization by analyzing your entire codebase and its dependencies\n- The generated C++ code mimics CPython's behavior closely, ensuring compatibility with even the trickiest Python features (metaclasses, dynamic imports, exec statements, etc.)\n- It can create standalone executables that bundle Python and all dependencies, making deployment much simpler\n- The optimization happens at multiple levels: from Python AST transformations to C++ compiler optimizations\n\nOne of the challenges I worked on was ensuring that complex packages with C extensions, data files, and dynamic loading mechanisms would work seamlessly when compiled. This meant diving deep into how packages like NumPy, SciPy, and various ML frameworks handle their binary dependencies and making sure Nuitka could properly detect and include them.\n\n## The AI angle\n\nNow, in my current role at [Codeflash](https://codeflash.ai), I'm tackling the performance problem from a completely different angle: using AI to rewrite Python code to be more performant.\n\nRather than compiling or transpiling, we're exploring how LLMs can identify performance bottlenecks and automatically rewrite code for better performance while keeping it in Python.\n\nThis goes beyond just algorithmic improvements - we're looking at:\n\n- Vectorization opportunities\n- Better use of NumPy/pandas operations\n- Eliminating redundant computations\n- Suggesting more performant libraries (like replacing `json` with `ujson` or `orjson`)\n- Leveraging built-in functions over custom implementations\n\nMy current focus is specifically on optimizing async code:\n- Identifying unnecessary awaits\n- Opportunities for concurrent execution with `asyncio.gather()`\n- Replacing synchronous libraries with their async counterparts\n- Fixing common async anti-patterns\n\nThe AI can spot patterns that humans might miss, like unnecessary list comprehensions that could be generator expressions, or loops that could be replaced with vectorized operations.\n\n## Thoughts on the evolution\n\nIt's interesting how the landscape has evolved from pure compilation approaches to AI-assisted optimization. Each approach has its trade-offs, and I'm curious to hear what others in the community think about these different paths to Python performance.\n\nWhat's your experience with Python performance optimization?\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nedit: thanks u/EmberQuill for making me aware of the markdown issue; this isn't LLM generated; I copied the content directly from [my DPO](https://discuss.python.org/t/plot-twist-after-years-of-compiling-python-im-now-using-ai-to-speed-it-up/103916) thread and it brought on the formatting, which I hadn't noticed",

    "content": "hi r/Python\n\nBack then, I often had to pull the plug on side projects built with Python, the hosting bills and upkeep just weren’t worth it. They ended up gathering dust on GitHub.\n\nThat’s why we created **Leapcell**: a platform designed so your Python ideas can stay alive without getting killed by costs in the early stage.\n\n**Deploy up to 20 Python websites or services for free (included in our free tier)**  \nMost PaaS platforms give you a single free VM (like the old Heroku model), but those machines often sit idle. Leapcell takes a different approach: with a serverless container architecture, we fully utilize compute resources and let you host multiple services simultaneously. While other platforms only let you run one free project, Leapcell lets you run up to **20 Python apps** for free.\n\nAnd it’s not just websites, your Python stack can include:\n\n* Web APIS: Django, Flask, FastAPI\n* Data &amp; automation: Playwright-based crawlers\n* APIs &amp; microservices: lightweight REST or GraphQL services\n\nWe were inspired by platforms like Vercel (multi-project hosting), but Leapcell goes further:\n\n* **Multi-language support:** Django, Node.js, Go, Rust.\n* **Two compute modes**\n   * ***Serverless***: cold start &lt; 250ms, autoscaling with traffic (perfect for early-stage Django apps).\n   * ***Dedicated machines***: predictable costs, no risk of runaway serverless bills, better unit pricing.\n* **Built-in stack:** PostgreSQL, Redis, async tasks, logging, and even web analytics out of the box.\n\nSo whether you’re running a Django blog, a Flask API, or a Playwright-powered scraper, you can start for free and only pay when you truly grow.\n\nIf you could host 20 Python projects for free today, what would you build first?",

Quests now auto generate quest to quest, evolving over time at checkpoints and be much more in depth overall. Giving chatters a better story, while also  allowing them multiple roll options with skill rolls tied into each class. (Things like barbarians are bad at thinking, but great at smashing! So they might not be the best at a stealth mission in a China shop...)   \n  \n2.) The bot now recognizes new chatters and greets them with fanfare and a little \"how to\" so they are not so confused when they first arrive. And the alert helps so I know they are a first time chatter!   \n  \n3.) I got all the skill rolls working, and now they are showing and updated in real time on the display. That way chatters can see at all times which skills are the best for this adventure they are on!   \n  \n4.) Bosses now display across the ENTIRE screen for the bot, being a big ol pain until they are defeated!  \n  \n5.) The druid weather effects now work, and have sounds on them (Some are very fun lol) and no longer spam repeats over and over.  \n  \n6.) Small bugs got fixed and many more popped up, so expect more updates soon(ish) \n\nYou can check it out when I'm live sometime [https://www.twitch.tv/thatturtlegm](https://www.twitch.tv/thatturtlegm)",

    "content": "# What My Project Does\n\n[`python-cq`](https://github.com/100nm/python-cq) is a package that helps apply CQRS principles (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) in async Python projects.\n\nThe core idea of CQRS is to separate:\n\n* **Commands** → actions that change the state of the system.\n* **Queries** → operations that only read data, without side effects.\n* **Events** → facts that describe something that happened, usually triggered by commands.\n\nWith `python-cq`, handlers for commands, queries, and events are just regular Python classes decorated with `@command_handler`, `@query_handler`, or `@event_handler`.\nThe framework automatically detects which message type is being handled based on type hints, no need to inherit from base classes or write boilerplate.\n\nIt also integrates with dependency injection through [`python-injection`](https://github.com/100nm/python-injection), which makes it easier to manage dependencies between handlers.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom injection import inject\nfrom cq import CommandBus, RelatedEvents, command_handler, event_handler\n\n@dataclass\nclass UserRegistrationCommand:\n    email: str\n    password: str\n\n@dataclass\nclass UserRegistered:\n    user_id: int\n    email: str\n\n@command_handler\nclass UserRegistrationHandler:\n    def __init__(self, events: RelatedEvents):\n        self.events = events\n\n    async def handle(self, command: UserRegistrationCommand):\n        \"\"\" register the user \"\"\"\n        user_id = ...\n        event = UserRegistered(user_id, command.email)\n        self.events.add(event)\n\n@event_handler\nclass SendConfirmationEmailHandler:\n    async def handle(self, event: UserRegistered):\n        \"\"\" send confirmation email \"\"\"\n\n@inject\nasync def main(bus: CommandBus[None]):\n    command = UserRegistrationCommand(email=\"root@gmail.com\", password=\"root\")\n    await bus.dispatch(command)\n```\n\n# Target Audience\n\nThis library is intended for developers who want to experiment with CQRS principles in async Python projects. I think the project could be production-ready, but I need more feedback to be certain.\n\nIf you’re interested in clean architecture, domain-driven design, or simply curious about alternative ways to structure Python code, this might be useful.\n\n# Comparison\n\nMost existing CQRS frameworks are designed for distributed systems or microservices, often bringing a lot of complexity with them.\n`python-cq` tries to stay different by being:\n\n* **Minimal**: just decorators, type annotations, and async.\n* **Local-first**: it works well for a single application.\n* **Integrated with DI**: works out of the box with `python-injection`.\n\nIt’s trying to provide a simple, Pythonic way to use CQRS ideas in async projects.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/100nm/python-cq",

    "title": "Lazy Ninja – Automate Django APIs &amp; Generate SDKs for Multiple Languages",
    "content": "# What My Project Does\n\nLazy Ninja is a Python library for Django that removes boilerplate from your APIs. It automatically generates CRUD endpoints from your Django models, creates Pydantic schemas for listing, creating, updating, and detailing records, and even generates SDKs/clients for multiple languages like TypeScript, Go and more.\n\nIt also comes with:\n\n* Async endpoints by default (configurable to sync if needed).\n* Interactive API documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc.\n* Smart filtering, sorting, and customizable hooks to add your own logic.\n\nWith Lazy Ninja, you can focus on building features instead of writing repetitive code or keeping frontend clients in sync.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nLazy Ninja is for developers building Django projects who want to save time on repetitive API work. It works great for internal tools, prototypes, or learning projects—and I hope that with community contributions, it will soon be fully ready for production use hahaha 🥺\n\nIf you’ve ever wished Django could handle the boring parts for you, Lazy Ninja can help.\n\n# Comparison\n\nCompared to using Django Ninja or DRF manually:\n\n* **Time-saving:** No need to write the same CRUD endpoints repeatedly.\n* **Multi-language SDK generation:** Clients for TypeScript, Dart, Python, Go, Java, C#, and more.\n* **Automatic Pydantic schema generation:** Eliminates errors from manually writing schemas.\n* **Better for async projects:** Designed to leverage Django’s async features seamlessly.\n\nIt’s not a replacement for Django Ninja or DRF—rather, it builds on top of them and removes repetitive tasks, making API development faster and more consistent.\n\n# Recent Updates / Highlights\n\n* **Project scaffolding:** Quickly start a new Django project with `lazy-ninja init` (includes [`api.py`](http://api.py) and minimal setup).\n* **SDK generation:** `lazy-ninja generate-client` now supports multiple languages from your backend schema, without running the server.\n* **UUID support:** If your models use UUID primary keys, Lazy Ninja now handles them correctly in CRUD routes.\n\n# Links\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/AghastyGD/lazy-ninja](https://github.com/AghastyGD/lazy-ninja)\n* Docs: [https://lazy-ninja.readthedocs.io](https://lazy-ninja.readthedocs.io)",

    "title": "Tines API Wrapper",
    "content": "**Links**\n\nPyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/Tapi/](https://pypi.org/project/Tapi/)  \nGitHub: [https://github.com/1Doomdie1/Tapi](https://github.com/1Doomdie1/Tapi)  \nPepy.tech: [stats](https://pepy.tech/projects/tapi?timeRange=threeMonths&amp;category=version&amp;includeCIDownloads=true&amp;granularity=daily&amp;viewType=line&amp;versions=0.1.3%2C0.1.2)\n\n**So what is Tines?**\n\nIn short, **Tines** is a no-code automation platform designed for security and IT teams. It allows users to build, orchestrate, and automate workflows such as incident response, threat detection, and IT operations without needing to write code. By connecting to APIs and tools, Tines helps streamline repetitive tasks, reduce response times, and improve operational efficiency. Althought it is marketed as a \"*no-code*\" solution, that doesn't mean it doesn't have the ability to run code. Quite the opposite, it provides you with a dedicated action which allows you to write and execute your own python code.\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nI created **Tapi** as a Python wrapper for the [Tines API](https://www.tines.com/api/welcome/). Rather than dealing with raw HTTP requests or parsing JSON by hand, Tapi provides structured classes like `WorkflowsAPI`, `ActionsAPI`, `CredentialsAPI`, and others. These give you a clean way to interact with your Tines tenant and its endpoints.\n\n**Examples**\n\nPulling information about your tenant would look somehting like this:\n\n    from json import dumps\n    from tapi import TenantAPI\n    \n    def main():\n        DOMAIN  = \"my-cool-domain-1234\"\n        API_KEY = \"do_not_put_this_on_github_lol\"\n        \n        tenant = TenantAPI(DOMAIN, API_KEY)\n        \n        tenant_info = tenant.info()\n        \n        print(dumps(tenant_info, indent = 4))\n\nOutput:\n\n    {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"stack\": {...}\n        },\n        \"headers\": {...},\n        \"status_code\": ...\n    }\n\nAnother example would be getting all the workflows from your tenant.\n\n    from json import dumps\n    from tapi import StoriesAPI\n    \n    def main():\n        DOMAIN  = \"my-cool-domain-1234\"\n        API_KEY = \"do_not_put_this_on_github_lol\"\n        \n        stories_api = StoriesAPI(DOMAIN, API_KEY)\n        \n        stories = stories_api.list()\n        \n        print(dumps(stories, indent = 4))\n\nOutput:\n\n    {\n        \"body\": {\n            \"stories\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"Testing\",\n                    \"user_id\": 1234,\n                    \"description\": null,\n                    \"keep_events_for\": 604800,\n                    \"disabled\": false,\n                    \"priority\": false\n                    //...[snip]...//\n                }\n            //...[snip]...//\n            ]\n        },\n        \"headers\": {...},\n        \"status_code\": ...\n    }\n\nAnd so on and so forth.

Open to **PySide6/Qt, .NET, or Tauri/Electron**.\n   2. **Licensing + accounts + payments** tied to **WordPress users** (trials, activations/deactivations, online check with offline grace, basic telemetry).\n* Prefer a **packaged/licensing platform** \\+ **subscription stack** that handles invoices/taxes (**Stripe+Woo**, **Paddle**, or **Lemon Squeezy**).\n* Must stay a desktop app; want **auto-update, code signing, crash reporting** if possible.\n* Looking for a **partner/contractor** or **battle-tested stack recommendations**.

The core engine is solid and runs as a **Windows desktop app** that integrates with **MetaTrader 5** via API. The current UI is a functional “builder” style interface, but it’s time to replace it with something professional—and, separately, I need to stand up the **licensing + accounts + payments** side. Ideally those two tracks don’t have to be tightly coupled.\n\n**What I need (two parallel tracks):**\n\n1. **UI replacement (desktop, Windows first)**\n\n* Re-skin/replace the current builder UI with a clean, professional desktop UI.\n* Keep it native-feeling and performant (I’m open on framework: PySide6/Qt, .NET wrapper, Tauri/Electron if justified, etc.).\n* Typical screens: multi-tab layout (Live, Backtest, Config), tables/logs, charts, start/stop controls, settings, license/status panel.\n* Nice to have: light/dark themes, responsive layout, error toasts, and a safe auto-update flow.\n\n1. **Licensing + website accounts + payments (WordPress)**\n\n* Users already have/will have **WordPress accounts** on my site.\n* I want **licenses tied to website accounts** (plan-based, per-seat/per-machine), with:\n   * trials, activations/deactivations,\n   * online verification with a short offline grace window,\n   * basic telemetry/heartbeat is fine if needed.\n* **Payments &amp; accounting:** looking for an off-the-shelf subscription stack that handles invoicing, taxes (Canada GST/HST), refunds, and proration.\n   * I’m open to options like Stripe (+ WooCommerce/membership), Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, etc.—whichever is the least painful and plays nicely with WordPress and a license server.\n* Bonus: code signing for Windows builds, crash reporting, and a straightforward release pipeline.\n\n**Key constraints &amp; reality check**\n\n* This **must remain a desktop app** (tight MT5 integration).\n* I don’t have the bandwidth to build licensing/commerce from scratch. A **packaged platform or proven combo** is preferred.\n* I’m aiming to **decouple** the UI rebuild from the licensing/commerce work so either can ship independently.\n\n**What I bring**\n\n* Fully working trading engine with clear boundaries between logic and UI.\n* Test builds and sample data for quick iteration.\n* Fast feedback cycles and a pragmatic scope (ship the essentials first).\n\n**What I’m looking for**\n\n* Either: (a) a **partner/contractor** who can take one or both tracks, or (b) **recommendations** for a licensing+commerce setup that fits a WordPress site and a Python/Windows desktop app.\n* War stories welcome: gotchas with Paddle/Lemon Squeezy/Stripe+Woo, WordPress SSO flows into a desktop client, license server choices, updater tooling, and code signing tips.\n\nIf you’re interested (or have a battle-tested stack to recommend), please drop a comment or DM me with:\n\n* Relevant examples (UI rebuilds, licensing integrations).\n* Your preferred stack and why.\n* Rough timeline/engagement model.\n\n\n\nMe again. This isn't a time sensitive project. Just something I have been building for fun that actually turned into some violently complicated.\n\nCheers,\n\n",

    "content": "The `Sequence` ABC from collections.abc does not include an abstract method copy(). What are the reasons for that design choice?\n\nNote that I am *not* asking how to work with that design choice. Instead I am trying to understand it.\n\n## Update\n\nThere have been great comments helping to answer (or even unask) the question. What I found most compelling is the observation (that I needed pointed out to me) that `copy` is problematic for a number reasons.\n\nPeople drew attention to this discussion of adding copy to `Set`:\n\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue22101\n\n### copy return type\n\nThere are two arguments against adding copy to Set. One is that depending on the backing of the data copy might be inappropriate. The other is that the return type of copy is unclear. As Guido says, \n\n&gt; I personally despise almost all uses of \"copying\" (including the entire copy module, both deep and shallow copy functionality).  I much prefer to write e.g. list(x) over x.copy() -- when I say list(x) I know the type of the result.\n\nI had not thought of that before, but once stated, I completely agree with it.\nI am no longer thinking about creating a `CopiableSequence` protocol. If I have a concrete class for which `copy` makes sense and has clear semantics, I might add concrete a concrete method, but even then, I would probably probably create something like\n\n```python\nMyConcreteSequence[T](Sequence[T]):\n   def mutable_copy(self) -&gt; list[T]:\n      ...  # actual implementation would go here.\n```\n\nbut I don't really foresee needing to do that.\n\n### Keep the \"Base\" in ABC\n\nThe other line of answer was effectively about how basic a base class is expected to be. These really should be the minimal description of what makes something conform to the ABC. I find that a good and principled argument, but then I am left with why `reversed()` is included in `Sequence`.\n\nSo I come back to thinking that the relevant difference between `reversed()` and `copy()` for an immutable thing like Sequence is about deciding what the return type of `copy()` should be.\n\n#### Update (again)\n\nMy initial sense that implementing `copy` would depend on the same underlying properties of the data in the same way that implementing `reversed` would was mistaken. I learned a great deal in the discussion, and I encourage others to read it.\n\n\n",

    "content": "I've been working on this reactive state management library for Python, and I'm excited to share that I just added LinkedSignals in v0.19.2. But first, let me explain what this whole \"Signals\" thing is about.\n\n# I built Signals = Excel for your Python code\n\nYou know that frustrating bug where you update some data but forget to refresh the UI? Or where you change one piece of state and suddenly everything is inconsistent? **I got tired of those bugs, so I built something that eliminates them completely.**\n\nSignals work just like Excel - change one cell, and all dependent formulas automatically recalculate:\n\n    from reaktiv import Signal, Computed, Effect\n    \n    # Your data (like Excel cells)\n    name = Signal(\"Alice\")\n    age = Signal(25)\n    \n    # Automatic formulas (like Excel =A1&amp;\" is \"&amp;B1&amp;\" years old\")\n    greeting = Computed(lambda: f\"{name()} is {age()} years old\")\n    \n    # Auto-display (like Excel charts that update automatically)\n    display = Effect(lambda: print(greeting()))\n    # Prints: \"Alice is 25 years old\"\n    \n    # Just change the data - everything updates automatically!\n    name.set(\"Bob\")  # Prints: \"Bob is 25 years old\"\n    age.set(30)      # Prints: \"Bob is 30 years old\"\n\n**No more forgotten updates. No more inconsistent state. It just works.**\n\n# What I just added: LinkedSignals\n\nThe big feature I'm excited about in v0.19.2 is **LinkedSignals** \\- for when you want a value that usually follows a formula, but users can override it temporarily:\n\n    from reaktiv import Signal, Computed, LinkedSignal\n    \n    # Items from your API\n    items = Signal([\"iPhone\", \"Samsung\", \"Google Pixel\"])\n    \n    # Selection that defaults to first item but remembers user choice\n    selected = LinkedSignal(lambda: items()[0] if items() else None)\n    \n    print(selected())  # \"iPhone\"\n    \n    # User picks something\n    selected.set(\"Samsung\") \n    print(selected())  # \"Samsung\"\n    \n    # API updates - smart behavior!\n    items.set([\"Samsung\", \"OnePlus\", \"Nothing Phone\"])\n    print(selected())  # Still \"Samsung\" (preserved!)\n    \n    # But resets when their choice is gone\n    items.set([\"OnePlus\", \"Nothing Phone\"])\n    print(selected())  # \"OnePlus\" (smart fallback)\n\n**I built this for:**\n\n* Search/filter UIs where selections should survive data refreshes\n* Pagination that clamps to valid pages automatically\n* Form defaults that adapt but remember user input\n* Any \"smart defaulting\" scenario\n\n# Why I think this matters\n\nThe traditional approach:\n\n    # Update data ✓\n    # Remember to update display (bug!)  \n    # Remember to validate selection (bug!)\n    # Remember to update related calculations (bug!)\n\nSo I built something where you declare relationships once:\n\n    # Declare what depends on what\n    # Everything else happens automatically ✓\n\nI borrowed this battle-tested pattern from frontend frameworks (Angular, SolidJS) and brought it to Python. Perfect for APIs, data processing, configuration management, or any app where data flows through your system.\n\nTry it out: `pip install reaktiv` (now v0.19.2!)\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv) | [Docs](https://reaktiv.readthedocs.io) | [Examples](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv/tree/main/examples) | [Playground](https://reaktiv.bui.app/#interactive-demo)\n\nWould love to hear what you think or if you build something cool with it!",

    "title": "Python Context Managers 101",
    "content": "You've likely seen it before: The `with` keyword, which is one way of using Python context managers, such as in this File I/O example below:\n\n```python\nwith open('my_file.txt', 'r') as f:\n    content = f.read()\n    print(content)\n```\n\nPython context managers provide a way to wrap code blocks with setUp and tearDown code that runs before and after the code block. This tearDown part can be useful for multiple reasons, such as freeing up resources that have been allocated, closing files that are no longer being read from (or written to), and even quitting browsers that were spun up for automated testing.\n\nCreating them is simple. Let's create a simple context manager that displays the runtime of a code block:\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\n\n@contextmanager\ndef print_runtime(description=\"Code block\"):\n    start_time = time.time()\n    try:\n        yield\n    finally:\n        runtime = time.time() - start_time\n        print(f\"{description} ran for {runtime:.4f}s.\")\n```\n\nHere's how you could use it as a method decorator:\n\n```python\n@print_runtime()\ndef my_function():\n    # &lt;CODE BLOCK&gt;\n\nmy_function()\n```\n\nHere's how you could use it within a function using the `with` keyword:\n\n```python\nwith print_runtime():\n    # &lt;CODE BLOCK&gt;\n```\n\nAnd here's a low-level way to use it without the `with` keyword:\n\n```python\nmy_context = print_runtime()\nmy_object = my_context.__enter__()\n# &lt;CODE BLOCK&gt;\nmy_context.__exit__(None, None, None)\n```\n\nAs you can see, it's easy to create and use Python context managers. You can even pass args into them when configured for that. In advanced scenarios, you might even use context managers for browser automation. Example:\n\n```python\nfrom seleniumbase import SB\n\nwith SB(incognito=True, demo=True, test=True) as sb:\n    sb.open(\"https://www.saucedemo.com\")\n    sb.type(\"#user-name\", \"standard_user\")\n    sb.type(\"#password\", \"secret_sauce\")\n    sb.click(\"#login-button\")\n    sb.click('button[name*=\"backpack\"]')\n    sb.click(\"#shopping_cart_container a\")\n    sb.assert_text(\"Backpack\", \"div.cart_item\")\n```\n\nThat was a simple example of testing an e-commerce site. There were a few args passed into the context manager on initialization, such as `incognito` for Chrome's Incognito Mode, `demo` to highlight browser actions, and `test` to display additional info for testing, such as runtime.\n\nWhether you're looking to do simple File I/O, or more advanced things such as browser automation, Python context managers can be extremely useful!",

    "title": "enso: A functional programming framework for Python",
    "content": "Hello all, I'm here to make my first post and 'release' of my functional programming framework, enso.  Right before I made this post, I made the repository public.  You can find it [here.](https://gitlab.com/evansemenoff/enso)\n\n# What my project does\n\nenso is a high-level functional framework that works over top of Python.  It expands the existing Python syntax by adding a variety of features.  It does so by altering the AST at runtime, expanding the functionality of a handful of built-in classes, and using a modified tokenizer which adds additional tokens for a preprocessing/translation step.\n\nI'll go over a few of the basic features so that people can get a taste of what you can do with it.\n\n1. Automatically curried functions!\n\nHow about the function add, which looks like\n\n    def add(x:a, y:a) -&gt; a:\n        return x + y\n\nUnlike normal Python, where you would need to call add with 2 arguments, you can call this `add` with only one argument, and then call it with the other argument later, like so:\n\n    f = add(2)\n    f(2)\n    4\n\n2. A map operator\n\nSince functions are automatically curried, this makes them really, really easy to use with `map`.  Fortunately, enso has a map operator, much like Haskell.\n\n    f &lt;$&gt; [1,2,3]\n    [3, 4, 5]\n\n3. Predicate functions\n\nFunctions that return `Bool` work a little differently than normal functions.  They are able to use the pipe operator to filter iterables:\n\n    even? | [1,2,3,4]\n    [2, 4]\n\n4. Function composition\n\nThere are a variety of ways that functions can be composed in enso, the most common one is your typical function composition.\n\n    h = add(2) @ mul(2)\n    h(3)\n    8\n\nAdditionally, you can take the *direct sum* of 2 functions:\n\n    h = add + mul\n    h(1,2,3,4)\n    (3, 12)\n\nAnd these are just a few of the ways in which you can combine functions in enso.\n\n5. Macros\n\nenso has a variety of macro styles, allowing you to redefine the syntax on the file, adding new operators, regex based macros, or even complex syntax operations.  For example, in the REPL, you can add a `zip` operator like so:\n\n    macro(op(\"-=-\", zip))\n    [1,2,3] -=- [4,5,6]\n    [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]\n\nThis is just one style of macro that you can add, see the readme in the project for more.\n\n6. Monads, more new operators, new methods on existing classes, tons of useful functions, automatically derived function 'variants', and loads of other features made to make writing code fun, ergonomic and aesthetic.\n\nAbove is just a small taster of the features I've added.  The README file in the repo goes over a lot more.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nWhat I'm hoping is that people will enjoy this.  I've been working on it for awhile, and dogfooding my own work by writing several programs in it.  My own smart-home software is written entirely in *enso.*  I'm really happy to be able to share what is essentially a beta version of it, and would be super happy if people were interested in contributing, or even just using enso and filing bug reports.  My long shot goal is that one day I will write a proper compiler for enso, and either self-host it as its own language, or run it on something like LLVM and avoid some of the performance issues from Python, as well as some of the sticky parts which have been a little harder to work with.\n\nI will post this to r/functionalprogramming once I have obtained enough karma.\n\nHappy coding.",

    "title": "Pure Python Cryptographic Commitment Scheme: General Purpose, Offline-Capable, Zero Dependencies",
    "content": "Hello everyone, I have created a cryptographic commitment scheme that is universally applicable to any computer running python, it provides cryptographic security to any average coder just by copy and pasting the code module I curated below, it has many use cases and has never been available/accessible until now according to GPT deep search. My original intent was to create a verifiable psi experiment, then it turned into a universally applicable cryptographic commitment module code that can be used and applied by anyone at this second from the GitHub repository.\n\nLmk what ya’ll think?\n\nChatGPT’s description: This post introduces a minimal cryptographic commitment scheme written in pure Python. It relies exclusively on the Python standard library. No frameworks, packages, or external dependencies are required. The design goal was to make secure commitment–reveal verification universally usable, auditably simple, and deployable on any system that runs Python.\n\nThe module uses HMAC-SHA256 with domain separation and random per-instance keys. The resulting commitment string can later be verified against a revealed key and message, enabling proof-of-prior-knowledge, tamper-evident disclosures, and anonymous timestamping.\n\n⸻\n\nRepositories:\n\n•\tMinimal module: https://github.com/RayanOgh/Minimal-HMAC-SHA256-Commitment-Verification-Skeleton-Python-\n\n•\tExtended module with logging/timestamping: https://github.com/RayanOgh/Remote-viewing-commitment-scheme\n\n⸻\n\nCore Capabilities: •\tHMAC-SHA256 cryptographic commitment\n\n•\tDomain separation using a contextual prefix\n\n•\t32-byte key generation using os.urandom\n\n•\tDeterministic, tamper-evident output\n\n•\tConstant-time comparison via hmac.compare_digest\n\n•\tCanonicalization option for message normalization\n\n•\tFully offline operation\n\n•\tExecutable in restricted environments\n\n⸻\n\nApplications:\n\n1.\t⁠Scientific Pre-Registration •\tCommit to experimental hypotheses or outputs before public release\n2.\t⁠Anonymous Proof-of-Authorship •\tTime-lock or hash-lock messages without revealing them until desired\n3.\t⁠Decentralized Accountability •\tEnable individuals or groups to prove intent, statements, or evidence at a later time\n4.\t⁠Censorship Resistance •\tContent sealed offline can be later verified despite network interference\n5.\t⁠Digital Self-Testimony •\tIndividuals can seal claims about future events, actions, or beliefs for later validation\n6.\t⁠Secure Collaborative Coordination •\tPrevent cheating in decision processes that require asynchronous commitment and later reveal\n7.\t⁠Education in Applied Cryptography •\tTeaches secure commitment schemes with no prerequisite tooling\n8.\t⁠Blockchain-Adjacent Use •\tWorks as an off-chain oracle verification mechanism or as a pre-commitment protocol\n\n⸻\n\nDesign Philosophy:\n\nThe code does not represent innovation in algorithm design. It is a structural innovation in distribution, accessibility, and real-world usability. It converts high-trust commitment protocols into direct, deployable, offline-usable infrastructure. All functionality is transparent and auditable. Because it avoids dependency on complex libraries or hosted backends, it is portable across both privileged and under-resourced environments.\n\n⸻\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis module allows anyone to generate cryptographic proofs of statements, events, or data without needing a company, a blockchain, or a third-party platform. The source code is auditable, adaptable, and already functioning. It is general-purpose digital infrastructure for public verifiability and personal integrity.\n\nUse cases are active. Implementation is immediate. The code is already working.",

And as mentioned, NYTGames runs the official game on their website, but currently their site doesn't provide an archive or more than 3 daily puzzles to do.\n\n**What My Project Does:**  \nMy intention was to implement backtracking and BFS to solve this like it was a Leetcode problem: backtracking to recursively place dominoes, and BFS to look for all connected tiles with the same constraint.  \nThe average time to solve a puzzle is 0.059 seconds, although there are some puzzles I've encountered- taking entire minutes- that I need to optimize the algorithm for.\n\nAny suggestions/feedback are appreciated, and I've provided my GitHub link if anyone wants to contribute! In the future, I'm hoping to also build a puzzle generator and flesh out this repository as a playable terminal game.\n\n**LINKS:**  \nGitHub Link: [https://github.com/ematth/pips](https://github.com/ematth/pips)",

All on the same single machine. Although I don’t anticipate significant user growth/increased load, the platform has gained traction among clients, and I’m now looking to optimize the infrastructure for reliability and maintainability. In essence to safe time and for peace of mind. It does not generate too much revenue, so i would only be able to afford around 25-50 dollars per month for everything.\n\nMy goal is to simplify infrastructure management without incurring high costs—ideally with a setup that’s secure, easy to operate, and resilient. A key priority is implementing continuous database backups, preferably stored on a separate system to safeguard against data loss.",

    "title": "prob_conf_mat - Statistical inference for classification experiments and confusion matrices",
    "content": "[`prob_conf_mat`](https://github.com/ioverho/prob_conf_mat) is a library I wrote to support my statistical analysis of classification experiments. It's now at the point where I'd like to get some external feedback, and before sharing it with its intended audience, I was hoping some interested r/Python users might want to take a look first.\n\nThis is the first time I've ever written code with others in mind, and this project required learning many new tools and techniques (e.g., unit testing, Github actions, type checking, pre-commit checks, etc.). I'm very curious to hear whether I've implemented these correctly, and generally I'd love to get some feedback on the readability of the documentation.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to ask any questions; I'll respond as soon as I can.\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nWhen running a classification experiment, we typically evaluate a classification model's performance by evaluating it on some held-out data. This produces a [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix), which is a tabulation of which class the model predicts when presented with an example from some class. Since confusion matrices are hard to read, we usually summarize them using classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1, MCC). If the metric achieved by our model is better than the value achieved by another model, we conclude that our model is better than the alternative.\n\nWhile very common, this framework ignores a lot of information. There's no accounting for the amount of uncertainty in the data, for sample sizes, for different experiments, or for the size of the difference between metric scores.\n\nThis is where [`prob_conf_mat`](https://github.com/ioverho/prob_conf_mat) comes in. It quantifies the uncertainty in the experiment, it allows users to combine different experiments into one, and it enables statistical significance testing. Broadly, theit does this by sampling many plausible counterfactual confusion matrices, and computes metrics over all confusion matrices to produce a distribution of metric values. In short, with very little additional effort, it enables rich statistical inferences about your classification experiment.\n\n# Example\n\nSo instead of doing:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; import sklearn\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; sklearn.metrics.f1_score(model_a_y_true, model_a_y_pred, average=\"macro\")\n    0.75\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; sklearn.metrics.f1_score(model_b_y_true, model_a_b_pred, average=\"macro\")\n    0.66\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; 0.75 &gt; 0.66\n    True\n\nNow you can do:\n\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; import prob_conf_mat\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; study = prob_conf_mat.Study()        # Initialize a Study\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; study.add_experiment(\"model_a\", ...) # Add data from model a\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; study.add_experiment(\"model_b\", ...) # Add data from model b\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; study.add_metric(\"f1@macro\", ...)    # Add a metric to compare them\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; study.plot_pairwise_comparison(      # Compare the experiments\n        metric=\"f1@macro\",\n        experiment_a=\"model_a\",\n        experiment_b=\"model_b\",\n        min_sig_diff=0.005,\n    )\n\n[Example difference distribution figure](https://github.com/ioverho/prob_conf_mat/raw/main/documentation/assets/figures/readme/comparison_plot.svg)\n\nNow you can tell how probable it is that \\`model\\_a\\` is actually better, and whether this difference is statistically significant or not.\n\nThe ['Getting Started' chapter of the documentation](https://www.ivoverhoeven.nl/prob_conf_mat/Getting%20Started/index.html) has a lot more examples.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nThis was built for anyone who produces confusion matrices and wants to analyze them. I expect that it will mostly be interesting for those in academia: scientists, students, statisticians and the like. The documentation is hopefully readable for anyone with some machine-learning/statistics background.\n\n# Comparison\n\nThere are many, many excellent Python libraries that handle confusion matrices, and compute classification metrics (e.g., [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_confusion_matrix.html), [`TorchMetrics`](https://lightning.ai/docs/torchmetrics/stable/), [`PyCM`](https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/pycm), *inter alia*).\n\nThe most famous of these is probably `scikit-learn`. `prob-conf-mat` implements all metrics currently in `scikit-learn` (plus some more) and tests against these to ensure equivalence. We also enable class averaging for all metrics through a single interface.\n\nFor the statistical inference portion (i.e., what sets `prob_conf_mat` apart), to the best of my knowledge, there are no viable alternatives.\n\n# Design &amp; Implementation\n\nMy primary motivation for this project was to learn, and because of that, **I do not** **use AI tools**. Going forward this might change (although minimally).\n\n# Links\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/ioverho/prob\\_conf\\_mat](https://github.com/ioverho/prob_conf_mat)\n\nHomepage: [https://www.ivoverhoeven.nl/prob\\_conf\\_mat/](https://www.ivoverhoeven.nl/prob_conf_mat/)\n\nPyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/prob-conf-mat/](https://pypi.org/project/prob-conf-mat/)",

So it already has a lot of exposure to real world development.\n\nWhen I first reviewed the tool I found a couple of bugs and they were both fixed within a few hours of reporting them. Since then I've enthusiastically adopted prek, largely because while pre-commit is stable it is very stagnant, the pre-commit author actively blocks suggesting using new packaging standards, so I am excited to see competition in this space.",

    "content": "Hey r/Python,\n\nWe've been experimenting with how to make Python deployment easier and would love your thoughts.\n\nAfter building Shuttle for Rust, we're exploring whether the same patterns work well in Python.\n\nWe built [Shuttle Cobra](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-cobra), a Python framework that lets you define AWS infrastructure using Python decorators and then using the Shuttle CLI `shuttle deploy` to deploy your code to your own AWS account.\n\nHere's what it looks like:\n\n    from typing import Annotated\n    from shuttle_aws.s3 import AllowWrite\n    \n    TABLE = \"record_counts\"\n    \n    @shuttle_task.cron(\"0 * * * *\")\n    async def run(\n        bucket: Annotated[\n            Bucket,\n            BucketOptions(\n                bucket_name=\"grafana-exporter-1234abcd\",\n                policies=[\n                    AllowWrite(account_id=\"842910673255\", role_name=\"SessionTrackerService\")\n                ]\n            )\n        ],\n        db: Annotated[RdsPostgres, RdsPostgresOptions()],\n    ):\n        # ...\n\nThe goal is simplicity and ease of use, we want developers to focus on writing application code than managing infra. The CLI reads your type hints to understand what AWS resources you need, then generates CloudFormation templates automatically and deploys to your own AWS account. You will still be using the official AWS libraries so migration will be seamless by just adding a few lines of code.\n\nRight now the framework is only focused on Python CRON jobs but planning to expand to other use cases.\n\nWe're looking for honest feedback on a few things. Does this approach feel natural in Python, or does it seem forced? How does this compare to your current deployment workflow? Is migration to this approach easy? What other AWS resources would be most useful to have supported? Do you have any concerns about mixing infrastructure definitions with application code?\n\nThis is experimental - we're trying to understand if IfC patterns that work well in Rust translate effectively to Python. The Python deployment ecosystem already has great tools, so we want to know if this adds value or just complexity.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [Full Article](https://www.shuttle.dev/blog/2025/09/18/introducing-shuttle-cobra?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=shuttle_cobra_launch)\n* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-cobra)\n* [Shuttle Cobra Docs](https://docs.cobra.shuttle.dev/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=python_cobra_feedback)\n\nThanks for any feedback - positive or negative. Trying to understand if this direction makes sense for the Python community.",

If libraries are not found, an online search is performed on pypi. If several candidates are available, a selection menu appears where you must choose the appropriate one. For example, opencv: the import is: import cv2, and the installation package is called opencv-python.\n\nOnce you've imported the history, the PC does a little calculation and you get either a single exe file containing everything, as selected, or a folder structure that looks like this:\n\nFolder\n\n\\-- pgmdata/\n\n\\-- python/\n\n\\-- myProgram.exe\n\n\n\nYou can now distribute the exe or folder to any computer and start it. So you don't have to install anything, nor does anything change on the system.\n\n  \n\n\nNow to my question: Is this even a thing anymore these days? I mean, before I go to the trouble of polishing it all up and uploading it to GitHub. Tools like cxfreeze and py2exe have been around forever, but will they even still be used in 2025? ",

Simply tracing the methods and imports in a relevant file or two is too limited when we have projects with hundreds of files and 100k+ LOC.\n\nI built and launched tenets, a CLI and library to gather the right files and context automatically for your LLM prompts, living at [https://tenets.dev](https://tenets.dev/), or [https://github.com/jddunn/tenets](https://github.com/jddunn/tenets) for the direct source. Install with one command:\n\n`pip install tenets`\n\nand run:\n\n`tenets distill \"fix my bugs in the rest API authentication\"`\n\nsomewhere and you'll get the most important file and their contents relevant to your prompt, optimized to fit into token budgets and summarized smartly (like imports being condensed or non-important functions truncated) as needed.\n\nYou can run the same command:\n\n`tenets rank \"fix my bugs in the rest API authentication\"`\n\nand you'll get a list of files (at a much faster speed) on their own. Think of tenets like repomix on steroids, all automatic (no manual searches) with deterministic NLP analysis like BM25 and optional semantic understandings with embeddings.\n\nWith tenets you also get code intelligence and optional visualization tools to measure metrics, velocity, and evolution of your codebase over time, with outputs in SVG, PNG, JSON, and HTML.\n\n**Target Audience** \n\nI built this out as a tool for personal needs that I think will have value not just for users but potential programmatic usage in coding assistants; as such, tenets has a well-documented API (https://tenets.dev/latest/api/).\n\n**Comparison** \n\nProjects like repomix aggregate files with manual selection. I don't know of many other libraries with the same design goals and intentions as tenets.",

Prompture takes the same idea but makes it universal: you’re not locked into one ecosystem, the outputs are validated against your schema, and you get cost + usage stats built in. For me it’s been a huge upgrade in terms of reliability and testing across providers.\n\n📂 GitHub: [https://github.com/jhd3197/Prompture](https://github.com/jhd3197/Prompture)  \n🌍 PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/prompture/](https://pypi.org/project/prompture/)\n\nWould love feedback, suggestions, or ideas for features you'd like to see! 🙌 And hey… don’t forget to ⭐ if you find it useful ✨",

Experts probably won’t find it very useful, but maybe it can help people starting out.\n\nComparison: To my knowledge, most existing libraries handle preprocessing well, but they don’t directly give reports/plots.

This platform would allow smaller dev teams to click-to-deploy small-medium sized programs, scripts, web apps, etc. to the cloud from a Github repository. The frontend will consist of a portal to select the program you want to run and then route to that specific page to execute it. Features I am looking into are:\n\n* centralized sharing gives non-tech users an easier way to access all the tools in one location (no more siloed notebooks, scripts, and web app URLs)\n* one-click edits/deploys (git push = updated application in cloud)\n* execution logs + observability at the user level -&gt; dev(s) can see the exact error logs + I/Os \n* secure SSO (integration with both azure and gcp)\n* usage analytics\n\nI'm wondering if this would be useful for others / what features you would like to see in it!

    "content": "Python's dominance in AI/ML is undeniable, but after building several production AI systems, I've learned that the language choice is just the beginning. The real challenges are in architecture, deployment, and scaling.\n\n**Current project:** Multi-agent system processing 100k+ documents daily  \n**Stack:** FastAPI, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker  \n**Scale:** \\~50 concurrent AI workflows, 1M+ API calls/month\n\n**What's working well:**\n\n* **FastAPI for API development** – async support handles concurrent AI calls beautifully\n* **Celery for background processing** – essential for long-running AI tasks\n* **Pydantic for data validation** – catches errors before they hit expensive AI models\n* **Rich ecosystem** – libraries like LangChain, Transformers, and OpenAI client make development fast\n\n**Pain points I've encountered:**\n\n* **Memory management** – AI models are memory-hungry, garbage collection becomes critical\n* **Dependency hell** – AI libraries have complex requirements that conflict frequently\n* **Performance bottlenecks** – Python's GIL becomes apparent under heavy concurrent loads\n* **Deployment complexity** – managing GPU dependencies and model weights in containers\n\n**Architecture decisions that paid off:**\n\n1. **Async everywhere** – using asyncio for all I/O operations, including AI model calls\n2. **Worker pools** – separate processes for different AI tasks to isolate failures\n3. **Caching layer** – Redis for expensive AI results, dramatically improved response times\n4. **Health checks** – monitoring AI model availability and fallback mechanisms\n\n**Code patterns that emerged:**\n\n`# Context manager for AI model lifecycle`\n\n`@asynccontextmanager`\n\n`async def ai_model_context(model_name: str):`\n\n`model = await load_model(model_name)`\n\n`try:`\n\n`yield model`\n\n`finally:`\n\n`await cleanup_model(model)`\n\n\n\n`# Retry logic for AI API calls`\n\n`@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential())`\n\n`async def call_ai_api(prompt: str) -&gt; str:`\n\n`# Implementation with proper error handling`\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n1. How are you handling AI model deployment and versioning in production?\n2. What's your experience with alternatives to Celery for AI workloads?\n3. Any success stories with Python performance optimization for AI systems?\n4. How do you manage the costs of AI API calls in high-throughput applications?\n\n**Emerging trends I'm watching:**\n\n* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** – standardizing how AI systems interact with external tools\n* **Local model deployment** – running models like Llama locally for cost/privacy\n* **AI observability tools** – monitoring and debugging AI system behavior\n* **Edge AI with Python** – running lightweight models on edge devices\n\nThe Python AI ecosystem is evolving rapidly.

    "title": "I've created an cross platform app called `PyEnvManager` to make managing python virtual envs easy",
    "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI just released a small tool called **PyEnvManager**. Would love to showcase it and  get feedback from the community .\n\n# Problem\n\nThis all started while I was working on another project that needed a bunch of different Python environments. Different dependencies, different Python versions, little experiments I didn’t want to contaminate — so I kept making new envs. \n\nAt the time it felt like I was being organized. I assumed I had maybe 5–6 environments active. When I finally checked, I had 6 actively used Python virtual environments, but there were also many leftover envs scattered across Conda, venv, Poetry, and Mamba — together they were chewing up \\~45GB on my Windows machine. On my Mac, where I thought things were “clean,” I found another 4 using \\~5GB. And honestly, it was just annoying. I couldn’t remember which ones were safe to delete, which belonged to what project, or why some even existed. Half the time with Jupyter I’d open a notebook, it would throw a *ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas*', and then I’d realize I launched it in the wrong kernel. It wasn’t catastrophic, but it was really annoying — a steady drip of wasted time that broke my flow.\n\nSo, i built this to improve my workflow.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/Pyenvmanager](https://github.com/Pyenvmanager) \n\nWebsite: [https://pyenvmanager.com/](https://pyenvmanager.com/)\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nPyEnvManager is a small desktop app that helps you **discover, manage, and secure Python virtual environments** across a machine . It’s focused on removing the everyday friction of working with many envs and making environment-related security and compliance easy to see.\n\nCore capabilities (today / near-term):\n\n* System-wide environment discovery across different environments (Conda, venv, Poetry, Mamba, Micromamba).\n* Per-env metadata: Python version, disk usage, last-used timestamp.\n* One-click Jupyter launch into the correct environment\n* Create envs from templates or with custom packages.\n* Safe delete with a preview of reclaimed disk space.\n* Dependency surface: searchable package chips and CVE highlighting (dependency scanning aligned with pip-audit behavior).\n* Exportable metadata / SBOM (planned/improving for Teams/Enterprise). \n\nShort form: it finds the envs you forgot about, helps you use the right one, and gives you the tools to clean and audit them.\n\n# Target Audience\n\n**Who it’s for, and how it should be used**\n\n* **Individual developers &amp; data scientists (primary, production-ready):**\n   * Daily local use on laptops and workstations.\n   * If you want to stop wasting time managing kernels, reclaim disk space, and avoid “wrong-kernel” bugs, this is for you.\n* **Small teams / consultancies (early pilots / beta):**\n   * Useful for reproducibility, shared templates, and exporting SBOMs for client work.\n   * Good candidate for a pilot with a few machines to validate workflows and reporting needs. \n   * The product is **production-ready for individual devs** (discovery, Jupyter launch, deletes, templates).\n* Team &amp; enterprise functionality is being added progressively (SBOM exports, snapshots, headless CLI).\n\n# Comparison\n\n* **vs** `pyenv` **/** `conda` **/** `poetry` **(CLI tools):**\n   * Those are excellent for version switching and per-project env creation. They do **not** provide system-wide discovery, a unified GUI, disk-usage visibility, or one-click Jupyter kernel mapping. PyEnvManager sits on top of those workflows and gives a single place to see and act on all envs.\n* **vs** `pip-audit` **/ SCA tools (Snyk, OSV, etc.):**\n   * SCA tools focus on dependency scanning of projects and CI pipelines. PyEnvManager focuses on **installed environments on machines** (local dev workstations), surfacing envs that SCA tools typically never see. It aligns with pip-audit for CVE detection but is not meant to replace enterprise SCA in CI/CD — it complements them by finding the hidden surface area on endpoints.\n* **vs developer GUIs (IDE plugins, Docker Desktop):**\n   * Docker Desktop is a platform for containers and developer workflows. PyEnvManager is specifically about **Python virtual environments**, Jupyter workflows, and reproducibility. The “Docker Desktop for Python envs” analogy helps convey the UX-level ambition: make env discovery and management approachable and visual.",

    "content": "Working on a data extraction project just taught me that not all JSON is created equal. What looked like a “straightforward parsing task” quickly revealed itself as a lesson in defensive programming, graph algorithms, and humility.\n\n**The challenge:** Processing ChatGPT conversation exports that looked like simple JSON arrays… but in reality were directed acyclic graphs with all the charm of a family tree drawn by Kafka.\n\n**Key lessons learned about Python:**\n\n**1. Defensive programming is essential**\n\nBecause JSON in the wild is like Schrödinger’s box - you don’t know if it’s a string, dict, or None until you peek inside.\n\n&gt;\\`\\`\\`python\n\n&gt;*# Always check before 'in' operator*\n\n&gt;if metadata and 'key' in metadata:\n\n&gt;value = metadata\\['key'\\]\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt;*# Handle polymorphic arrays gracefully*  \n\n&gt;for part in parts or \\[\\]:\n\n&gt;if part is None:\n\n&gt;continue\n\n&gt;\\`\\`\\`\n\n**2. Graph traversal beats linear iteration** \n\nWhen JSON contains parent/child relationships, backward traversal from leaf nodes works often much better than trying to sort or reconstruct order.\n\n**3. Content type patterns** \n\nReal-world JSON often mixes strings, objects, and structured data in the same array. Building type-specific handlers saved me hours of debugging (and possibly a minor breakdown).\n\n**4. Memory efficiency matters** \n\nProcessing 500MB+ JSON files called for thinking about memory usage patterns and and garbage collection like a hawk. Nothing sharpens your appreciation of Python’s object model like watching your laptop heat up enough to double as a panini press.\n\n**Technical outcome:**\n\n* 99.5+% success rate processing 7,000 \"conversations.\n* Comprehensive error logging for the 1% of edge cases where reality outsmarted my code\n* Renewed respect for how much defensive programming and domain knowledge matter, even with “simple” data formats\n\n\n\n*Full extractor here*: [chatgpt-conversation-extractor/README.md at master · slyubarskiy/chatgpt-conversation-extractor · GitHub](https://github.com/slyubarskiy/chatgpt-conversation-extractor/blob/master/README.md)",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI built an async security library for FastAPI called AuthTuna to solve some problems I was facing with existing tools.\n\n\n\n# What My Project Does\n\n\n\nAuthTuna is an async-first security library for FastAPI. It's not just a set of helpers; it's a complete foundation for authentication, authorization, and session management. Out of the box, it gives you:\n\n* **Fully async** operations built on SQLAlchemy 2.0.\n* **Hierarchical RBAC** for complex, nested permissions (e.g., `Organization -&gt; Project -&gt; Resource`), which goes beyond simple roles.\n* **Secure, server-side sessions** with built-in hijack detection.\n* A familiar developer experience using standard FastAPI `Depends` and Pydantic models.\n\n\n\n# Target Audience\n\n\n\nThis is built for Python developers using FastAPI to create **production-grade applications**. It's specifically useful for projects that need more complex, granular authorization logic, like multi-tenant SaaS platforms, internal dashboards, or any app where users have different levels of access to specific resources. It is not a toy project and is running in our own production environment.\n\n\n\n# Comparison\n\n\n\nI built this because I needed a specific combination of features that I couldn't find together in other libraries.\n\n* **vs. FastAPI's built-in tools:** The built-in security utilities are great low-level primitives. AuthTuna is a higher-level, \"batteries-included\" framework. You get pre-built user flows, session management, and a full permission system instead of having to build them yourself on top of the primitives.\n* **vs. FastAPI-Users:** FastAPI-Users is an excellent, popular library. AuthTuna differs mainly in its focus on **hierarchical permissions** and its **session model**. If you need to model complex, multi-level access rules (not just \"admin\" or \"user\") and prefer the security model of stateful, server-side sessions over stateless JWTs, then AuthTuna is a better fit.\n\nThe code is up on GitHub, and feedback is welcome.\n\n**GitHub:** [`https://github.com/shashstormer/authtuna`](https://github.com/shashstormer/authtuna)",

It started as an SAT tool, but I've expanded it for everything, and I have custom flashcard deck suggestions for you guys to learn programming syntax and complex CS topics.\n\nHi everyone,\n\nSo, I'm not great at studying, or any good lol. Like when the SATs were coming up in high school, all my friends were getting 1500s, and I was just not, like I couldn't keep up, and I hated that I couldn't just sit down and study like them. The only thing I did all day was browse the web and working on coding projects that i would never finish in the first place.\n\nSo, one day, whilst working on a project and contemplating how bad of a person I was for not studying, I decided why not use my only skill, coding, to force me to study.\n\nAt first I wanted to make like a locker that would prevent my from accessing apps until I answered a question, but I only ever open a few apps a day, but what I did do was load hundreds of websites a da, and that's how the idea flashysurf was born. I didn't even have a real computer at the time, my laptop broke, so I built the first version as a userscript on my old iPad with a cheap Bluetooth mouse. It basically works like this, it's a Chrome extension that just randomly pops up with a flashcard every now and then while you're on YouTube, watching Anime, GitHub, or wherever. You answer it, and you slowly build knowledge without even trying.\n\nIt's completely free and open source ([GitHub link here](https://github.com/MaxDevv/FlashySurf)), and I got a little obsessed with the algorithm  (I've been working on this for like 5-6 months now lol). It's not just random. It uses a combination of psycological techniques to make learning as efficient as possible:\n\n* Dumb Weakness Targeting: Really simple, everytime you get a question wrong, its stored in a list and then later on these quesitons are priorotized that way you work on your weaknesses.\n* Intelligent Weakness Targeting: This was one of the biggest updates I made. For my SAT version, I implemented a semantic clustering system that groups questions by topic. So for example, if you get a question about arithmentic wrong, it knows to show you more questions that are semantically similar. Meaning it actively tarkedts your weak areas. The question selection is split 50% new questions, 35% questions similar to ones you've failed, and 15% direct review of failed questions.\n* Forced Note-Taking: This is in my opinion the most important feature in flashysurf for learning. Basically, if you get a question wrong, you have to write a short note on why you messed up and what you should've done instead, before you can close the card. It forces you to actually assess your mistakes and learn from them, instead of just clicking past them.\n\nAt first, it was just for the SAT, and the results were actually really impressive. I personally got my score up 100 points, which is like going from the top 8% to the top 3% (considered a really big improvement), and a lot of my friends and other online users saw 60-100 point increases. So it proved the concept worked, especially for lazy people like me who want to learn without the effort of a formal study session.\n\nAfter seeing it work so well, I pushed an update, FlashySurf v2.0, so that anyone can study LITERALLY ANYTHING without having to try. You can create and import your own flashcard decks for any subject.\n\nThe only/biggest caveat about flashysurf is that you need to use it for a bit of time to see results like I used it for 2 months to see that 100 point increase (technically that was an outdated version with far less optimizations, so it should take less time) so you can't just use it for a test you have tmrw (unless you set it to be like 100% which would mean that a flashcard would appear on every single website).\n\nIt has a few more features that I couldn't mention here: AI flashcard generation from documents; 30 minute breaks to focus; stats on flashcard collections; and for the SAT, performance reports. (Also if ur wondering why i'm using semicolons, I actually learnt that from studying the SAT using flashysurf lol)\n\nAnd for you guys in r/python, I thought this would be perfect for drilling concepts that just need repetition. So, if you go to the flashysurf [flashcard creator](https://flashysurf.com/creator) you can actually use the AI flashcard import/maker tool to convert any documents (i.e. programming problems/exercises you have) or your own flashcard decks into flashysurf flashcards. So you can work on complex programming topics like Big O notation, dynamic programming, and graph theory algorithms. Note: You will obviously need the extension to use the cards lol but when you install the extension, you'll recieve [instructions](https://flashysurf.com/onboarding) on creating and importing flashcards, so you don't gotta memorize any of this.\n\nYou can download it from the Chrome Web Store, link in the website: [https://flashysurf.com/](https://flashysurf.com/?utm_source=rpst&amp;utm_campaign=rpython)\n\nI'm still actively working on it (just pushed a bugfix yesterday lol), so I'd love to hear any feedback or ideas you have. Hope it helps you learn something new while you're procrastinating on your actual work.\n\nThanks for reading :D\n\nComplicance thingy\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nFlashySurf is a free, open-source Chrome extension that helps users learn and study by showing them flashcards as they browse the web. It uses a spaced repetition algorithm with semantic analysis to identify and target a user's weaknesses. The extension also has features like a \"Forced Note-Taking\" system to ensure users learn from their mistakes, and it allows for custom flashcard decks so it can be used for any subject.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nFlashySurf is intended for anyone who wants to learn or study new information without the effort of a formal study session. It is particularly useful for students, professionals, or hobbyists who spend a lot of time on the web and want to use that time more productively. It's a production-ready project that's been in development for over six months, with a focus on being a long-term learning tool.\n\n# Comparison\n\nWhile there are other flashcard and spaced repetition tools, FlashySurf stands out by integrating learning directly into a user's everyday browsing habits. Unlike traditional apps like Anki, which require dedicated study sessions, FlashySurf brings the flashcards to you. Its unique combination of a spaced repetition algorithm with a semantic clustering system means it not only reinforces what you've learned but actively focuses on related topics where you are weakest. This approach is designed to help \"lazy\" learners like me who struggle with traditional study methods.",

    "content": "# What My Project Does:\n\n`pytest-fixtures-fixtures` is a pytest plugin that provides fixtures to easily read and work with test data files (JSON, CSV, YAML, JSONL, plain text, custom) in your tests. Instead of writing boilerplate code to read files in every test, you get clean fixtures that handle file reading, parsing, and error handling automatically.\n\nThe plugin also includes a decorator to parametrise tests directly from data files, making data-driven testing much more straightforward.\n\n# Target Audience:\n\nThis is designed for Python developers who use pytest for testing and regularly work with test data files. It's production-ready and suitable for:\n\n* Teams writing comprehensive test suites\n* Developers doing data-driven testing\n* Anyone tired of writing file-reading boilerplate in tests\n* Projects that need clean separation between test logic and test data\n\n# Comparison:\n\nWhile there are other pytest plugins that help with test data (`pytest-datafiles`, `pytest-datadir`), `pytest-fixtures-fixtures` differs in several key ways:\n\n* **Fixture-based approach**: Uses pytest's native fixture system rather than custom decorators or utilities\n* **Multiple format support**: Handles JSON, CSV, YAML, JSONL, plain text with a consistent API plus it lets you provide your own deserialisation\n* **Built-in parametrisation**: The `@parametrize_from_fixture` decorator lets you create data-driven tests directly from files\n* **Type safety**: Full type hints and protocols for better IDE support\n* **Error handling**: Clear error messages when files are missing or malformed\n* **Flexible configuration**: Easy to customise the fixtures directory and behaviour\n\n# Example Usage:\n\n    # Before: lots of boilerplate\n    def test_user_data():\n        with open(\"tests/fixtures/users.json\") as f:\n            data = json.load(f)\n        assert data[\"name\"] == \"Alice\"\n    \n    # After: clean and simple\n    def test_user_data(read_json_fixture):\n        data = read_json_fixture(\"users.json\")\n        assert data[\"name\"] == \"Alice\"\n    \n    # Even better: parametrize from data files\n    @parametrize_from_fixture(\"test_cases.csv\")\n    def test_math_operations(a, b, expected):\n        assert int(a) + int(b) == int(expected)\n\n# Key Features:\n\n* Supports JSON, CSV, YAML, JSONL, and plain text files + custom deserialisation\n* Automatic file parsing with proper error handling\n* Parametrise tests directly from data files with custom test IDs\n* Configurable fixtures directory (defaults to `tests/fixtures/`)\n* Type hints and clear error messages\n* Works with pytest's existing fixture system\n\n# Installation:\n\n    pip install pytest-fixtures-fixtures\n\n# Links:\n\n**GitHub:** [https://github.com/fferegrino/pytest-fixtures-fixtures](https://github.com/fferegrino/pytest-fixtures-fixtures)  \n**PyPI:** [https://pypi.org/project/pytest-fixtures-fixtures/](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-fixtures-fixtures/)  \n**Docs:** [https://fferegrino.github.io/pytest-fixtures-fixtures/](https://fferegrino.github.io/pytest-fixtures-fixtures/)\n\n**Why I built it:** I was tired of writing the same file-reading boilerplate in every test suite. This keeps test data separate from test logic and makes data-driven testing much easier.\n\n# What do you think?\n\n* Does this solve a problem you've faced?\n* Any features you'd like to see?\n* How do you currently handle test data files in your projects?\n\nI'd love feedback from the community to make this tool better.",

    "content": "Project Site: [https://github.com/cybergeek1943/MathFlow](https://github.com/cybergeek1943/MathFlow)\n\nIn the process of doing research for my paper [Combinatorial and Gaussian Foundations of Rational Nth Root Approximations](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.14095) (on arXiv), I created this library to address the pain points I felt when using only SymPy and SciPy separately. I wanted something lightweight, easy to use (exploratory), and something that would support numerical methods more easily. Hence, I created this lightweight wrapper that provides a hybrid symbolic-numerical interface to symbolic and numerical backends. It is backward compatible with Sympy. In short, this enables much faster analysis of symbolic math expressions by providing both numerical and traditional symbolic methods of analysis in the same interface. I have also added additional numerical methods that neither SymPy nor SciPy have (Pade approximations, numerical roots, etc.). The main goal for this project is to provide a tool that requires as little of a learning curve as possible and allows them to just focus on the math they are doing.\n\n# Core features\n\n* **🔒 Operative Closure**: Mathematical operations return new Expression objects by default\n* **⚡ Mutability Control**: Choose between immutable (default) and mutable expressions for different workflows\n* **🔗 Seamless Numerical Integration**: Every symbolic expression has a `.n` attribute providing numerical methods without manual lambdification (uses cached lambdified expression when needed)\n* **🎨 Enhanced Printing**: Flexible output formatting through the `.print` attribute (LaTeX, pretty printing, code generation)\n* **📡 Signal System**: Qt-like signals for tracking expression mutations and clones, enabling reactive programming\n* **🔄 Automatic Type Conversions**: Seamlessly and automatically converts between internal Poly and Expr representations based on context\n* **📦 Lightweight**: \\~0.5 MB itself, \\~100 MB including dependencies\n* **🧩 Fully backward compatible**: Seamlessly integrate SymPy and MathFlow in the same script. All methods that work on SymPy Expr or Poly objects work on MathFlow objects\n* **🔍 Exploratory**: Full IDE support, enabling easy tool finding and minimizing the learning curve.\n\nA few examples are shown below. Many more examples can be found in the README of the official GitHub site.\n\n# Quick Start\n\nInstall using: `pip install mathflow`\n\n    from mathflow import Expression, Polynomial, Rational\n    \n    # Create expressions naturally\n    f = Expression(\"2x^2 + 3x + \\frac{1}{2}\")  # latex is automatically parsed\n    g = Expression(\"sin(x) + cos(x)\")\n    \n    # Automatic operative closure - operations return new objects of the same type\n    h = f + g  # f and g remain unchanged\n    hprime = h.diff()  # hprime is still an Expression object\n    \n    # Numerical evaluation made easy\n    result = f(2.5)  # Numerically evaluate at x = 2.5\n    \n    # Use the .n attribute to access fast numerical methods\n    numerical_roots = f.n.all_roots()\n    # Call f's n-prefixed methods to use variable precision numerical methods\n    precise_roots = f.nsolve_all(prec=50)  # 50 digits of accuracy\n    \n    # quick and easy printing\n    f.print()\n    f.print('latex')  # LaTeX output\n    f.print('mathematica_code')\n    f.print('ccode')  # c code output\n\n# Numerical Computing\n\nMathFlow excels at bridging symbolic and numerical mathematics:\n\n    f = Expression(\"x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 1\")\n    \n    # Root finding\n    all_roots = f.n.all_roots(bounds=(-5, 5))\n    specific_root = f.nsolve_all(bounds=(-5, 5), prec=50)  # High-precision solve\n    \n    # Numerical calculus\n    derivative_func = f.n.derivative_lambda(df_order=2)  # 2nd derivative numerical function  \n    integral_result = f.n.integrate(-1, 1)               # Definite integral  \n    \n    # Optimization\n    minimum = f.n.minimize(bounds=[(-2, 2)])\n\n# Edit:\n\nThis project was developed and used primarily for a research project, so a thorough test suite has not yet been developed. The project is still in development, and the current release is an alpha version. I have tried to minimize danger here, however, by designing it as a proxy to the already well-tested SymPy and SciPy libraries.",

The program allows single MIDI files or playlists of MIDI files to be loaded and visualised through a command-line tool.\n\nIt's fairly simple, using Pygame to display the visualiser window and provide playback control, but I'm pretty proud of how it looks and the audio-syncing logic (which uses Mido to interpret MIDI events). More details on how to use it are available in the [project repository](https://github.com/benjaminrall/midi-visualiser).\n\nThis is the first project I've used [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for, and I absolutely love it - check it out if you haven't already. Also, any suggestions/comments about the project would be greatly appreciated as I'm very new to uploading to PyPI!\n\nTo summarise;\n- **What My Project Does**: Plays MIDI files and visualises them using a scrolling piano roll\n- **Target Audience**: Mainly just a toy project, but could be used by anyone who wants a simple &amp; quick way to view any MIDI file!\n- **Comparison**: I can't find any alternatives that have this same functionality (at least not made in Python) - it obviously can't compete with mega fancy MIDI visualisers, but a strong point is how straight forward the project is, working immediately from the command-line without needing any configuration.\n\nEdit: Thanks to a comment, I've discovered an issue that means this only works on Windows - will look into fixing this, sorry!",

    "content": "Hey guys, I just released **SplitterMR**, a library I built because none of the existing tools quite did what I wanted for slicing up documents cleanly for LLMs / downstream processing.\n\nIf you often work with **mixed document types** (PDFs, Word, Excel, Markdown, images, etc.) and **need flexible, reliable splitting/parsing**, this might be useful.\n\nThis library supports **multiple input formats**, e.g., text, Markdown, PDF, Word / Excel / PowerPoint, HTML / XML, JSON / YAML, CSV / TSV, and even images.\n\nFiles can be read using **MarkItDown** or **Docling**, so this is perfect if you are using those frameworks with your current applications.\n\nLogically, it supports **many different splitting strategies**: not only based on the number of characters but on tokens, schema keys, semantic similarity, and many other techniques. You can even develop your own splitter using the Base object, and it is the same for the Readers!\n\nIn addition, **you can process the graphical resources of your documents (e.g., photos) using VLMs** (OpenAI, Gemini, HuggingFace, etc.), so you can extract the text or caption them!\n\n# What’s new / what’s good in the latest release\n\n* Stable Version **1.0.0** is out.\n* Supports **more input formats / more robust readers**.\n* **Stable API** for the Reader abstractions so you can plug in your own if needed.\n* **Better handling of edge cases** (e.g. images, schema’d JSON / XML) so you don’t lose structure unintentionally.\n\n# Some trade-offs / limitations (so you don’t run into surprises)\n\n* **Heavy dependencies**: because it supports all these formats you’ll pull in a bunch of libs (PDF, Word, image parsing, etc.). If you only care about plain text, many of those won’t matter, but still.\n* **Not a fully “LLM prompt manager” or embedding chunker out of the box** — splitting + parsing is its job; downstream you’ll still need to decide chunk sizes, context windows, etc.\n\n# Installation and usage\n\nIf you want to test:\n\n    uv add splitter-mr\n\nExample usage:\n\n    from splitter_mr.reader import VanillaReader\n    from splitter_mr.model.models import AzureOpenAIVisionModel\n    \n    model = AzureOpenAIVisionModel()\n    reader = VanillaReader(model=model)\n    output = reader.read(file_path=\"data/sample_pdf.pdf\")\n    print(output.text)\n\n**Check out the docs for more examples, API details, and instructions on how to write your own Reader for special formats:**  \n\n* 👉 [Github](https://github.com/andreshere00/Splitter_MR)\n* 👉 [Documentation server](https://andreshere00.github.io/Splitter_MR/)\n* 👉 [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/splitter-mr/1.0.1/)\n* 👉 [LinkedIn (to contact with me)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-herencia)\n\nIf you want to collaborate or you have some suggestions, don't dubt to contact me.\n\n**Thank you so much for reading :)**\n",

He took the idea to senior management and presented the cost saving and benefits. Once it was deployed he was offered shares in the company and then a cash bonus once a year of realised savings was achieved. \n\nI’ve been advised by my HR friend to approach senior management with my proposal, explain that I’ve already spoken to my manager and detail the cost savings I can make, ask for a salary increase to provide ongoing support and develop my code further and ask for similar terms to that of the person who did this previously. He has confirmed what I’ve done doesn’t go against any HR policies or my contract. \n\nMeeting is booked for next week and I’ve had 2 messages from senior management saying how excited they are to see my idea :) \n\n",

    "content": "Hey r/Python,\n\nI built Flowfile, an open-source tool for creating data pipelines both visually and in code. Here's the latest feature: Custom Node Designer.\n\n# What My Project Does\n\nFlowfile creates bidirectional conversion between visual ETL workflows and Python code. You can build pipelines visually and export to Python, or write Python and visualize it. The Custom Node Designer lets you define new visual nodes using Python classes with Pydantic for settings and Polars for data processing.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nProduction-ready tool for data engineers who work with ETL pipelines. Also useful for prototyping and teams that need both visual and code representations of their workflows.\n\n# Comparison\n\n* **Alteryx**: Proprietary, expensive. Flowfile is open-source.\n* **Apache NiFi**: Java-based, requires infrastructure. Flowfile is pip-installable Python.\n* **Prefect/Dagster**: Orchestration-focused. Flowfile focuses on visual pipeline building.\n\n# Custom Node Example\n\n    import polars as pl\n    from flowfile_core.flowfile.node_designer import (\n        CustomNodeBase, NodeSettings, Section,\n        ColumnSelector, MultiSelect, Types\n    )\n    \n    class TextCleanerSettings(NodeSettings):\n        cleaning_options: Section = Section(\n            title=\"Cleaning Options\",\n            text_column=ColumnSelector(label=\"Column to Clean\", data_types=Types.String),\n            operations=MultiSelect(\n                label=\"Cleaning Operations\",\n                options=[\"lowercase\", \"remove_punctuation\", \"trim\"],\n                default=[\"lowercase\", \"trim\"]\n            )\n        )\n    \n    class TextCleanerNode(CustomNodeBase):\n        node_name: str = \"Text Cleaner\"\n        settings_schema: TextCleanerSettings = TextCleanerSettings()\n    \n        def process(self, input_df: pl.LazyFrame) -&gt; pl.LazyFrame:\n            text_col = self.settings_schema.cleaning_options.text_column.value\n            operations = self.settings_schema.cleaning_options.operations.value\n            \n            expr = pl.col(text_col)\n            if \"lowercase\" in operations:\n                expr = expr.str.to_lowercase()\n            if \"trim\" in operations:\n                expr = expr.str.strip_chars()\n            \n            return input_df.with_columns(expr.alias(f\"{text_col}_cleaned\"))\n\nSave in `~/.flowfile/user_defined_nodes/` and it appears in the visual editor.\n\n# Why This Matters\n\nYou can wrap complex tasks—API connections, custom validations, niche library functions—into simple drag-and-drop blocks. Build your own high-level tool palette right inside the app. It's all built on Polars for speed and completely open-source.\n\n# Installation\n\n`pip install Flowfile`\n\n# Links\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/Edwardvaneechoud/Flowfile/](https://github.com/Edwardvaneechoud/Flowfile/)\n* Custom Nodes Documentation: [https://edwardvaneechoud.github.io/Flowfile/for-developers/creating-custom-nodes.html](https://edwardvaneechoud.github.io/Flowfile/for-developers/creating-custom-nodes.html)\n* Previous discussions: [SideProject post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mp0hor/i_built_a_tool_that_turns_python_data_pipelines/), [FlowFrame post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1kp0er9/flowframe_python_code_that_generates_visual_etl/)",

    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nOver the past few months I’ve been building a Python package called `numethods` — a small but growing collection of **classic numerical algorithms implemented 100% from scratch**. No NumPy, no SciPy, just plain Python floats and list-of-lists.\n\nThe idea is to make algorithms transparent and educational, so you can actually *see* how LU decomposition, power iteration, or RK4 are implemented under the hood. This is especially useful for students, self-learners, or anyone who wants a deeper feel for how numerical methods work beyond calling library functions.\n\n[https://github.com/denizd1/numethods](https://github.com/denizd1/numethods)\n\n# 🔧 What’s included so far\n\n* **Linear system solvers**: LU (with pivoting), Gauss–Jordan, Jacobi, Gauss–Seidel, Cholesky\n* **Root-finding**: Bisection, Fixed-Point Iteration, Secant, Newton’s method\n* **Interpolation**: Newton divided differences, Lagrange form\n* **Quadrature (integration)**: Trapezoidal rule, Simpson’s rule, Gauss–Legendre (2- and 3-point)\n* **Orthogonalization &amp; least squares**: Gram–Schmidt, Householder QR, LS solver\n* **Eigenvalue methods**: Power iteration, Inverse iteration, Rayleigh quotient iteration, QR iteration\n* **SVD** (via eigen-decomposition of ATAA\\^T AATA)\n* **ODE solvers**: Euler, Heun, RK2, RK4, Backward Euler, Trapezoidal, Adams–Bashforth, Adams–Moulton, Predictor–Corrector, Adaptive RK45\n\n# ✅ Why this might be useful\n\n* Great for **teaching/learning** numerical methods step by step.\n* Good reference for people writing their own solvers in C/Fortran/Julia.\n* Lightweight, no dependencies.\n* Consistent object-oriented API (`.solve()`, `.integrate()` etc).\n\n# 🚀 What’s next\n\n* PDE solvers (heat, wave, Poisson with finite differences)\n* More optimization methods (conjugate gradient, quasi-Newton)\n* Spectral methods and advanced quadrature\n\n👉 If you’re learning numerical analysis, want to peek under the hood, or just like playing with algorithms, I’d love for you to check it out and give feedback.",
