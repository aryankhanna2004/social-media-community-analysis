My main interests were CITY and Violet Evergarden so apologies for no photos of Dragon Maid, Hibike, etc. The exhibition included a ton of original animation art, replica scene flipbooks, displays about their creative process, hand-drawn thank you sketches from the staff, and more. They also held several live events like a concert and panel talks with staff and voice actors.\n\nOverall, it was really awesome and I'd recommend it even if you don't understand Japanese. My biggest regret is that I walked through the exhibition first before trying to buy merchandise and all of the good items were already sold out 1.5 hours after opening. On the bright side, admission included a booklet of the staff sketches so everyone got a free souvenir.",

It felt high stakes and it really got my blood pumping while watching it. \n\nI can’t remember exactly what happened but I heard that the writer was suffering from health conditions… I really wish these mangaka’s would take a break sometimes and watch out for themselves. This sort of thing just seems so common, I’ve watched so many anime, then when I finish it, I look up to see if it’s canceled or what. Very often I see, “no, X anime is not canceled, but X writer is suffering from health issues.” It really is a shame, I hope his health improves. Thoughts and prayers go out to the people in Japan. ",

    "content": "Help me find anime I watched as a kid. Now this has been 15-20 years ago so I don’t remember much of the plot but I do remember specific scenes. I tried finding it online but I feel like this is some very obscure show. I think it was a movie but I might be wrong. It was more drawn in 80-90ss style. It was more grounded and realistic looking \n\nSpecific things I remember \nThe main girl’s powers awakened in the middle of the night. As she was going to the bathroom she touched and bent electronics in the house (I think it was a vcr). Girls powers were physical strength. Do not remember her having psychic abilities. Later in the movie they that she went through some kind of transformation, got more mature body that was mascular. She also had shorter brown/dark hair\nThere was also this particular scene where at some point of the story she and her friends where hiding in the elevator shaft. The girl was holding couple of her friends on her back while spread out touching walls with her hand and feet and I think she was semi nude although it was not explicit. I remember shirt was getting tight/ripping on her. \nShe also had a black friend who had kind of shorter dreadlocks. His power was absorbing material properties and becoming that material if he was touching it. At some point he ended up in water and was shooting water out of his hands during the main fight \n\nThere was also one of the bed guys who was training in a dojo while talking on the phone/video call with another antagonist who was female. And he snapped a leg of the guy he trained with with I think telekinesis but I might be wrong there \n\nSorry if this is all a mess. Literally trying to remember some random show i saw many years ago. Any help and suggestions would be highly appreciated ",

She experienced the loss of a friend, and she was expressing herself by hurting a *ton* of people.\n\nI remembered her eyes the first time, but they never stood out to me at that time as being more than grief-stricken or wild like a wounded animal.\n\nBetween my last watching of MHA to now, I had the privilege of watching Jujutsu Kaisen. Granted, I enjoyed the watch, and I'm going to watch it again when the last season finally comes out, but it wasn't a ground-breaking show for me, as it might not have been for others.\n\nOne thing that *did* leave its mark on me, other than the \"**BROTHER\"** scene with Aoi Todo was when Mahito killed Junpei. It was such a well-written scene, and it tugged hard at my heart strings. But Yuji then hit us with a quote that has been engraved on me for life:\n\n&gt;\n\nI quickly paused the scene during Toga's rampage, and the look in her eyes was unmistakable.\n\nPain. Honesty. Sincerity. \"I might die in the process, but I will do everything within me to punish you.\"\n\n(You also see this look from Thorfin in Vinland Saga, but I didn't want to crowd the image or the essay.)\n\nThanks for those who read this, and I can't wait for the finale of MHA and JJK! &lt;3",

    "content": "Many years ago I was looking for an old cartoon and asked in [tipofmytongue](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/5gocbm/tomt_video_cartoon_looking_for_an_old_cartoon_set/) (the original request is in the link). None of the answers there suited the bill, so now it struck me that maybe it wasn't a western cartoon but an anime. So here's what I remember from that cartoon/anime:\n\nThere's some medieval fantasy world and there's a villain looking like a black knight who seeks for a way to corrupt some powerful magic gem. The villain's minions are goblin-like (or smurf-like) creatures representing 7 sins like lazyness, greed and such (maybe there's more of them, i dont really remember). These goblin-like creatures are basically everything i remember about this cartoon. Many episodes revolve around a certain goblin and how to fight his sin. So if it's a laziness sin, our heroes have to fight off their own laziness, and if they do, the sin creature is defeated.\n\nAnother thing I remember now is that those sin goblins weren't irredeemably evil, they were kind of comic relief, too.\n\nOh, and another thing: in one of the episodes, the black knight does succeed at corrupting the gem so the gem turns black, too.\n\nI think it's 80s or early 90s cartoon/anime but I'm not sure about it. I watched it in the 90s so it's definitely not from 2000-2025.",

    "content": "There are a quite lot of anime that require a knowledge of Japanese history, culture and/or philosophy to understand it. But what some anime that require a very specific and unusual knowledge? Let me bring up some example\n\nBetterman(1999) this mecha anime series requires you to have an in-depth understanding of biology to understand even a single thing about it. If you don't know what's apoptosis, mycorrhizae, synapse, Lamarckian evolution, punctuated equilibrium, autopoiesis etc. you will not understand this show at all.\n\nBook of Dead(2005) this is a pretty cool and obscure arthouse stop-motion movie that was lauded by the critics. It requires you to have an in-depth knowledge of Tibetan Buddhism and specifically of the eponymous \"Tibetan Book of Dead\" which in detail describes the transient states that living energy(what westerns might incorrectly call \"soul\") undergoes in afterlife. It's utterly incomprehensible without it.\n\nGilgamesh(2003) series requires you to have read an actual Ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh to understand it's finale.\n\nGasaraki(1998) series doesn't require it, but is greatly enhanced if you know the history of the real life Operation Desert Storm, when coalition led by USA attacked Iraq that invaded Kuwait. It's basically an anime recreation of Operation Desert Storm with mechas and mysticism. \n\n\nWhat are some other examples that you know of?\n\n",

A main issue was the fact that they were having difficulty working together as a team, that's why they had to train in the specialized room. I recall there being around 4-5 characters with various specialties (EX: recon, close combat, sniping, strategy. I'm not certain these were the exact specialties) Does anyone know any that would meet this criteria?\n\n",

But after watching OPM 3 on youtube, well, it made me want to check out saitama vs genos and saitama vs boros again. It's just disgustingly cool in my opinion. \n\nThe last anime I watched 1x speed was a scene in solo leveling, it was a cool fight, then after that just sped up again. \n\n  \nWas wondering if what other anime has fights like this and hopefully, the story is entertaining or good. It doesn't necessarily have to be fantastical like OPM. \n\nWell, apart from mob psycho, what else would you recommend? \n\n  \n",

Overall it‘s not a modern setting because I remember her sitting in a carriage. \n\nThe episode begins with mc arriving at an older, rich man‘s house. He orders mc to find his missing daughter who is/was a chemistry student. For more clues the mc visits the bar the missing daughter used to frequenty visit. The barkeeper seems to be familiar with the daughter. Over the episode we learn that the daughter invented a drug that is circulating through the region. \n\nWhat I also remember is that the mc visits the daughter‘s apartment, either the mc or other people hired by the father find the corpse of the boyfriend from missing daughter under the bed. \n\nI also remember the mc almost getting shot at at the end but instead the bad guys ended up shot. \n\nIn the end the mc helps the daughter flee the region. \n\nI think it‘s a newer anime since I remember the animation being modern. \n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "My Thoughts on Psycho Pass Season 2",
    "content": "Psycho Pass Season 1 is one of my favorite anime of all time.  Season 2 is an absolute disgrace.  I hated it when I first saw it back in 2014, and in the same way that I kind of thought I might like season 1 less when I re-watched it after all these years, (which thankfully didn't happen), I was hoping that I would like season 2 MORE after more than a decade.  But not only did that not happen, I think I actually like it less than I did back then, which is saying a lot.  It's just terrible.  It ruins everything that was great in season 1, introduces characters that are butchered versions of legacy characters in terms of both personalities and themes, and is just really bad.  Season 2 wasn't written by Gen Urobuchi or produced by Production I.G.  The writer was Jun Kumagai, which was also the guy who wrote Hamatora The Animation--and that should be all I have to say about that if you're at all familiar with that anime--and it was produced by Tatsunoko Productions, which isn't a bad anime studio by any means, but they're nowhere near on the level of Production I.G., especially from that era.  It's also only 11 episodes, whereas the first season was 22 episodes.  Of course that's not inherently a bad thing, there's many great anime that's only 11 episodes long, but Psycho Pass season 1 definitely needed that double length, and season 2 could have also used it in order to flesh out many of the admittingly interesting concepts that go unexplored.  Although don't get me wrong, I don't think that would have magically made this anime good.  \n\n  \nThe characters are awful.  Thankfully I don't think the returning characters are harmed, those being Akane Tsunemori and Nobuchika Ginoza.  At the end of the last season Akane got a promotion, while Ginoza was demoted to an Enforcer serving under Akane when his Psycho Pass got too high.  And their characters aren't advanced in this season, but they aren't ruined either necessarily, which is good at least.  But the new characters are terrible.  Mika Shimotsuki was the worst of them.  She was introduced at the end of season 1 as a new wide eyed inspector much like how Akane started except Akane would be her superior.  This concept intrigued me.  I really wanted to see Akane put in Ginoza's place, with her different, more optimistic personality but still having grown to be less naive.  Seeing this honestly unique character be the one to lead a new inspector sounded very interesting to me.  But Mika is so badly written.  She is annoying and stupid.  It seems like they were trying to do a mix of Akane's and Ginoza's starter personalities with her. I hope I don't have to explain why those two personalities are incompatible in one person, but they also butcher those personalities.  Akane was naive at the start, but she was still smart, and she was quick to learn what the situation was and alter her views and approach appropriately.  And Ginoza was hard on the Enforcers, but that was because of his past and the perceived \"betrayal\" of two inspectors in the past who became Enforcers, his partner and his father.  He was a complex and sympathetic character and he grew and evolved as it continued.  \n\n  \nMika is nothing like that.  Her character basically starts and ends with hating Enforcers and being naive about the world she's in and stuck in her ways.  That could be fine if the series commented on that or punished her for her personality, but that never happens either.  I mean I guess there was that one scene where Mika meets Misato Tougane, the leader of the Sibyl system, and the latter tells the former the truth about the system that Akane learned at the end of the last season, but I just think that scene is funny.  I mean common, how can you look at that scene, the way Mika is smiling and clapping, and not piss yourself laughing.  And she also doesn't change much from it either after that scene, and even seems to agree with the Sibyl system at least by the way she reacted in that scene, which completely goes against the character that was established beforehand, as poor as it was it still made clear what she stood for, and this is the antithesis to that.  Sakuuya Tougane is also a terrible character, he's just cartoonishly evil with no clear motivation given.  The villains in season 1 could sometimes teter on over the top, but there was always some meaningfully deep and sympathetic reason for their horrible actions, that didn't justify them but where you could also see that the Sibyl System maybe didn't create their mental problems but made them a hundred times worse.  \n\n  \nAnd many of the same things can be said about the main villain, Kirito Kamui.  First of all, while this may seem like a nitpick, since Sword Art Online it's hard for me to take any main character in an anime seriously if his name is Kirito...which granted this is only the second I've ever seen.  And I say that as someone who unironically likes Sword Art Online, I'm sorry.  But beyond that, he's basically just Shogo Makishima but without the charm, intelligence, complexity, the intrigue, or the unique and cool character design.  I almost wanted to call Psycho Pass season 2 so bad it's good, because there are genuinely funny scenes that aren't MEANT to be funny.  There's that scene I mentioned previously, where Mika meets Misato Tougane, the leader of the Sibyl system, and the latter tells the former the truth about the system that Akane learned at the end of the last season, and Mika stares at her with vacant eyes smiling and clapping.  But there was also that scene where dozens of people are splattered by dominators because of a mobile game that was super popular where the individuals playing were unknowingly killing people.  And towards the end of the series a building was burning with this extremely out of place opera music playing over the disaster.  But I can't fully say I enjoyed it for those so bad it's good qualities because it's coming off the back of a 10/10 masterpiece.  \n\n  \nIt's unfortunate that this season was so poorly written.  I don't think the production values were butchered compared to season 1, but Psycho Pass was never carried by the production values, the animation and art, those were only additional boons to the series, not the reason to watch it.  The reason to watch it was for the story, characters, and themes, and those were destroyed in this season.  Thankfully I remember the 2015 movie being better, which I have to re-watch next.  ",

    "content": "So this was probably between 2008- 2014.\n\nI was maybe 7 years old and snuck to the living room to watch Netflix after my parents had gone to bed because I wanted to see the pretty cartoons like Cardcaptor Sakura. I played one and lo and behold, a tentacle monster appeared. There was some sort of warrior girl fighting it and even as a child I knew it was sexual.\n\nI had nightmares about it for a long time and really want to see what I had actually watched since the memory is so hazy. I mean it was on Netflix so how bad could it be? I know this is such a long shot but maybe someone out there is super into vintage ecchi?\n\n[ EDIT: I really, really appreciate all the suggestions! If I do come across it eventually, I will try to update this post to satisfy any lingering curiosity.\n\nHere’s a recap of what I’ve remembered:\n\n- rocky terrain\n\n- dark out\n\n- girl had long hair, probably turquoise (maybe pink), and probably in a ponytail\n\n- tentacle (maybe octopus?) monster ]\n\n[ EDIT 2: SOLVED! I’m 85% sure it’s Queen’s Blade, pointed out by u/necoariadne. Thank you so much!!!! I know it’s stupid but this has haunted me for a while. I feel relieved to finally know. It actually does mean a lot to me so I appreciate everyone’s suggestions greatly. ESPECIALLY considering how straight up ass my description was ]",

    "title": "My Thoughts on Psycho Pass Season 1",
    "content": "Psycho Pass is one of my favorite anime of all time.  At least in terms of season 1.  It has been ever since I first saw it back in 2014, and while I haven't seen it since, after finally re-watching it, (mainly because I just learned how many new installments there have been), I'm glad to find that it still holds up perfectly.  It's an amazing anime that I would probably classify as \"mid sci-fi.\"  What I mean by that, because the term \"mid\" obviously has a different, more annoying meaning nowadays, is a middle ground between soft sci-fi and hard sci-fi.  It's also possibly my favorite cyberpunk story ever written.  This anime, along with Fate/Zero, both of which I watched for the first time in 2014, made me fall in love with Gen Urobuchi's writing.  His style has influenced my own writing style so much over the past 11 years.  He's a master of creating instantly likable, interesting, and sympathetic characters, as well as fascinating plots with deep themes that can, in some ways, be allegories for our current world.  \n\n  \nPsycho Pass takes place in the year 2112, 100 years after the series aired.  Japan is the only peaceful country on Earth due in part to the Sibyl system, a type of technology that basically runs the legal system.  The Sibyl System, which is represented by dozens of cameras and camera robots throughout the country, is able to accurately analyze a person's mental state, known as their Psycho Pass, and determine if they are latent criminals.  If their Psycho Pass gets too high they're latent criminals and will be arrested and from that point on their life is basically over.  There's no chance of it ever getting low enough to be set free again.  If it's over 300 then they are actually to be eliminated.  The cops in this bleak future are called Inspectors, and they're joined by \"hunting dogs\" known as Enforcers.  Enforcers are latent criminals who agree to help Inspectors in order to get some tiny semblance of freedom.  Both Enforcers and Inspectors have massive guns called Dominators which have three settings.  Lethal Eliminator for criminals who have a Psycho Pass over 300, Non Lethal Paralyzer for criminals who don't have a Psycho Pass that high but still too high to be a free person, and if a person's Psycho Pass is too low it'll lock and is unable to be used.  \n\n  \nFrom that alone, I think you can tell what the themes are, even if you haven't seen it.  It's all about free will, and whether a person's future can be determined via logical brain analysis.  It takes the stance that the Sibyl System is inherently flawed, as the choice to commit crime, no matter how severe or basic the crime is, comes from the heart not the brain; intellectual thought may be used to help someone commit said crime and get away with it, but it's still their heart, their emotions, that kickstarts it to begin with.  But this flaw goes over the Sibyl System's head.  There's rare people in the world who are Criminally Asymptomatic.  These are people who are immune to the Dominators judging, no matter what they do their Psycho Pass reading will keep going down, including that of the main villain of the series Shogo Makishima.  The Sibyl System likes to secretly harvest the brains of criminally asymptomatic people and incorporate them into the Sibyl System to try and improve it.  And as for another theme, I personally think that Criminally Asymptomatic people are meant to be an allegory for Sociopaths, who are people who are skilled at hiding their own mental illnesses, and while not always, often end up committing crimes because of this.  Famously they're able to get passed lie detector tests, and the Dominators are kind of like lie detectors with extra steps, so it does kind of make sense to me, but I have gotten push back on that topic before.  \n\n  \nIt does get a bit more interesting though because, like I said before, Japan is basically the only country on Earth that is pretty much close to being crime free.  Supposedly every other country is chaotic and war torn, and with Japan being cut off from the rest of the world, returning to Edo era isolation if you will, Japan has been made mostly peaceful.  Of course I say mostly because there's obviously lots of people who slip through the cracks, and innocent people who are imprisoned or killed, but comparatively.  That kind of sets up an insanely more bleak world than you might notice on the surface, where the  best country to live in the world is still absolute hell.  I kind of love it, honestly.  It's too bad season 2 was so shit.  \n\n  \nOkay, so now let's talk about the characters.  I love Akane Tsunemori.  I remember she was kind of controversial back in the day mainly because how she starts which is kind of milquetoast, but I loved her though.  She starts very naive and innocent, but after being exposed to all of the horrible stuff the Sibyl System has caused she does grow into a more wise and intelligent leader within the police force, while never completely losing her ideals which conflicts with the Sibyl System, she just learns to operate with those ideals within the system.  I actually think she's one of the more unique female anime protagonists to be honest.  I also loved Shinya Kogami.  He compliments Akane extremely well as a partner.  They're basically polar opposites at the start, but they learn to understand and respect each other by the end, even as they part ways and walk different paths.  And Shogo Makishima is probably one of the best and most interesting villains in anime history.  He's extremely charismatic so he's able to manipulate people who are arguably just as mentally unstable as him, or even more, so to work for and worship him, he's vastly intelligent, and like I said before he's criminally asymptomatic.  These last two factors allows him to avoid the Sibyl System for many years, to the point that Shinya Kogami has to take matters into his own hands and kill him with a normal gun at the end of the series.  \n\n  \nHe's also interesting in his motives too.  He is a psychopath, but he believes that what makes you \"human\" is the ability to act freely on your base, primal desires, and because of that he wants to bring down the Sibyl System, or at the very least bring the truth of it to the public's attention, which will cause panic, chaos, and riots.  I think a lot of people would still think he's a bad person and disagree with his methods, considering that many of them involve killing purely innocent people for seemingly his own thrill, but that's another way the series plays with your emotions, because the Sibyl System is bad and needs to be destroyed or reformed, but seemingly the only person who's capable of doing that is someone who isn't much better, so the only two possibilities of a future that the anime postulates to us is continuing to be controlled by the Sibyl System, or complete chaos and anarchy.  \n\n  \nAll the other characters are great too.  Nobuchika Ginoza, an inspector, is a more likable version of the traditional hard ass cop who's father and partner betrayed him in the past and become Enforcers.  That partner is Shinya Kogami, whom I mentioned before, and that father is Tomomi Masaoka, who is one of the main characters in the series too. He's a lot of fun, and his death towards the end of the series is the saddest to me in the entire anime.  This confrontation also causes Ginoa's Psycho Pass to raise way too high so he becomes an Enforcer serving under Akane by the conclusion.  The two best moments in this anime for me are that scene in episode 11, (which i think is overall the best episode too), where Shogo and Akane meet for the first time, Shogo holds one of Akane's best friends hostage and tries to goad her into killing him with a real gun.  She isn't able to betray her morals and end him, so her friend dies and she blames herself.  This is the major turning point of the series, where it becomes darker than it already was.  And the second scene I want to specifically shout out is Shogo meeting his end at the hands of Kogami in the final episode, (which may also be the best or the second best episode in the series).  As much of a monster as he was, I have to respect that there was no regret and no hesitation when he died; if anything, he was happy to be removed from a world that he fundamentally disagreed with.

For example, they are somewhat good with combat (swordsmanship, or they are a practicioner of a certain martial arts, or proficient in magic spells) or they could also be good at strategies and manage to outsmart their enemies.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are lots of anime where the villains are cartoonish. One example that I’ve seen recently is the first prince of Lihnea from episode 8 of Isekai Smartphone season 2. The dude is a straight up bastard, but when Touya confronted him and shot him 3 times (and missed on purpose), he’s a coward who fainted after begging not to be killed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBtw, I’m trying to avoid situations where they rely on others when fighting. Example is summoning a powerful demon to do their bidding.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe villains don’t have to win. They just need to be skilled enough so that they are viewed as a decent level of threat.",

It reminded me a bit of your lie in april, i want to eat your prancrease, darling in the franxx, guilty crown, etc.   \nAny other recommendations like this where the love interest or the lover himself dies? I've watched many anime where the girl dies,I love those and want more like that. But I wanna watch something where the guy dies too. Like in darling in the franxx the guy dies but it's both of them who die together. I want something where the guy dies and leaves the girl behind. In the movie I watched, the guy dies and he knows he's gonna die so he made sure the girl marries his friend before he dies. So sad. I wanna break this heart some more please.",

First half felt like a Studio Ghibli or Comix Wave film. The animation for season 1 of Chainsaw Man was good but in my opinion it is nowhere close to as good as the movie. Everything was just so god damn detailed. And don’t even get me started on the second half. My goodness. Take the animation of the fight scenes of JJK season 2 and crank it up way higher and Chainsaw Man the movie is exactly that. No dips in pacing, no flashbacks, just pure high energy fighting. And then the soundtrack, oh my god the soundtrack was so good. Usually I’d only go out to watch a anime movie if I’m a massive fan. Such as JJK 0 or One Piece Film Red. But I wouldn’t go around saying it was worth the money nor the time spent to go out and see it. Most of the time I pirate my anime. Movies included. This is not one of those times. I highly recommend finding time to go out and watch it in theatres. That movie is worth every penny I swear. It was so good that I dare say I might go out again to watch it. 10/10 movie.",

It's so fucking annoying.\n\nThanks! Hopefully you can find something!",

I would like to watch something that has a similar feeling of emotion, but most importantly trying to at  \n  \nI am looking for a something quite specific and I will try to explain exactly what I mean by this. \n\nI think what I loved about this the most this anime is a combination of it being gut-wrenching but also very thought-provoking. As much as I loved stuff like Made in Abyss or Madoka, they never quite made me think about it on a deeper level. I felt like \"holy fuck they are going through some shit, this is hard to watch\".\n\nTakopi's Original Sin made me feel insanely sad for the characters, even though I didn't really know them well. It wasn't just emotional, but it was clearly trying to say something, to make the viewer think about their own life. It had a message that was given through absolutely devastating storytelling.\n\nAnother Anime that gave me a similar feeling was Frieren. Obviously it wasn't that emotional, but it made me actually reflect on my own life, and most shows don't do that even if they are really well written.\n\nI am not just looking for \"something with a message\" or \"something emotional\", I feel like I why liked Takopi's Original Sin so much was because it had a combination of heartbreaking, but really well-written and realistic characters, while also trying to spread a message.   \n  \nMaybe the closest I can think of is Violet Evergarden, but the ending of it ruined it quite a bit for me, but the general idea was there.\n\nI hope someone will understand roughly what I am looking for. Sorry if I'm not specific enough, but I find the feeling of loving the writing but at the same time nearly feeling sick watching the show hard to put into words.",

    "content": "Your ranking them by the complexity of the animation not the titles, as any studio could of received those titles to work on.\n\nIll go first.\n\nI think the best animation studio is unfotable! UBW is one of the best new age animations, of course you have animations like ghost in the shell where every little detail his drawn in complex ways, but today the approach is more lax and less intensive. And out of all studios, ubw, heavens feel are some of the best animations. The sound design, the particle effects, the environmental damage etc, the fight scenes, they really push the limits of what good animation can look like. They also made the garden of sinners too and demon slayer.\n\nMappa is good too, but the animations always seem not complete. Like the new reze movie, it was good, but some of those fight scenes was like reading berserk! And if your viewers cant understand what they are viewing due to it being too complex or not enough time put into certain frames or scenes to flesh out the shot, it is not good. Similar issue with the sukana fight, maybe a couple more months on that fight would of made it the best fight seen every made, but as it was, it was poor. They also made very inconsistent animation, and from what ive heard they hire freelance animators rather than inhouse like unfotable.\n\n  \nEDIT: Lets do a fun game! Link the best scenes from the anime studio that you think is the best. \n\nHeres two! \n\nFate ubw / Arch vs lancer - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88eVTO9\\_IHA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88eVTO9_IHA)\n\nHeavens feel 3 / Rider vs saber - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0XT0\\_sYqlc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0XT0_sYqlc)",

How does studios that are known for not so good graphics got really popular IPs? For example 8bit was never known for having great visuals (I still don't know how they pulled of Blue Lock season 1 to look so good) and even if they had good graphic how do they even menage to get their hands on Blue Lock as it was one of the best selling manga. You would think that every major studio would beat them in the attempt but their got it somehow. And second example JC Staff they are also known for not having best graphic on the market so how did they get their hands on OPM that require really outstanding visuals just like in season 1. Can someone explain to me how this process works I only know that the author of the series don't have the ability to personally pick the studio to adapt his series but usually can pick from the list of the studios that was handed to him. So Is it because certain studio give more money to the author for adapting their work or it's just that mangakas don't recognize if studio has bad reputation or just don't care as long as it's adapted.",

    "content": "I was born in the 90s. Grew up on Dragonball Z, Gundam Wing, and other Toonami shows. Got back into anime around 2008ish and binged One Piece, Bleach, Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist,Clannad and other series. Finally, started watching seasonal anime around the time Fate/Zero's first season came out. \n\n  \nAround these times I was the kid/teen watching subtitled anime on my PC, while my brother(who still watches anime with me to this day) was sitting right beside me for every episode. In uncomfortable seats, but we didn't care.  I remember us deciding to not go to the Senior Dance at our high school and spend the night watching the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, Vampire Hunter D movie, and Kara no Kyoukai Movie 7 instead.\n\n  \nAnother one of my fondest memories was binging Gintama and we were on the Benizakura arc. We had our big math end of grade test that week, and we decided to save the finale of the arc for when we finished the test. So worth it too.\n\n  \nAttack on Titan started making strides in the anime world and rivaling the likes of something like Dragonball Z. Something I thought would never happen. People who normally were not into anime were getting into the series.\n\n  \nFast forward some years and we get Demon Slayer. Demon Slayer is going places I didn't think anime would ever hit in a million years. Me, my brother, and some of our closest friends went to go see Mugen Train in a theater that offered the Japanese version with English subtitles! Seeing a subtitled anime movie in theaters is something I'd never thought I'd be able to do. Still one of my most treasured memories to this day.\n\n  \nI just saw Chainsaw Man's new movie in IMAX with my brother and one of my closest friends (never been to an IMAX show before)...and it's just amazing that this medium is getting the attention it's been long overdue for. There is a lot of things wrong right now, but despite all that anime has never been in a better place than it is now.\n\n  \nGoing from that teen watching subtitled anime on a PC screen to an adult being able to watch an anime movie at IMAX that's also subtitled is something I never thought would happen in my lifetime.\n\n  \nI'm into my 30s now, and my love of anime is stronger than it ever was before. \n\n  \nWhat about ladies and gents who are younger than me? Can you believe there was a time where anime was niche? And for those of you who are the same age as me or older: How does it feel to see anime become the phenomenon it is today compared to how it was back then? ",

From what I understand, other guilds can raid treasure vaults to obtain powerful items too, yet no one else seems to use rings like Krai does. For example, Ark has a relic sword instead .\n\nAlso, I don’t remember if it was mentioned in Season 1, is the ring’s durability unlimited? It seems like most characters have no idea about the true nature of Krai’s rings, except for Lucia and Sitri. ",

However I can't stop watching Tougen Anki despite the VA being terrible (both sub and dubb), the power system and world building are obviously \"inspired\" by a few of the more popular anime that came before it, all of the characters personalities are centered around one base emotion which seems to be some form of anger so most VA's end up screaming every line like the Asta VA at the start of Black Clover, and I'm usually indifferent to fan service. I will say though as this season has progressed the show has managed to be less of a rip off of other more popular shows and put some of their own original takes on things. I'd only recommend  you  watch this anime if you enjoy action and can't figure out what to watch right before you go to sleep.\n\n\n\n\n",

Best animated movie I’ve watched to date!!\n\nIf you have the means and time please please go and watch it again one more time cuz once is definitely not enough.\n\n1- first of all Mappa and its animators and every worker from direction to sound design deserves so much praise and credit for what they put out, I feel like I underpaid for the experience I got. \n\n2- the experience of a full theatre watching an anime movie is something truly special, especially when I don’t live in a big city. \n\nI remember 6 years ago pre pandemic going to watch an anime movie and the theatre being completely empty and the showings were like on one specific day, it makes me so happy that the whole theatre not only applauded but sat through the credits to watch the end credits scene. Anime has come so far and it truly amazing. \n\n3- I saw so many people in full cosplay in the theatre, it was so nice to witness.\n\n4- having read the manga going in and knowing the story, it still blew it out the water, they captured this arc so perfectly. \n\nSpoilers ahead if you haven’t watched the movie:\n\nThe pool scene with the soundtrack was done so beautifully\n\nThe ending with Reze running back and being so close to being reunited with Denji was heartbreaking knowing what Makima did to her. \n\nBeam for me was so clutch the whole movie, since it had been a while I totally forgot about him being there lol.\n\nAnd finally, I’m so thankful to Fujimoto Sensei for creating this heartbreaking, emotional, horror, romance comedy and giving us such awesome characters. \n\nIf you’re a chainsaw man fan please please support this amazing movie and series if you have the means. \n",

    "title": "My Thoughts on Brave Witches",
    "content": "This is a series set in the same universe as Strike Witches, known as the World Witches universe, but it revolves around different characters.  While Strike Witches follows the 501st division, Brave Witches follows the 502nd division of the World Witches, I was skeptical going in because I already grew attached to the other characters over several installments and countless episodes, but I was pleasantly surprised that once again they managed to make me fall in love with a whole new cast of characters in this franchise.  I would even say just as much previously.  That, along with the equally good production values like animation, art, soundtrack, and sound design, made me enjoy this just as much as the previous installments.  It follows Hikari Karibuchi, who is a witch in training.  Her older sister, Takami Karibuchi, is a witch herself, and is a strong and well respected one.  Hikari looks up to her sister and wants to follow in her footsteps.  After Takami is injured and put into a coma from an accident while in battle, her squad needs someone to replace her, and Hikari jumps at the opportunity and is chosen.  However when she joins the team she realizes that she's not as welcome as she was hoping, despite being Takami's sister.  So the series involves her not only helping the other witches fight the Neuroi aliens, getting stronger, and also trying to earn the approval of her new team, especially that of Naoe Kanno, who was extremely close with Takami and doesn't seem to care that Hikari is her sister.  \n\n  \nLike I said before, this series was very enjoyable.  I like how it's not entirely a retread of the original series.  There are obviously many similarities.  There's lots of action which is well animated and intense, the girls are likable and adorable, and it's overall fun to watch.  But there are unique additions such as character motivation.  They all want to fight the Neuroi of course, but many of the other girls, especially Naoe, doesn't get along Hikari, and they have to learn to work with her, which gives us character arcs that weren't present in the original series.  I also liked that Takami does wake up from her coma by episode 10 and then her and Hikari get to work and fight together.  But that doesn't end the conflict though, as there's more fun conflict between Hikari and Takami.  I overall enjoyed it.  ",

    "content": "I’ve been into anime since I was a kid, and it’s just always been part of who I am. When I started collecting figures a few years ago, my dad started giving me a hard time about it. He keeps saying it’s childish, weird and that I’ll eventually grow out of it.\n\nI still remember the first time he said it. I just started getting waifu lootboxes and had to set up my first display shelf. He looked at the shelf and the waifus, shook his head, and said, “I truly hope you grow out of this stuff one day.” It’s been years, and if anything I’m even more into it now.\n\nIt kind of sucks though. I wish he could see that it’s not just toys to me, it’s a hobby that makes me happy. \n\nAnyone else deal with parents who just don’t get it? Is there any way I can explain this that'll make him understand? ",

It's better than Vinland Saga and AoT in terms of storytelling for me for it's sheer volumes of themes and philosophical perspectives and no second feels like filler. Berserk 1997 was also really good. Violet Evergarden I loved. Apothecary Diary is pretty damn interesting. And I feel like I need some more anime that explore the past. They just feel a lot more real and have more interesting stakes in my very personal opinion. Characters always seem more multidimensional and the stakes are very grounded. Or maybe it could be that I've finished Orb and speak out of bias.",

Here’s everything I remember:\n\n* The title was English, likely following the format: **“The story of \\[Japanese-sounding name\\] and \\[Japanese-sounding name\\]”** (e.g., *The story of Kai and Ryu*, though I might mis-remember the exact names).\n* Runtime: around **30 to 60 minutes** (maybe \\~45 min) — full anime style, not just a 5-minute clip.\n* Visual style: early-2000s shōnen-anime vibe (think Naruto, Dragon Ball Z style animation) — Japanese animation, likely dubbed or with English subtitles.\n* Plot: Two true brothers. One of the brothers enters a forest and meets a demon/goblin/evil figure.\n* That evil figure says something along the lines of **“give up your hope in exchange for power”**.\n* The brother who accepts becomes evil, gains a special eye (a mark or eye power) and turns against his brother.\n* The good brother has to confront (and I *think* kill) the corrupted brother in the end.\n* I **believe** the thumbnail or promo image had one of the brothers (either the good or evil one) prominently shown (maybe with the special eye).\n* I recall the name of one of them *might* end in “-kyu” (or something like Kyu/-kyū), but I am only about 10% sure. The names are definitely Japanese-style sounding.\n* It was uploaded on YouTube (or at least I watched it on YouTube) as a standalone video (not part of a long series).\n* The title was simple and straightforward, not a huge franchise name.\n\n  \nI will love you forever if you can help, please ive been looking for months",

    "title": "My review/analysis of the chainsaw man film",
    "content": "**What is the purpose of art?**  \nIs it to convey intricate notions that transcend the limitations of reality?  \nOr is it to serve as an experience, inundating us with its unique aesthetic?  \nI believe Chainsaw Man: The Reze arc fulfills both purposes.\n\n**Context:**  \nThe movie follows the Bomb Devil arc within Fujimoto's manga, and directly follows the events of the first season of the show. This arc is often hailed by fans as one one of the best in terms of emotional impact and characterizations (with myself included). Along with these qualities being amplified, additional content is present within the film that forms an entirely new perspective on the events in this section of the story, succeeding both as an adaptation, and a novel medium for the franchise.\n\n**The plot:**  \nWe follow Denji right after the events of the Katana Devil arc as he navigates the various expectations of his career, and we get further insight into the ill-fated path of his brotherly figure, Aki, who has been partnered with the Angel devil Makima, his superior, is once again introduced to us and their interactions serve to shed further light on the mysteriousness surrounding her character. Shortly after, Denji meets another women named Reze, and along with her introduction to the story, an entirely new world and sense of self is introduced to our protagonist. There is more to this character than meets the eye, and the film follows the tumultuous events that form the core of this film, the relationship between Reze and Denji and its place within the cruel reality of their lives. Fujimoto is primarily to thank for the plot of this film, but it is beautifully adapted and even added to in various sections, providing a more succinct and engaging experience. The most notable example of this is within the fights of the film which greatly expand upon the source material.\n\n**Characterizations/subtext/themes (skip this section if you don't want to be spoiled):**\n\nDenji and Makima -\n\n* The film follows Denji, initially in a state where he is seemingly contempt. In his perspective, his career within public safety has reached a level of security, which serves to create dramatic irony within audiences due to our knowledge of what such a job entails. However, to our protagonist, simply having a bed and three meals a day is a coveted blessing. His innocence stemming from an impoverished background creates an easily manipulated naivety that Makima, his superior within public safety, effectively preys upon.\n* Their relationship is furthered as we are provided further insight into Makima. The act of going out with Denji is simply a means for her to garner control over the ignorant child, yet strains of genuine emotion are present. After a lengthy movie marathon that leaves them both seemingly disappointed, they reach their last film. It is labelled as a complex and obscure movie, yet its emotional core triggers tears from both Makima and Denji.\n* In this moment, the cold and calculating demeanor that Makima usually upholds is abandoned, replaced by emotion. In my belief, this stems from her desires to feel a sense of genuine connection to others, as is seen within the contents of the film they are watching. However, due to her nature as the control devil, this notion is negated. She wishes to view someone on a basis of mutuality and equality, but she is fated with the limitations of a devil. The film beautifully conveys this, focusing on the interactions between Denji and Makima and his desires to follow in her steed. Yet even he is surprised by her reaction to the final film.\n\nDenji and Reze -\n\n* Reze is on a mission, and the heart of Chainsaw Man is what she desires, literally. Her meeting Denji is not an intertwining of coincidences. On the other hand, it too is a calculated tactic she intends to use to take advantage of him. With her excessively flirtatious behaviour, he is quickly entrapped in her affection. He tries telling himself that Makima is the only women that has a hold on his heart, but doubt is created within this until it culminates into a passionate desire for Reze. Yet again, Denji is ultimately a naïve child who has been thrusted into a world that has the potential to be more dangerous than the one he previously resided within. He is an easily manipulated subject due to his child-like obsession with love/lust/sex and is frequently preyed upon. They grow closer in the café, Denji completely unaware of her ulterior motives. However, in my belief, I am under the impression that Reze was also unaware of what she is beginning to feel for her target.\n* Reze proposes to go to school together at night with Denji, and there I believe the true essence of their relationship is formed. He reveals that he has never been to school, and even at his young age he is already under the strenuous pressures of employment in a dangerous field. Reze expresses concern towards this, and while some might see it as another form of manipulation, I believe it her finding a sense of solidarity with her target. She comes to the realization that he too is a weapon, similar to her. His life has been consistently discarded at the hands of others with his only true purpose to serve as an underling to those who deem his emotions and beliefs as insignificant. It is in this moment that I believe Reze wishes their lives and fates were different. She wishes she could have met this boy under different circumstances, and in a different world. To this effect, I believe that Reze and Denji exemplify the notion of right person, wrong timing/place. The romanticists within the audiences truly wish for shared happiness between the two characters, one where there’s a mutual acknowledgement and understanding that they both so clearly lack within their own personal lives. But from the onset of this film/arc, their fate as potential lovers was doomed.\n* It is shortly after that we are revealed the true nature of Reze as a skilled assassin and the romance of their subsequent date at a firework festival is marred by this underlying notion. It is here that Reze asks Denji to run away from public safety with her. While there are many different interpretations of this interaction, I believe it serves as Reze subliminally giving Denji an ultimatum. She wants to believe in him and their potential, even if it is unrealistic. He hesitates and ultimately rejects her advances. It is through this that Reze is tragically reminded of their roles within their cruel world. She knows she must follow her commands and quickly transforms into the bomb devil, ensuing a violent battle between her and public safety, along with Denji himself.\n* Reze abandons any notions of love for Denji during this conflict through pursuing and harming him mercilessly. Denji is understandably shocked yet angered over the fact that no girl has genuinely wanted him for his own merits. In a contrasting moment to the slaw of violence present within the fight, Reze affirms that she did in fact feel affection towards him. This acts as a jarring moment to both audiences and Denji himself yet provides further insight into the true nature of their relationship. There is a potential for genuine love between the two unlike anything Denji has ever experienced with someone else, yet they are constrained by their tragic realities.\n* Their fight is a glorious affair and will be touched on further later in the review, yet it ends in a subtle and quiet moment. Denji has effectively won through submerging himself and Reze wrapped in his chains in the sea, negating her powers. They have washed up on a shore now fully regenerated. She awakes and is surprised that she has been left alive. Denji too wants to believe in what he has with Reze. Even after the revealing of her true nature and motives, even after the staining of their precious interactions, he still values her. In my opinion, Reze has triggered a growth in Denji towards faith in redemption and grace. A mature, conscious choice from Denji towards extending understanding and forgiveness towards someone who has hurt him not because it is deserved, but because he has chosen to rise above resentment and look towards the capability of Reze growing from her actions. A mutual growth. He wants to grow with Reze. She holds him, looking into his eye. She almost asks him to understand and want a fantastical life with her that she desires.\n* She teasingly mocks him and then informs that she will be running away. Denji reveals that he is prepared to leave everything behind and join her. Through this, we see the extent of the impact that Reze has left on him. He is ready to abandon the bliss and security that he has longed for his entire life within public safety to follow an incredibly dangerous path with a girl who brings no sense of certainty. He will wait at the same location that they first met, and it seems he has already made amends with leaving the life he has gained to follow a life with Reze. There is no doubt that he truly believes in the potential of Reze, a potential for mutual understanding, acknowledgment, value and ultimately love.\n* In the moment, she dismisses it, but right before leaving everything all behind, she decides to commit to a life with Denji and satisfy the similar desires she has to him. She makes her way to the café, ready to begin fulfilling the potential she has with Denji, ready to fall in love completely. Yet she is tragically killed by Makima to ensure that her pawn will not be whisked away by anything genuine.\n* Through this, the reality of their world is made apparent, and ultimately, we as the audience realize there was no realistic path for them to take together following the events of the movie that didn’t involve death. Their life together was a fantasy, and the harsh nature of fate made this obvious. Denji and Reze from the onset were simply weapons, objects to be used to satisfy the desires of others. Denji still served a purpose, yet Reze, in her attempt to disobey her orders as a weapon was simply discarded. Tragically, we are reminded once again of how well these two characters fit each other’s moulds, as both are pawns who are consistently taken advantage of to serve the purposes of others.\n* Personally, I’m never getting over this death. Denji and Reze are soul mates.\n\nAki and Angel -\n\n* Aki within this film is aware that he is fated to die a horrible death, yet he still driven by his motivation to defeat the gun devil. Within this process, he is paired with the angel devil.\n* Angel is apathetic and disengaged with life. He is described as an incredibly powerful entity, yet his lack of motivation impedes this. Aki attempts to form a bond with the devil, yet his disdain for their kind ultimately nullifies this. However, throughout the events of this film, further light is shed onto their characterizations and complexity is driven into their relationship.\n* In a climactic moment, Aki saves angel even though he is fully aware that this will cost him months of his limited life span. Through this the moral growth within Aki is apparent, as a once emotionally closed individual who was driven by vengeance has come to form an attachment to those that are even supposed to be his enemy. He chooses to save Angel, not out of duty, but a choice stemming from his moral compass to protect others that he deems deserving of such treatment.\n* Despite being a devil, Angel is gentle, regretful and weary of violence and is one of the most reasonable characters within the story. He contradicts the notions that Aki has held towards devils throughout his entire life through refusing to fight or hurt people unnecessarily, leading him to believe that not all devils are evil. Saving angel provides moral clarity, as through saving angel the time for him to seek revenge is shortened. He is driven by compassion, not vengeance, making it apparent that Aki still desires to believe in the goodness of the world.\n\nThe city mouse and the country mouse -\n\n* Within this arc and film, a recurring motif is presented with the fable of the city and country mouse. The city mouse lives lavishly within the city, feasting on a vast variety of delicious food. However, its life is dangerous and full of risks. The country mouse on the other hand, lives a far more peaceful life, yet is not given the same opportunities for delicious feasting as its counterpart.\n* Makima romanticizes the city mouse through affirming her connection towards its desire to live to the fullest extent even if it results in suffering or death. Following this train of thought leads her to believe that it attains to embracing power, sensation and dominance, even if it at the risk of herself and others.\n* The country mouse symbolizes Denji’s earlier life. Although he was steeped with debt and lived in absolute poverty, there was a level of emotional clarity that was stripped away from through being placed within the city mouse’s environment (being a public safety employee under Makima). While he is now subject the pleasures of the city, violence and moral confusion subsequently follow that presents a risk to his simple way of life. Denji is effectively manipulated to desire the benefits of living in the city even though it presents significant loss. Denji is easily seduced into believing he is living a significantly better life, but he has lost any sense of agency or peace.\n* Reze embodies a person who desires to live the life of a country mouse yet is constrained by her reality as a city mouse. She is trained, lethal and has been shaped by a harsh reality that deems her as a weapon. Regardless of this, she desires to run away with Denji and escape her cruel world. She years for the purity, safety and love of the country mouse even it means abandoning the power of her previous life. She tries returning with Denji to the peaceful life that they once lived, but the city that Makima so readily embraces and its systems of control won’t let her.\n* Angel demonstrates the existential burnout of living within the constant danger of the city mouse. He yearns for stillness and connection, but his power (draining life through touch) serves to symbolise his complete isolation from others. He too yearns for the peace of the country mouse’s life and realizes the supposed benefits of being within the city are ultimately hollow.\n\n**Animation/direction/cinematography:**\n\n* After that lengthy analysis, I wanted to also touch up on the completely original traits of the film that lie within its adaption of the manga through its unique direction and animation. The director of the film, Tatsuya Yoshihara, has created a masterpiece that provides a genuinely beautiful experience. Through his utilization of unique shots and angles, the concepts that the movie intends to express are effectively conveyed through engaging the audience with jaw-dropping angles and animation.  The film decided to deviate from the previous season's commitment to realism within its art direction and instead follow a style that was more faithful to the manga. While the previous depiction had its' merits, the movie's animation provides a more dynamic and distinct take. This is present within the quieter moments of the film that utilizes unique lighting and framing to depict subjects in an active manner. The action takes it up a further notch and Mappa’s prowess in animation is exhibited. There is an apparent dedication to symmetry that contrasts with the grittiness of the subject matter and characterizations. I will be talking about specific scenes that I believe exemplify these notions.\n\nAki and Angel discussing their beliefs and relationship while killing a devil –\n\n* A full shot utilizing a shoulder-level angle frames a height difference translating visually into a power difference between Aki who is atop a dead devil and Angel who is crouched down and observing a dying public safety officer. They discuss the decision to succinctly kill the officer and put an end to his suffering, and Angel affirms that he would rather satiate himself with the pleasure of watching the man die in pain, as ultimately his true nature is that of a devil. This affirms Aki’s belief in the evilness of devil’s and his lack of desire to form a bond with his partner. The lighting depicts the sky in an unnaturally bright red hue, symbolizing the spite within Aki towards his partner and it could also be seen as a warning for the events that will soon unfold.\n\nReze and Denji in the pool –\n\n* This scene depicts Reze teaching Denji how to swim for the first time and takes it to the next level in comparison with the manga. They both strip down and reveal their naked bodies to each other, revelling in their vulnerability. The movie takes the decision to not draw the nipples of Reze, attaining to a distinct sense of innocence and purity that initially contrasts the act they are engaging in, but then becomes the basis of the subtext of this scene. They are fully submerged within the water, with the animation fluidly depicting their bodies and expression in convergence with each other. Close-up shots depict true appreciation for one another within this moment. Through the movie’s direction, any sense of eroticism is abandoned, and what remains is the blossoming of affection and love between two characters. They are both shaded in blue, tranquil within each other’s presence.\n\nEvery single fight scene –\n\n* I cannot pinpoint one single fight scene within this film to prop up on a pedestal. Each one is glorious in its depiction and adds significantly to its source material. The animation is incredibly dynamic, using multiple impact shots to convey the erratic and violent nature of the ongoing conflict. The use of colour and lighting depicts it as horrific carnage rather than a glorified battle, and certain techniques are completely unique to this film. One that immediately comes to mind is Reze swiftly defeating the serial killer who was associated with the Typhoon devil. She is depicted in a horrific manner, and any sense of her charming and sweet allure is abandoned.\n\nIt’s just genuinely hard to put it into words how amazingly the film delivered in its visual components, which is why I truly believe the movie succeeded in being art. It effectively expressed certain themes and messages in a way that could have only been conveyed and described through a visual medium, serving as an insanely engaging experience. Jaw was dropped throughout the entire film.\n\n**Score:**\n\nKensuke Ushio delivers once again, proving that he truly is one of the greatest composers in our time. The score that consistently runs throughout the film is dynamic and fun while also proving to be incredibly emotional at times.\n\nTwo significant pieces from the score are *in the pool* and *in the sea.* These pieces feature recurring piano riffs that are played in the scenes featuring Reze, and throughout the process of the film they genuinely played a role within the process of classical conditioning.\n\nBefore conditioning -\n\n* The neutral stimulus of this score playing in an emotionally impactful scene with Reze produced no response initially, but the unconditioned stimulus of the emotional content of the scene would produce the unconditioned response of bringing tears to my eyes and feeling highly emotion.\n\nDuring conditioning -\n\n* The neutral stimulus of the score would be repeatedly presented right before the unconditioned stimulus of the emotional content, still resulting in the unconditioned response of tears to my eyes and feeling highly emotional.\n\nAfter conditioning -\n\n* At this stage, after the repeated pairings and associations, the neutral stimulus of the score has now become the conditioned stimulus and can produce the conditioned response of bringing tears to my eyes. This is because the conditioned stimulus can be presented without the unconditioned stimulus (emotional scene with Reze in it) and still produce the response of me feeling highly emotional.\n\nQuick psychology lesson, all in all the score is just beautiful.     \n\n**Voice acting:**\n\nAfter watching the movie in both dubbed and subbed, I can confidently say that in each iteration all voice actors were doing an exceptional job. While there was a slight deviation from the way I thought they would have sounded in my head while reading the manga, this is purely subjective. Each voice actor did an amazing job, but I need to highlight Makima's voice actor for both the dub and sub, Tomori Kusunoki and Suzie Yeung. Just an amazing job.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nI really felt like I needed to do this. Ever since I watched the movie it's just been constantly in my head and I needed to express these thoughts somehow. With how long winded this all is im sure it's not going to be read by many people but I'm happy I got to say what I feel about this arc and film. It's just genuinely a beautiful work of art that should be propped up. I want more people to go to the theatres and see this. Hopefully this review/analysis can at least aid that. It's crazy I should be studying for an exam right now but I needed to do this.\n\nPlease just watch the film and recommend it to as many people as possible.\n\n10/10!",

    "content": "So I have been watching anime since ig 3 months? or maybe a bit more. And yk what, I LOVE IT. I always thought of it as childish cartoons but after watching it, I realised that there are soo many values and ethics and such great feelings and emotions that I can learn from and enjoy!\n\nI fell in love with the Japanese culture asw (call me stupid 😭). \n\nSo, here are what I started watching in order and finished:-\n\n1. Attack on titan (stopped at a certain part; too complicated for me)\n\n2. Demon Slayer (amazing anime)\n\n3. Black Clover (again, a great anime)\n\n4. Solo Levelling (THE BEST IN MY OPINION)\n\n5. Gachiakuta (a very modern and different kind which i love)\n\n6. Watched One Piece until they enter the island (its been long so kinda forgot)\n\n  \nThen, I started watching romantic anime (just gave it a try)\n\n1. Watched \"The Fragnant Flower Blooms with Dignity\" because it was very popular among insta reels and saw a bunch of edits. and let me tell you, IT WAS THE BEST EXPERIENCE MY WHOLE LIFE. LIKE, EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT LOVE AND AFFECTION CHANGED!\n\n2. Watched My Dress Up Darling. let me tell you, I cried like a dog cause the ending didnt satisfy me and I want another season where things actually get real!\n\n3. Watched Horimiya. Didnt love it as in romance as much as 1 and 2, but still a great anime! It was very funny and an excellent comedy!\n\n4. Just started watching Fruits Basket but kinda unsure maybe not my thing casue I am sooo tangled up in romance that I might even start reading manga!\n\n  \nAnyways, thanks for reading the huge list. I want to watch anime which make me cry (tearjerker) and also has romance in it (A LOVE STORY WHERE THEY GET TOGETHER WITH A HAPPY ENDING AT THE END). Maybe, the guy trying to make frnds but unable to or smh as that (cause I can relate it to myself). \n\n  \nThanks for the suggestions :))\n\n4. ",

    "content": "I want to watch some cliche romance anime where two people are in love but they have to work hard to prove themselves worthy to the family and stuff. Actually I just watched a movie ( Ramaiya Vastavaiya ) where there's this girl whose only family is her brother and he's a farmer. She goes to attend the wedding of her best friend who is a rich girl, and there, the son of a rich businessman falls for her and he wins her over. Bothe are in love. But one day, when the guy wasn't around, his family mocked and shooed her and her brother away for being only a farmer's sister and trying to steal the soon away from his family, actually it's the mother who does that not the father, she's very money hungry while the father is actually a sweet father and loves to help those in need. The wife keeps scolding him for making all those donations and stuff. Anyway, when the son gets to hear this, he runs off to her village to marry her, but the brother beats him up and throws him out of the village. Their mom died of sorrow after their rich father married another woman and kicked their mom and them out of the house. He raised the girl alone. So he doesn't want to give his sister away to some money hungry rich kid who'll just toss her aside someday. So he say's he'll have to prove himself by living as a farmer himself and harvesting more crop than him and he has to take care of the cattle and milk them, and everything that a farmer does. He agrees and he wins the brother's heart even before the test was over and then he wins the bet as well so they get married. Some other nasty stuff happens in between but that's not related here. I know this might sound very lame to most but I've watched this movie so many times even though it's a cheap movie. I kinda love it. Can you suggest me some anime like this too please?",

As a lover of animation in general I thought season 1 looked fantastic but as a lover of the chainsaw man manga it kinda felt like something was missing especially after seeing look back. I’m happy with the direction the movie went in but I also feel it would be a shame if we never saw anything look like s1 again in anime. I think it would suit a much more serious series like Tokyo ghoul better. It’s also kinda similar in some ways. ",

But seriously what's the deal?? In that post they ask anime fans to respect the studio and wait for the movie to release in theatres, but hey, how about respecting the fans that are responsible for majority of the money you make from these moives???\n\nWhy release it months in advance to the Japanese people? I tried searching online, thinking they hadn't done the dubs, but apparently dubbing is done in advance, before the Japanese release for most of these movies. International fans need to wait for the movie to release and hope they don't get hit with some major spoiler by some crappy article website like gamerant or IGN, or some cringe lord making edits online. \n\nDemon slayer makes wayyy more from international fans compared to what it makes in Japan. What's the point of having a gap between releases??? Is this some bullshit national pride crap? ",

Is she a potential rival?\n\n3) How strong is the Pandora, Claudia's Orga Lux?\n\n4) We have another new girl, any opinion about Saya?\n\n5) Is Ayato really a girl magnet?\n\n6) What is this sudden dinosaur attack? Is this part of the training?\n\n***\n## Highlights from yesterday:\n\n1) there is some interesting things happening right now, as of u/frostxc3:\n\n&gt; Allekant seems like the MIT of this world so they're obviously bringing the tech. Seidoukan provides some access to data or info that Allekant wouldn't normally get, I think. Also, since Seidoukan is basically strong-arming Allekant into this collab, thanks to the Silas Mariner incident, one could imagine that Allekant is their employee as far as the development of this newer type of Lux is concerned. Though I wouldn't doubt that Ernesta has her motives for agreeing to the collab.\n\n***\n## Disclaimer notice:\n\nDear rewatchers, please be nice to the first-time watchers by simply not spoilering anything.

    "title": "Fanservice: unnecessary or enjoyable?",
    "content": "Lately there's been a lot of debate around fanservice and it seems like people seem to fall in one of two camps: those that find it unnecessary and/or creepy, and those that appreciate it or feel it wouldn't be the same without it. \n\nI used to be a part of the \"fanservice is unnecessary\" category, until I found myself... actually *enjoying* certain fanservice moments in anime!? So I had to question myself on why this was happening and if it made me a hypocrite. Here's what I discovered: \n\nNot all fanservice is created equal. I had to analyze why I enjoyed certain fanservice moments in some anime while I hated others, and I found that the key difference was 2 things: \n\n1. The fanservice made sense narratively \n\n2. The fanservice made sense considering the relationship between the characters \n\nWhat I mean by that is: when a fanservice moments makes sense within the story and isn't there \"just because\", it's much more enjoyable. And when a fanservice moment happens as a result of a deepening relationship between two characters, it feels natural instead of forced.  \n\nBut when the fanservice is clearly written just to keep the audience engaged through various panty shots and jiggle physics, it feels like the writer doesn't trust that the watcher cares about their story enough so they're throwing some bait out there to reel them in. Also, there's a lot of very problematic fanservice out there too that involves characters that look like little kids, as well as fanservice moments that border on sexual assault. \n\nHere are some examples of fanservice moments I liked vs didn't like (spoilers ahead)\n\n[Apothecary Diaries] &gt;!The frog scene. It took me by surprise considering the anime thus far had been an *extremely * slow burn that loved to tease the audience with a lot of \"will they won't they\" moments. But I think if this scene had happened in the first season it wouldn't be as enjoyable. But nearing the end of season 2, Jinshi and Maomao had become a lot closer and began to understand each other more. Also, a huge part of the story is that Jinshi isn't actually a eunuch. And because Maomao doesn't like to make conjecture without solid evidence, it makes sense that she had to... feel that evidence. This scene did have some controversy due to Jinshi's reaction, but that's a discussion for another day. I'm talking purely about fanservice here.!&lt;\n\n[Chainsaw Man] &gt;!I've seen this show get a lot of hate because \"Denji is just a perv who only cares about boobs\". That tells me people don't understand his character. Narratively, he is a deeply damaged person who equates physical touch and sex with being loved. He needs meaning in life and seeks to find it in women. I like that he asked Power's consent to touch her and waited for her full permission. (and throughout the entire story Denji never touches anyone without consent, in fact he's the one who gets assaulted and groomed.) And to me the most important part was him coming to the realization that boobs *aren't* the meaning of life. As well as the fact that at that point in the story Denji and Power had become quite close and had a great dynamic happening of rivals and friends.!&lt; \n\n[My Dressup Darling] &gt;!This one's interesting because at first glance it seems to fall into the category of simple audience gratification and doesn't match my relationship criteria considering Marin undresses in front of Gojo in the very first episode. But I found myself really enjoying the show -- Marin and Gojo are both very quirky individuals that don't fit in with the status quo. Marin is a very straightforward person and comfortable in her own body so narratively it made sense that she wouldn't see an issue with showing off to her classmate. And I liked that Gojo isn't a simp, but also clearly has desires that he has to work around. I love the way their relationship progresses and they become closer as friends and more than that, and I think the later fanservice moments (the hotel scene for example) help to illustrate them becoming more comfortable with each other as they are with themselves.!&lt; \n\nNow for some I didn't enjoy: (keep in mind this isn't about the shows as a whole, just the fanservice moments within them) \n\n[Summertime Rendering] &gt;!It felt like the show was trying too hard to justify the fanservice moments in the show by retroactively having them be relevant to the plot somehow. For example, the panty shot of Miyo falling off her bike was \"important\" because then Shinpei could remember that she had striped panties and wasn't a Shadow! And the boob grabbing thing was \"important\" because it gave him a reason to interact with Hizuru who becomes an important character later! The panty shot thing was icky to me because that was his foster sister (who also looks and acts like a kid) and the boob grab was icky because Hizuru was obviously not okay with it hence the slap. So see how this one fails my two criteria? The relationship dynamic didn't match, and the plot points tried to make sense, but ultimately fell short as I think there would be much better ways to write it!&lt;\n\n[Bakemonogatari] &gt;!This one gave me the biggest ick of all. It's been a while since I've seen it so my memory is a little fuzzy, but the scene of Araragi chasing around and groping the little ghost girl on the playground truly disgusted me. That's all I have to say on that. It was just plain gross and was completely unnecessary and failed my relationship and narrative criteria with flying colors. I've heard that he does go through some character development later on, but he's just a straight up pedophile and there's no justifying that or growing from it in my books. I really wanted to like this series as I love the storytelling style and artistic direction, but watching it gave me a visceral disgust reaction.!&lt; \n\nIf you made it all the way to the end, thank you! I'd love to know your thoughts below. Feel free to (respectfully) disagree and tell me why, or if you agree tell me your own examples of the best and worst fanservice moments! \n\n&gt; TL;DR: I used to think all fanservice was pointless or creepy, until I realized I only dislike it when it’s forced or disconnected from the story. When fanservice fits the narrative and makes sense for the characters’ relationship, it can actually add depth. But fanservice that's *only* there for the audience and not the story is not what I enjoy, especially if it's creepy. \n",

A funny reference, I thought.\n\nInstead, I found a beautifully, and I mean ***beautifully*** crafted anime with stunning visuals, an intriguing setting and a hooking premise: a group of people trapped in a spaceship, with one of them being a shapeshifter. They’ll only survive if they can uncover which one of them is the lying alien.\n\n[GNOSIA, Episode 1](https://preview.redd.it/fownhaxunxwf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6145ab357957d1802d4291da634cf3b8d7b465c3)\n\n\n\nThere's more to it, both in terms of plot (as the narrative paradigm of \"*let's identify the blackened*\" opens up to broader twists) and of what the anime offers technically:\n\n* **The soundtrack.** A banger composed by Fukasawa Hideyuki (*Fate/Stay Night: UBW, To Be Hero X, Aku no Hana*). [Listen ](https://spotify.link/JbvBwjI7HXb)to a representative, evocative example.\n\n[GNOSIA, Episode 1](https://preview.redd.it/wprgbwo8rxwf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce1e4aa661162bd89c42b3daa242c1fdcbbd685e)\n\n* **It’s a choral story**, with many characters constantly interacting. They’re incredibly colorful and visually distinctive. Each one feels unique and carries their own kind of charisma: sometimes cool and mysterious, sometimes sensual, sometimes whimsical. They’re simply fascinating to watch.\n* It’s based on a visual novel with a **strong reputation and high rankings**. Many players describe the game as fantastic, we may be in for a ride.\n\n[GNOSIA, Episode 1](https://preview.redd.it/ar4xjwberxwf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52f8d9eeefafb27ce457d591983860bc7615c2eb)\n\nIt’s been a while since I found an anime that sits right at the crossroads of everything I love most in storytelling: *a good mystery*, *aesthetically refined characters*, great animation with *stunning camera work* and visuals, science fiction with a survival-game element, debates among characters about truth and lies, incredible music, and that addictive hook that makes you want to keep watching.\n\n[GNOSIA, Premiere Key Visual ](https://preview.redd.it/ofxju7dgrxwf1.jpg?width=3744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da72ef650f1403f3a8c3d9a0e7cdd992d2191cc9)\n\nI haven’t played the game, but I’m so in for this ride. The anime will have 21 episodes across two cours, which players say should be enough to cover the full story.\n\nAnyone as excited as I am?

    "title": "My Thoughts on Strike Witches: Road to Berlin",
    "content": "I enjoyed the slice of life spinoff of the Strike Witches series, but it's nice to get back to the main series.  This is the most recent one from 2020.  At the start the main character, Yoshika Miyafuji, still doesn't have her magic back yet.  This puts her in an interesting position where she is still technically the main character, but she isn't able to take part in the battles until the end.  We follow her trying to grapple with this, while also trying to find a way to get her magic back, in addition with the normal drama between the girls having to do with combat and the military tactics and everything like that.  It's just as good as the previous main action heavy seasons.  Maybe even better at times.  Not much, but I did notice that the animation was marginally improved.  I already said before how the animation is better in this series that it needed to be, and I think in this season the crispness, fluidity, and frequency of movement, not to mention the amount of moving characters and attacks on screen at once, has been increased a tiny bit, which is cool to see.  Beyond that though, everything else is just as good as in the first two seasons.  The girls are all adorable, the action is entertaining and intense, the interactions between the characters are funny, wholesome, likable, and heartwarming, and sometimes dramatic but it always ends satisfyingly.  And it was great to see Yoshika Miyafuji get her magic back by the end of the series and able to join the conflict directly once again.  But even before that she's still able to make herself useful by using traditional medical knowledge to help soldiers, and also by providing emotional support, which in an anime like this is arguably just as important as the magic and the weapons.

I am in need of a new anime to watch, hoping to start a list of shows that are decent and I won't get bored after the first couple episodes (I usually give shows a good 3-4 episodes before dropping them). Anyway I'm into pretty much everything and have hidive, crunchyroll, netflix, hulu, and Amazon prime as far as anime streaming services go. (I refuse to watch shows that are unavailable in this way just saying). \n\nSome shows that I am interested in are Tokyo Revengers, Dr. STONE, Sleepy princess in the demon castle, haikyuu!, parasyte, hunter x hunter, devil man cry baby, The fragrant flower blooms with dignity, Fruits Basket, kimi ni todoki, Dandadan, Death note, MHA, the apothecary diaries, jujutsu kaisen, Saiki K, Demon Slayer, rising of the shield hero, The summer Hikaru died, the way of the house husband, and there are more but I figured that was enough to get the gist.\n\nI like really anything and everything however there are some shows I will not watch. I.e. redo of healer, rurouni Kenshin, jojos (I know I just can't get past the art and the first season was terrible imo), the seven deadly sins, full metal alchemist, inuyasha, vampire knight, and sailor moon. \n\nShows that I'm working on watching goes Your lie in April, mononoke, Evangelion, hells paradise, all things junji ito, ranma 1/2, one piece, and black clover. \n\nThere are alot of shows that I have seen is wish I could link MAL but thats not a thing. I've explored most shows I'm just trying to find some new ones that will have me watching anime again because I miss the joy that it brought me. I used to be a seasonal watcher, but with work and life it's gotten hard to sit down and watch a show anymore. I'm not necessarily looking for anything specific just some shows that would be good to pass time.\n\nAnyways thank you for reading this and I look forward to tour suggestions! ",

    "content": "This is a bit different from the installments I've watched so far.  It's Soul Eater Not to Soul Eater or Attack on Titan Junior High to Attack on Titan, it's basically just a slice of life spinoff of the main Strike Witches series.  I guess that means it's not inherently as different as those other spinoffs are as Strike Witches has always had some slice of life elements to it, but this series focuses entirely on that.  There's no combat whatsoever.  Even in episode 9 when they say they're going to start training, they never actually train and it just comes down to a bunch of jokes.  But that's not a criticism for me, not only because this series is meant to serve a different purpose than the main Strike Witches series, but also because, like I said before, the main series had slice of life elements anyways, this just pushed them to the forefront.  And I liked it.  Arguably it even makes the humor a bit better at points, although not tremendously.  The episodes are also shorter than normal, only around 13 minutes a piece give or take a few seconds, so it doesn't take very long to watch.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  ",

It was about this kid who got recruited into some kind of hero school/program thing. There were 2 other main characters, one male and one female. Right at the end they find the mcs brother in some kind of jail or asylum. \n\nIt probably wasn’t even very good, but I’m pissed that I just can’t remember what it was.",

I’m not gonna say I’m a huge fan of anime but as mentioned I’ve seen a few. I keep seeing certain anime’s pop up on my twitter and they look interesting so I have them bookmarked.\n\nAny recommendations? I’m a big fan of action type anime’s. Sure the “romance” anime’s are nice but it’s not for me.\n\nIn terms of what platforms I have. I currently have Netflix and Disney +hulu combo. I’m also thinking about getting Crunchyroll but I may wait until I’ve finished everything on Netflix and Disney before having another subscription. \n\nAlso I would prefer a quick show maybe a season or two. Definitely not something if it’s got more than 5 seasons or so, like one piece for example. I’m tryna speed run through these bc ik I’m missing out on a lot so time is not exactly on my side…\n\nBut anyway, thanks for the recommendations and good day/night to you all! \n\n\n",

All i know is that the main character is a boy with (i think) blonde or brown hair, he had some sort of big hat that MAYBE covered his eyes!?!? \n\nThe scene: He wakes up after what i think is a times kip, he’s still a boy/teen while his friends are all adults now. The girl, who i believe had green hair? She’s tan and is married now (i think… anyways it was to a guy.) and they all were friends when they were kids. The setting was inside of the woman and mans house, which was wooden. And the grass was very vibrant outside, the sky was very blue. It wasn’t a sci-fi anime or anything like that. It was definitely fantasy. The art style was not like most anime’s. It was similar to Pokémon Horizons and other shows like that. pleaseee help me find this show again!!",

Don't get me wrong I like the main series that has not only the cuteness and comedy but also surprisingly good action, animation, and likable characters, but this is fun too.  Just watching these adorable characters interact with each other in everyday life situations, exaggerated sure, but still everyday life situations.  It's extremely laid back and relaxing, and that's just what I need sometimes.  I do wonder why this wasn't released with the main Joint Fighter Wing series, other than the fact that it's 30 minutes long and those episodes were just 13 minutes long, because it just came out later the same year, 2019, and is literally exactly the same in terms of plot and structure.

    "content": "Hallo, ich bin seit einer ganzen Weile auf der verzweifelten Suche nach einem Anime (theoretisch könnte es Film oder Serie gewesen sein). Thema war Himmel und Hölle. Ich habe den Anime im TV gesehen und dachte eigentlich, dass der Titel mit \"Heaven und Hell\" angegeben wurde oder der Themenabend so hieß, ich habe dazu aber nichts gefunden. Ich denke der Anime lief auf Arte, aber auch Arte könnte mir meine Nachfrage nicht beantworten. \n\nInhalt des Anime waren Geschichten von Menschen, die Sünden begangen haben und in die Hölle mussten. Achtung Triggerwarnung (Gewalt!):\n\nEine Geschichte handelte von einer Frau um die 40, die von einem Engel die Nachricht bekam, dass sie heute Abend sterben wird und dann in den Himmel kommt, weil sie ein sündenfreies Leben geführt hat. Als Sie nach Hause kommt, trifft sie allerdings dort auf ihren Mann, der gerade fremd geht und in ihrer Wut bringt sie ihn (oder beide) um und muss daraufhin in die Hölle. \n\nIn einer anderen Geschichte des Anime ging es um einen jungen Mann, der in der Hölle von Dämonen gejagt wurde. Als sie ihm gegangen haben, wollten sie dem Mann häuten. Er hatte allerdings die Wahl sich in eine noch tiefere Höllensphäre zu begeben, um sich der Häutung zu entziehen, dort erwartet ihm allerdings etwas noch schlimmeres. \n\nWeiteres habe ich nicht gesehen, ich würde den Anime extrem gerne anschauen. Kennt den irgendjemand und kann mir helfen? Ich habe bereits Jahre danach in Anime Listen gesucht und absolut nichts gefunden. \n\nTechnisch bzw. optisch war der Anime gut gemacht und stammt schätzungsweise aus der Zeit von 2000 bis 2015. \n\nVielen Dank für eure Mühen!",

There's the appreciation for animation and visual art. Some of the vibes of shows like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun just feel like serotonin. I've learned so many life lessons from anime as well. They seem to live in a world that makes sense, where people believe in each other and work together towards a common goal.  Some characters are inspiring and teach you to believe in yourself. And it's nice to imagine yourself in a yourself in a world where you have close friends, where people talk openly and speak plainly. \n\nI don't know, there's something special about this medium that goes a little beyond \"good story and pretty pictures.\" Can't explain it.

This is probably my favorite.\n\nI recently finished\n\nSolo Leveling- i thought it started kinda slow but I really got into it the more I watched it.\n\nGachiakuta- loving this so far but now it’s a two week wait on the dubbed versions for new episodes.\n\nDr Stone- really enjoyed this one! Granted I’m sucker for anything post apocalyptic\n\nKaiju no8- I held off on starting this one because I’ve never really been fan Godzilla type things but this one was awesome and I can’t wait for season 3.\n\nDemon Slayer- Fantastic!! Loved it can’t wait to finally watch the move but it wasn’t playing anywhere near me so I’m having to wait.\n\nAttack on Titan- started slow but by the mid way was loving it.\n\nHigh School DxD- this was referred to me as a more risqué anime so thought I’d check it out. I was actually enjoying the story and of course the animation was fun to watch but I’ve had a hard time watching after they changed up the English voice actors.\n\nMy Hero Academia- my daughter loves this one and I’ve seen bits and pieces of it but not enough to know if I want to try and watch everything.\n\nSo these are some that I’ve finished recently and would love recommendations on something else to dive into.",

I'll just assume Silas Norman was busy prepping more killbots off screen during that conversation\n\n&gt; So, does that Ayato dialogue lock him into the Julis route? Before they introduce the rest of the girls? You know this actually did make me recall that this had a visual novel or at least a game with visual novel elements. It was PSP or the Vita? Must have been the Vita because it would line up better timewise and I specifically remember buying a used one in college. The PS Vita library was super shallow so I may have actually played it?\n\n&gt; Hmmm, new purple hair girl for a new arc teased in the Claudia L2D segment. Will Saya eventually get her time to shine, or will she be done dirty as the childhood friend?\n\n&gt; Silas Norman\n\n***\n## Disclaimer notice:\n\nDear rewatchers, please be nice to the first-time watchers by simply not spoilering anything.

    "content": "This might be a dumb question, but it just came to my mind. If I understand correctly in one punch man's hero association ranking and classes work like this; \n\nIf a hero rises to C rank number 1, they can move up B rank starting from the bottom. If they reach A class number 1, they can move up to S class. \n\nSo if C class number 1 becomes B class, then the C class number 2 becomes number 1. Doesn't the new number 1 also get the right to move up to B class? By that logic, every hero should eventually rise to S class. And the only reason this doesn't happen is that every number 1 hero doesn't want to move up. Mumen rider because he doesn't think he deserves to be B class, Fubuki becasue she has an organization made of B classes and she wants to control them, and sweet mask because being A class number 1 is better for his image. \n\nI might have misunderstood the whole class system tho. \n\nAnd finally if you think this a dumb thing to get caught up on, your'e right it is. OPM is a parody of battle shonen and the class system is also a parody of the power scaling systems. Anyway want to hear your thoughts",

A lot of the work we do is in animé/manga events, so I thought it would be interesting to try to make a connection between these arts.\n\nI'm wondering if you guys know characters and/or stories that feature sashiko and/or sashiko patterns. It would be amazing to share this art among the manga/animé lovers.\n\nI added a few images of traditional sashiko patterns.\n\nAnything would be useful!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7rh57sj9ywf1.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee57b0d09a17c558cb9a75b3e33ef6e1f765bda0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqoponrj9ywf1.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4587e11d532150693e2498f573593f2fdaafae16\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wd5brorj9ywf1.png?width=912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f0f0420368920896f7dc9dfd9f7d89357f9e1a2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sylxgnrj9ywf1.png?width=1222&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2678cbbec78ee24df102bc173970173ad9bc43db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9qvpnrj9ywf1.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c10280834146fce57f689cc83579fc0512a3765\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qc1eonrj9ywf1.png?width=1014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18ba227247a80c81e6c4ad2f967559029ab391c8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sja2uorj9ywf1.png?width=1120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ea119f941b8e6addabf0ed6f603f6c64109f6f2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7el4knrj9ywf1.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fd2ddc9a6fe265be8ddcbb71a0c3299441fcbf6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cpqfarsj9ywf1.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2871a6c08f83fbdf426e292185f644d3a774ac90\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i0gvkdsj9ywf1.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0f796fa21c8d0e939a3f714d4329e69f137a528\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/teg0anrj9ywf1.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d898835f500c294484a879d87e581106f0dadc5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuw1anrj9ywf1.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4c92d9875e07bcea865a8253111750bb93fb6e7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4omgfnrj9ywf1.png?width=356&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17eda00fa8bbe2620e59f3d72c129e2b1bc9c492\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ut80borj9ywf1.png?width=368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=084ac9630ba4c80efda2ecb560a6951a931eb8af\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3j06jnrj9ywf1.png?width=384&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=778eea94d55aed40c63cd2acaf04edc0a055fcca\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n0wc9wj9ywf1.png?width=372&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70076ea883545cd0764b0c91659d195fa378b1b1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lg6wuqrj9ywf1.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52aef34a362f91cbc47188f9ff0d6172e19100ea\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7m9xzrj9ywf1.png?width=448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=144f13a1eb7cb7642f1cee7107a25bd6405911b5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mii6qorj9ywf1.png?width=438&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27b8b11840e785fa421e7f131398b348b21118b4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2v2gprj9ywf1.png?width=404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8460b1bd9b704430495a4336db0a37314f47b858\n\n",

Like I said before this anime is not incredible, but it's just a good old fashioned fun ride.  The best part about it is that it EARNS me having fun.  I always hate when I criticize an anime and I get the response that I should just \"turn my brain off and have fun.\"  True fun is earned through actual effort and this anime has shown that effort in its writing.  The characters aren't just cute they're likable and granted not the deepest but they are interesting, especially the protagonist.  Funnily enough that said protagonist isn't in this anime at all except for a very brief cameo at the end.  At first glance it might seem like a pointless OVA, but considering this entire series is a fun romp with likable characters battling aliens, this OVA basically just does everything that the series does in shorter form.  It's similar to what I said about the movie, it's like three normal episodes, except the main heroine isn't present.  And it's good.  ",

    "title": "My Thoughts on Strike Witches The Movie",
    "content": "I'm kind of surprised that an anime like this got such a large franchise out of it.  There's obviously way bigger franchises in anime, but I've only watched 2 seasons so far and a movie, and there's still more seasons of Strike Witches, plus Brave Witches, and Luminous Witches; the last two follow different characters, but are set in the same universe.  But anyways, I like this movie just as much as I did the first two seasons.  Just like them it's no masterpiece but it's shockingly entertaining, wholesome, and enjoyable.  I love how mostly lighthearted it is.  In some ways it could be considered slightly better because it has a films budget, but the animation of the series was already, while nowhere close to the best I've ever seen, better than anyone could reasonably expect, so I don't think it's leaps and bounds better here.  The girls are still cute.  Plot wise at the end of season 2 the main character, Yoshika Miyafuji, lost her magical abilities, so she can't be a witch anymore.  Obviously she got her magic back by the end of the movie, but that's still something she has to grapple with, as well as her desire to still be a doctor.  She gets an offer to travel to Europe to go to medical school, and so she does that, but of course she does get involved in conflicts once again because the movie would be pretty boring if it was just an hour and a half of her studying in class.  This is basically just a longer episode of the show, or perhaps three episodes stuck together, functionally.  ",

Denji is who Eren Yeager wished he were. \n\nThe animation was fun and expressive for the fights and funny scenes; however, I wished they had kept the season 1 cinematography/animation for the romantic and slow scenes. Let's start a petition to get Ryu Nakayama (season 1 director) back for the slow scenes.   \n\nIt's faster-paced than season 1. Wish they lingered on shots longer for the slower scenes. \n\nMusic is beautiful, especially during the pool scene, if you didn't get that scene cut in your country.\n\nThe bomb devil is so cool and perfect for the movies, with her flashy explosions and loud noises, making it a perfect experience for the movies. Along with the hurricane devil and Beam, the shark devil really made it a lot of fun to watch.",

    "title": "animerank.top - A website for grouping anime entries as franchises for better rankings (solving the Gintama problem)",
    "content": "[https://animerank.top](https://animerank.top)\n\nI created a website for grouping anime entries as franchises.\n\nThe goal of this is mainly for better ranking (I'm looking at you, Gintama) and for better browsing instead of manually traversing MAL webpage or anilist to explore a series. MAL's data for anime relations is really complex like performing graph traversal on Gintama with \"Other\" relation type returns 700+ entries as a single franchise which is really bad.\n\n**After many experiments, this is the best filter I came up with to group franchise entries.**\n\n* Included: `Prequel, Sequel, Alternative Version, Side Story, Summary, Full Story, Spin-Off, Parent Story`.\n* Excluded: `Alternative Setting, Character, Other`.\n\n**MAL Anime Relation Types**\n\n* `Alternative Setting` can be anything, but one example I found is \"Steins Gate\" having an \"Alternative Setting\" entry called \"ChäoS;HEAd\" which I believe should NOT be counted as one franchise in the context of anime rankings. So I decided to exclude Alternative Setting.\n* `Alternative Version` on the other hand is mostly remakes. It is good to include this. It's explained below in the Remakes section.\n* `Character` relation type is mostly character crossovers. Example: Isekai Quartet which is connected to a bunch of series. So I decided to exclude this in grouping too. BUT, my code algorithm actually processes Isekai Quartet as its own Franchise which is a good thing.\n* `Other` relation type is a whole can of worms. When I included this in the code and processed Gintama, it returned 700 interconnected series as a single franchise. I said NO and removed it from the code.\n* `Prequel, Sequel, Alternative Version, Side Story, Summary, Full Story, Spin-Off and Parent Story` is the final inclusion list for franchise grouping. The highest entry count for this is called \"Sore Ike! Anpanman\" at 105 entries followed by \"Mobile Suit Gundam\" at 99 entries.\n\n# The MATH\n\nOkay, everyone's favorite subject. I made 5 different scoring models that you can use to sort the anime ranking in the website.\n\n* **Weighted Combined (WC)** \\- Score weighted by both popularity and duration within the franchise. Combines both popularity and duration weighting for the most comprehensive score. Longer content × more users = indicates high relevance of the entry. The website defaults to this in the ranking page.\n* **Weighted Popularity (WP)** \\- Score weighted by number of scoring users within the franchise. Avoids sequel bias - [some sequels have fewer users but higher scores](https://i.imgur.com/cBZGyus.png), so weighting by users prevents this inflation. Side stories and OVAs with low user counts have minimal impact.\n* **Weighted Duration (WD)** \\- Score weighted by total duration within the franchise. Prevents short OVAs, specials, and side stories from skewing the franchise score. [Longer main content has appropriate influence](https://i.imgur.com/YXvzZVY.png).\n* **Peak Entry Score (PEAK)** \\- The highest individual score among all entries in the franchise. Simple and can sometimes be accurate - shows the franchise's best entry. e.g. [One Piece Fan Letter will carry the franchise](https://i.imgur.com/wYXbz4T.png).\n* **Average Score (AVG)** \\- Simple average of all anime scores in the franchise. Highly inaccurate - treats all entries equally regardless of relevance. Short OVAs, specials, and side stories can heavily skew the score.\n\n# Remakes\n\nLet me show you a real example of how this works with [Hunter x Hunter](https://i.imgur.com/DWVYc5C.png):\n\n* **Hunter x Hunter (1999)**: 8.43 score, 633,308 users, 62 episodes\n* **Hunter x Hunter (2011)**: 9.03 score, 3,088,905 users, 148 episodes\n\nThe 2011 remake has a higher individual score (9.03 vs 8.43) and way more users (3M vs 633K), but when calculating franchise scores:\n\n**From best to worst:**\n\n1. **Weighted Combined (WC)**: **8.98** \\- The recommended approach (website default) - balances both popularity and duration weighting\n2. **Weighted Popularity (WP)**: **8.74** \\- The 2011 version dominates because it has 5x more users\n3. **Weighted Duration (WD)**: **8.72** \\- The 2011 version has more influence (148 eps vs 62 eps)\n4. **Peak Entry Score (PEAK)**: **9.03** \\- The 2011 version's score (highest individual entry)\n5. **Average Score (AVG)**: **8.00** \\- Simple average of all entries (treats OVAs and movies equally)\n\n# Shorts, Specials, OVAs, etc\n\nLooking at the Hunter x Hunter data, you can see how the weighted formulas handle irrelevant entries:\n\n* **Hunter x Hunter Pilot (1 episode, 31K users)**: 7.21 score - barely affects the franchise score\n* **Movies (1 episode each, \\~200K users)**: 7.28-7.29 scores - minimal impact despite decent user counts\n* **Main TV series (62-148 episodes, 633K-3M users)**: 8.43-9.03 scores - long duration with high number of users dominates the calculation.\n\nThe Weighted Combined formula considers both duration AND popularity, so a 1-episode OVA with low user count gets almost no weight compared to a 148-episode TV series with 3M+ users. This prevents short specials from skewing franchise rankings while still including them for better browsing experience.\n\n# Issues, Data Errors, Feedback Form\n\nThere are some franchises that are extremely complex. An example is the Go Nagai Franchise. The automated code fails to group this properly so I had to make some custom config to apply a fix. It's still not fully fixed but I've at least separated the most obvious parts like Devilman (8 entries, this contains Crybaby).\n\nI've made a feedback form so you guys can submit any issues you find. Or if you believe a certain franchise should be grouped in a certain way. I am sure there are some errors lingering around right now that I haven't found yet.\n\n[https://animerank.top](https://animerank.top)",

    "title": "My Thoughts on Strike Witches Season 1",
    "content": "This is an interesting and fun anime. It follows a group of young girls who are basically soldiers and fight in a war with alien creatures known as the Neuroi. They use this weird technology allowing them to fly and they use massive guns in combat which they use to fire bullets that I'm pretty sure are made out of magic. So it's kind of like a science fantasy story, where the characters utilize both futuristic technology and magic to fight. The most instantly notable aspect is the way the girls dress, which basically consists of a white t-shirt and short shorts. The creator claimed that this is just the \"fashion\" of young girls in this world. I've seen some people make fun of this and call it ridiculous, but honestly I don't think so. If you've seen some of the countless fashion trends in the real world, both right now and throughout history, this wouldn't even make the top 500 dumbest. Is it really just an excuse for fanservice? Yeah probably, especially considering many of the camera angles. But I can still accept this as an actual style of fashion in the series' universe, it's unique and adds a bit more dimension to the worldbuilding, and makes most of the fanservice seem more diegetic than a lot of other ecchi anime.  \n  \nI was surprised how much fun I had with this anime. The animation is way better than it ever had to be given the premise and content, and the sound design was also good too. I don't normally talk about that but I'm so glad that the explosions in the battles didn't have this terrible compression that so many low quality slop anime, and even some other anime that are otherwise high quality, have. That super compression that a lot of anime especially at the time use for explosions just drives me nuts. I don't know, maybe I'm the only person that thinks of this. The characters are also adorable and likable, and while they're not the deepest, there are extra layers added to them to make them a bit more interesting. Despite being soldiers these layers are mostly interpersonal, having to do with their relationships with other strike witches, and there's never really punishments, or very little punishment, for stuff like disobeying orders, because this is meant to be a fun, relaxing anime, that does have light drama but nothing too extreme. My favorite character is the main character, Yoshika Miyafuji, and the added backstory with her father who is presumed dead, and is the reason she joined the military in the first place, does help. Oh, and there's lots of yuri bait in the series too as you could probably imagine considering that this is an anime with an almost entirely female cast from the 2000s, and it's great.",

He likes Sci fi, fantasy, military and historical shows.  \n\nSo far I’ve narrowed it down to Frieren (one of my favourites and fantasy), Jjk (it’s jjk. i think he’d get invested quite quickly maybe, but not as gripping or aligned) or maybe vinland saga, which i’ve not watched, but have heard is really good (please can you say if there is a lot of fanservice as well, to anyone who’s watched it). My all time favourite is code geass but i don’t think there’s any chance i’m getting through 3 kalen shower scenes and a table.\n\nSo please i’d love some help, also if you have any other ideas feel free to drop them below.

It's a woman with long purple hair if I'm not mistaken, but I don't think she's the main character.

    "content": "I'm surprised this anime got a season 2, considering that at the end of the first season it was stated that the squadron that the main girls of the series are apart of was being disbanded. I don't think there was ever any clear indication that this decision was reversed, and season 2 doesn't mention this at any time I'm pretty sure. But anyways I liked it just as much as the first season. It reminds me of anime like Azure Lane and Kantai Collection; the biggest difference is that in those anime the girls are meant to represent real life battleships, whereas they aren't in Strike Witches. You could also bring parallels between Strike Witches and other anime with girls battling in wars from the time like the underrated magical girl anime Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, although that series has a lot more drama. It's actually like if you combine Kancolle and Nanoha, the action and cute girls of both and the mostly lightheartedness of the former. By the way I'm aware that Strike Witches came before both, I just think the comparisons are kind of interesting. Other than that, just like before, the animation is better than it needed to be for this type of anime, the girls are adorable, and it's just good lighthearted fluff. It's easy to have fun with.",

    "content": "HI HI! I was hoping to get some help :0 \n\nI find it really hard to actually watch anime’s due to struggling to find ‘my kinda’ anime’s , I’m not too keen on the popular ones at the moments because of the edge and sadness.\n\nDon’t get me wrong , I love edge , just not in my series because I can’t take it , it makes me feel awful when I watch something sad or invest time into something just to get a disappointing end or unfulfilling end , kinda boring I know, but it destroys my mental health.\n\nI prefer when anime’s have been completed , so I can watch it all and not be left hanging , and not too slow paced as I struggle to keep my attention on something of it isn’t interesting, I know I sound picky but reallyyyy long anime’s don’t tend to be my thing , especially if they’re drawn out.\n\nWhen it comes to romance i hate when they don’t end up getting together, it ruins me. \n\nIm an extremely emotionally sensitive person, empathetic too , so it’s hard to find something to enjoy and relax watching, instead I’m left feeling all these emotions in already struggling with.\n\nThe kinda shows I’ve watched and enjoyed that can give the vibe of things that I like include :\n\n❀*̥˚ Totoro \n❀*̥˚ words bubble up like soda pop ❀*̥˚ Howels moving castle \n❀*̥˚ Arriety\n❀*̥˚ bubble \n❀*̥˚ ponyo \n❀*̥˚ Apothecaries diaries (i dislike how it isn’t completed yet as ‘cliffhangers’ give me anxiety)\n ❀*̥˚ Spirited away \n❀*̥˚ Horimiya (tho I’ve had to pause it as it hit too close to home for the time being)\n\n\nI’m starting to feel like finding something for me is hopeless, I really like slice of life, fantasy , romance , just fun upbeat anime’s , they can have emotion ofc , but I HATE when they aren’t resolved or we get a sad ending :((\n\nPeople usually always recommend Natuto, one piece, JJK, JoJo , I’ve started them but they’re not my think. JJK was close until I found out some things that would happen and for my sake I stepped back.\n\nI know I seem picky , but I hope you can help! &lt;3\n\nI’ve watched all the Ghibli movies ! \n",

I think this season has a great mix of comedy, slice-of-life, and fantasy stories, so it’s been fun to keep up with new episodes each week.

I think she was blonde and with ml she was supposed to solve mystery? or it was revange thing... either way it was heavily connected to this guy he either knew who they were looking for or was that guy... and he had black hair, I think? there was also some episode where they were in some kind of village doing something idk.. it mostly used dark and duller colours... the guy also was op and gave a vampire vibe I think... and that's all I remember but take it with a looot of salt cuz I'm pretty sure I mixed something up",
