    "content": "Currently on episode 38.\n\nI started the show because I was in the mood for xianxia, and because it seemed like a beloved show and a classic here on reddit.\n\nInitially, I really liked it, I enjoyed the world building, the characters etc, but somewhere in the story arch with SuSu in the heavenly palace, it became too much for me.\n\nOne of my biggest gripes with the show, is how many obsessed and cruel female characters with very little nuance there are, and they get so much screen time. The main leads also do not seem to have much character growth and I'm not that invested in the other couples either. In general, I've gotten to a point where it feels like things are happening, but none of the plot points seem to affect the characters' growth or relationships. It's really hard to root for anyone or any of the relationships at this point.\n\nIt's a shame abandoning it when I've already invested so many hours on it, so I need to know, is it worth finishing? Does it get better in the last 20 episodes? \n",

    "content": "# Sword and Beloved天地剑心- Episode Discussion - Episodes 8 &amp; 9\n\nWelcome to the episode discussions for Sword and Beloved! The long awaited 3rd entry into the Fox Spirit Matchmaker live action drama series is here, let's get into it!\n\n**This is the post for episodes 8 and 9 - please use spoiler tags for episodes or previews of episodes beyond these.**\n\n**Other Media Spoilers:** This show and discussions may contain spoilers for *Love in Pavilion* and *Red Moon Pact* due to the connected plot and world. If you are discussing a plot point from either drama that has *not yet been referenced in Sword and Beloved*, please use a spoiler tag. If you are familiar with the donghua, please use spoiler tags when referencing details that may be spoilers for this show and its characters.\n\n**Discussion Schedule:** My goal is to have these posts up around 12pm Pacific Time each day, give or take an hour, and to keep you updated if that changes.\n\n**Host Notes:**\n\nThank you all for joining us in the discussion! I've had such a great time reading everyone's comments. I appreciate that we have a mix of folks new to the franchise and those of us who have 1 or more of the previous. The newcomer questions about world and character details have been helpful for me even in sorting out all that I do or not remember clearly. If you spot me misremembering or misunderstanding something, please let me know! I take a collaborative view of these group watches and am definitely do not have all the answers.\n\nOkay, now on with show!\n\n\n\n***... Previously on Sword and Beloved...***\n\nI had this section in the inaugural post for a brief recap of 1-5 but I think Im keeping it in going forward as a place for reviewing past events or details both this show and the other two.\n\nYesterday we heard about the prophecy supposedly from legendary figure Aolai Sanshao. I can't remember if he is mentioned in Love in Pavilion, but in Red Moon Pact he is both discussed and then makes an actual appearance. \n\n[pic from Red Moon Pact](https://preview.redd.it/tjuohblyapxf1.jpg?width=774&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=243d393a6d4bb0d019a2d189d1dda5ee1a546e75)\n\n\n\n# Episode 8: The only impossible in this world is the one we place on ourselves\n\n**Key Events and Characters Moments:**\n\nThis was a dialog heavy ep and it was tricky to summarize it succinctly, but at least the subtitles seemed pretty good.\n\n\\-”Feelings make people weak,” says Madam Black Fox in a brief chat with one of her minions. She also reminds us she has a clone spy 'inside the circle' aka, in the realm where our heroes live.\n\n\\-Feng Tingyun is back to tell Qingtong to leave again, brandishing her sword at her. At first, Qingtong doesn't know she's been cured of the poison and Tingyun lets her believe she only has 3 days left to live. When Qingtong displays empathy toward her, saying 'you seem strict, but have a soft heart', Tingyun gets angrier, believing her to be a manipulative liar and reveals that she has been cured. Qingtong stands stunned as Tingyun storms away, once again threatening to tell her Hongye.\n\n\\-As Tingyun walks through Wangquan Manor  we hear her inner dialog that reminding us she does have nuance, she reflects on how lonely Fugui has always been and how much happier he has seemed lately with Qingtong around. After many threats to go to Hongye, we finally see Tingyun interact with him but the scene cuts away before we know what she will say to him...\n\n\\-*Big Feelings Bamboo Grove Part 1*:  Tingyun is waiting for Fugui in the grove, she asks him if he remembers how they met. Her village was destroyed by demons when she was 9 and he saved her, leading her to join Wangquan Manor and become  devoted to him. She asks the classic 'why her, not me' question and it becomes clear that what has been stressing her out about Qingtong is perhaps not just that she's a demon, but that she is another person who Fugui saved, rewarded with a closeness to Fugui that Tingyun has always wanted. Fugui is very respectful and compassionate through their whole convo.\n\n\\-Cut back to her meeting with Hongye and we see that what she talked to him about was her crush on Fugui, unlike how he responds to his sons feelings, Hongye is very respectful and kind about it to her, gently but firmly prompting her to let go.\n\n\\-Qingtong asks Fugui about why he gave her the antidote, learns that he has also been cured, and in inner dialog thinks about grateful she is to him.\n\n\\-Quan Jingting in the Sword Tomb is visited by a black fox with a scar through one eye, Jingting asks if Madam Black Fox can help him get the dragon spine sword he told us about last ep. This fox, I think Taisui? The same one he talked to before? Says that \"what Madam wants is for Wangquan Fugui to be reviled by the whole world.\" She wants *hatred*.\n\n\\-Hongye is disappointed Fugui didnt kill all the spider demons when he went to Silk Cave. Rumu stands up for his cousin.\n\n\\-*Big Feelings Bamboo Grove Part 2*: Fugui and his father go to the grove, Fugui asks “Why must you lecture me before mother's grave?” Hongye once again reminds him that his mother risked her life to give birth to him and states “Compassion only makes you weak” echoing the Black Fox's words from the opening of the ep. Fugui stands up for himself and his feelings and says:\n\n&gt;“But I haven't become weak. I used to believe killing demons was the right thing to do. But now, I feel it's meaningless to draw my sword for that. Lately, I have felt my heart growing warm and this warmth comes from bonds. The bonds with family, with friends, and even bonds with nature. Father, I have been growing stronger.”\n\nThese statements cause Hongye to sword fight his son. Their fight is intercut with flashbacks to their previous sword fight in the bamboo grove but this time Fugui knocks the Wangquan sword out of his father's hand it lands tip down in the earth between them. Fugui asks if he believes him that he has not become weak, but Hongye doesnt answer, walking away to leave his son standing alone in front of his mother's grave.\n\n[feelings are bad, says man using sword to express his feelings](https://preview.redd.it/hfs7a0eh2pxf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55c46fc517f34f1b6ca93568114f29b8baa8dac1)\n\n\\-Fugui contemplates his mother's grave, telling her he doesnt know why he is wielding his sword and wondering what would happen if he laid it down.\n\n\\-Rumu is at Fugui's house when he returns, Qingtong has left to make Fugui some dinner after waiting for him all day, Rumu inquires about their relationship. As Qingtong returns carrying soup, she overhears Fugui saying he hopes she will find her own path instead of circling him forever. He has his own responsibilities as the Soldier and “cannot lose himself in a romantic relationship” if this is an accurate translation of his words then I think this is the first confirmation we've had that he potentially *has* been having feelings for Qingtong (!!!!!!!!)\n\n\\-After overhearing their convo, we see Qingtong alone on a hill in the moonlight, reflecting on her dream of showing him the world and how she understands they have to be on different paths. I love when overheard convos lead to *more* understanding between characters and not less. Qingtong says she dreams of a world where humans and demons can live together as equals with love and respect.\n\n\\-Fugui turns his conversation with Rumu to his cousin's dragon crush, and we get more backstory here. Rumu explains that when his father was exiled to the Western Region he had a lot of conflicts with a clan of dragon demons and one kidnapped him. We see a flashback to Long Weiyun and child Rumu. Rumu explains to Fugui how his father didnt care if he lived or died and wanted to capture the dragon, so she took child Rumu and ran away. He explains how she took care of him, and used her magic to help him with his asthma. Rumu explains how he learned to fight, not from sword manuals, but by observing the natural world. He declines to tell Fugui the rest of the story, so we dont learn what caused the separation between him and Long Weiyoun.\n\n\\-Butler Fei has been on the trail of the medicine used to control Rumu at the convention, he tells Hongye he found out it was sold to Xiyun Hall (which is *not* a bakery as the ep 6 subtitles would have you believe😆) by a powerful demon, they dont know who it was but know they came from Peach Village in Dingling Mountain. Fei explains that they thought no one lived in the valley because it was surrounded by a miasma but scouts have discovered there is a village there where demons and humans live together. The village chief is Zhang Qi, The Black Sword, who Wangquan Hongye knows as the head of the Zhang family.\n\n\\-We get a scene in Peach Village, where Zhang Qi is peacefully strolling through leading a horse, waving to fellow villagers. The vibes here are very warm and peaceful. We meet a few demons, Jiu, a raccoon dog demon, and Qingli, a butterfly demon. Zhang Qi and Qingli are in love! Now we are getting into a hallmark feature of the other 2 shows, arcs in other locations about human-demon relationships. It seems Zhang Qi has been leading a double life as the head of Zhang family and as secret chief of this village.\n\n\\-Back to Fugui and Qingtong, she starts to tells him she overheard his convo with Rumu but is interrupted by Butler Fei coming in to see Fugui. Qingtong hides. Fei tells Fugui about the evil pill called Chakuwa and Peach Village. We get more reminders about the Zhang family here: Fei says that Zhang Qi is the son of Zhang Zheng, one of Hongye's sworn brothers who died in the battle outside the circle in *Love in Pavilion*. \n\n\\-Qingtong comes out of hiding and says she plans to go find her brother at some point, Fugui invites her to join his mission to Peach Village first.\n\n\\-Qingtong made some clothes for Feng Tingyun and tries to bring them to her, but Tingyun refuses to trust her and tells her to leave. Qingtong tells Tingyun she is planning on leaving and not to worry anymore\n\n\\-Back in the Sword Tomb, Quan Jingting talks again about how he needs to find the dragon spine sword, his attendant gives him a pep talk... only to be killed by Jingting's spooky hand with the dragon scale power, his blood seeps out onto grooves in the floor, unlocking a mechanism which releases the sword. Jingting says “a true dragon craves blood” which I guess explains it? I was wondering why the Wangquan ancestors who locked the sword up had made a blood ritual powered lock, ensuring only their most evil descendants would be able to access it....\n\n\\-Black fox Taisui returns to ask Jingting if he is truly ready for the power of the sword, it will be painful to absorb its power into his body and in the end he will become half human and half demon. He vows he is ready for it, he needs to vanquish his enemies.\n\n\\-We end on Fugui walking toward his palanquin, ready to go to Peach Village.\n\n**Thoughts and Notes:**\n\n\\-I *love* Qingtong's light purple outfit. Obviously she looked very cute in her original pink but since the rest of the spiders are in darker hued fits, this works to both include her in that *and* set her apart from the other spiders at the same time since its a lighter purple.\n\n\\-Fugui always in light colors really reminds me of his mother, especially when he is in the bamboo grove. At this point I think I have just accepted I am going to be sad about Dongfang Huaizhu for the entirely of this show. Did I mention I have been watching A Journey to Love recently? Don't worry I have paused it to focus on this show and to space out all my Liu Shishi character related sadness (its my first time watching AJTL but I have been warned its 😭)\n\n[Hongye has raised his son not to back down and now that might be backfiring on him](https://preview.redd.it/okhkng4i9pxf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e15cb1f34f55fcd12df037579e0e4f3ecf13f4c3)\n\n  \n\n\n# Episode 9: I wish I could stay in this dream forever\n\n**Key Events and Character Moments:**\n\n\\-Fugui has arrived at Peach Village with CGI Qingtong riding on his shoulder, they both seem pleasantly surprised by what they see. Qingtong is our tour guide, describing all the scenes they are passing by of humans and demons co-existing. Its her dream described in last episode come true. They meet Jiu and her duckling named...Fugui! 🐤 Qingtong resumes her human form.\n\n\\-As Jiu leads them to Zhang Qi's residence, the shot fades them out as they walk away, bringing focus and eerie music to a patch of dark red flowers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v1q364k7bpxf1.jpg?width=774&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f2903f91283179fb508b7d9ee2aecd7d9ba4c57\n\n\\-Zhang Qi isn't home so Jiu asks Fugui and Qingtong to sit and wait, she makes them tea, secretly adding in something to knock them out. Fugui seems skeptical when offered the tea, Qingtong smells it and notices something is off. They pretend to drink the tea. Jiu tries to steal Fugui's sword but Qingtong has been waiting for him and chases her into a bamboo grove. Fugui arrives and Jiu leaves them stranded in the bamboo grove where some of the poisonous miasma still lurks. Fugui puts up a magical barrier to keep the fog out overnight.\n\n\\-*Fog Trip*: this is apparently psychedelic miasma! Qingtong is hallucinating and spinning around with glee, Fugui is concerned. Qingtong is being real cute but Fugui wants her to use her power to detox from the fog. She starts speaking to a hallucination of duckling-Fugui and this allows human Fugui to hear all her inner thoughts about him and how sad she is on his behalf, she is worried about what his life will be life if she leaves him.\n\n\\-Back at the village, the mysterious flowers is spreading an ominous influence.\n\n\\-In the morning, Qingtong is worried she was talking nonsense during her fog trip, but Fugui tells her she was just asleep. Fugui says they should leave and when Qingtong gets up to follow, she just leaves the fire she had been trying to start still smoking. As someone who lives in a wildfire area, even fictional untended fires really stress me out 😆\n\n\\-On their way back they run into Jiu who tells them she tricked them because she recognized Fugui's sword from the Yiqi Alliance is scared of the stories she has heard about the Soldier ruthlessly killing demons. Qingtong thinks she recognizes Jiu from somewhere and when they return to the villages, decides to follow her.\n\n\\-Qingtong confronts Jiu, saying she know she's a 900 year old demon who sometimes steals intelligence from the Silk Cave operations.\n\n\\-Fugui meets Zhang Qi, who recognizes him as the Soldier. Their conversation is restrained, but the music is TENSE. Fugui says he needs to take him back to Yiqi alliance at Hongye's request but they can duel for it. They have a mental sword fight, and Zhang Qi concedes. Fugui asks him about the Chakuwa drug and Zhang Qi says he has never heard of it but will look into it.\n\n\\-Qingtong comes in with scrolls of intel she took from Jiu, who has been acting as information broker.\n\n\\-Qingtong and Fugui find out Zhang Qi is married to the butterfly demon Qingli, then they overhear a few friendly exchanges with villagers. Qingtong reflects in inner dialog on how much she likes here and its just like her dream.\n\n\\-Based on Fugui's reading of the intel scrolls, Qingtong goes out to do some sleuthing in the village, keeping an eye on a few particular villagers of suspicious backgrounds. They meet a green demon Fugui had encountered before whose lands had been taken over by Yiqi alliance, causing his clan to become homeless. They determine the green demon is not who they are looking for.\n\n\\-Their next suspect is a a human-demon pair playing flutes in a bamboo grove, Fugui guesses their real identities but determines that they are innocent as well, the music they are playing comes from the heart and is true.\n\n\\-Back in the village, Fugui notices that there is something amiss with the dark red flowers (and I'm suddenly having a flashback of my own, I think we've seen these flowers in one of the other shows as well?). As Fugui walks by, we move to a deer demon bringing flower seeds he has collected to another villager.\n\n\\-Fugui and Qingtong return to Zhang Qi's and get to meet Qingli. Zhang Qi tells them the story of how he founded Peach Village, met Qingli and fell in love.\n\n\\-Fugui asks Qingli if she knows what kind of flowers the dark red ones are and she tells him they are Phoenix Flowers, grown from seeds gathered by Little Deer who just so happens to be Lu Shu the Deer Demon that is Fugui and Qingtong's final suspect to investigate. Fugui and Qingtong share their suspicions with Zhang Qi who says he will have people track down Lu Shu.\n\n**Thoughts and Notes:**\n\n\\-I'm glad we are getting into a new arc and get to see another part of this world, its one of my favorite aspects of these shows!\n\n[sleepy spider](https://preview.redd.it/yxznhetbbpxf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b2e2710a1f3b9f072088c2aa1447946864c753f)\n\n  \n\n\n**Questions and Speculations:**\n\n\\-Sometimes I enjoy guessing what will happen in a show, but I dont love it when I jump to a bummer conclusion. Generalized spoiler for the other shows and guess about potential future event: &gt;!I feel like the side arc human-demon couples always come to a tragic end so I'm worried about Zhang Qi and Qingli 😥!&lt;\n\n\\-Zhang Qi  question: Apparently I do not remember the details of the Zhang family because I was  surprised to learn Zhang Zeng had a son, can someone please remind me? Or is he not his actual son and just the successor to being head of Zhang family?  I remember some of the&gt;!identity swap part of Ding Yuxi's!&lt;story but that is it I guess.

The mix of boyish innocence, integrity, honor and then fighting skills surpassing most grown men. It was enchanting. 22 yr old actor, Ao Ziyi, did a phenomenal job with conveying this young character...not to mention the fight scenes, he killed those...so believable and engaging.

Like a glass of beer stored for a long time, brewing complex emotions and the mystery of the death of a woman named Liu Xue Mei. The brewery was once the pride of the city, but after many years of decline, it became the stage for many murders. Liu Xue Mei's life and death are closely entangled in a conspiracy driven by ambition and greed.\n\nEveryone is like a pawn, ruthlessly manipulated and sacrificed. The truth is always hidden in the most inconspicuous way. A ghost that has been lurking for many years is planning a bloody revenge. Her anger and despair turned into the shadow of a serial murder case, covering Songjiang. The reincarnation of fate finally ended in a sudden and seemingly fateful accident.\n\nJournalist Shen Yue Shui revisits the abandoned Songjiang Brewery, uncovering dark secrets of ambition, betrayal, and tragedy. As a shadow of vengeance looms, she captures the human struggles buried in the brewery’s haunting past.\n\n(Source: Chinese = Baidu || Translation = MyDramaList)\n\n[Baidu Baike](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%86%89%E6%A2%A6/64916153) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37042229/) \n\n\n***\n\n**Note:**\n\nToday is Tencent's investment conference day, October 27, 2025.\n\nEach of the four major domestic streaming platforms holds similar events a few times a year to showcase their upcoming dramas.

    "content": "Recently, I’ve felt a sense of loss while watching *historical* C-dramas. It seems like most recent ones have lost unique plots and, more importantly, have lost the ability to tell the story of two people, not just one couple. Nowadays, it feels like I’m watching the love story of a couple rather than the story of two people who fall in love.\nBoth leads no longer have plot lines that can stand on their own.\n\nFor example, referencing **Story of Minglan**, which is one of my favorite dramas. Even if Minglan never married, I could still say that she had a story. *Very mild spoiler*. &gt;!She got revenge for her mother, learned to navigate the dangerous power struggles of her household, and tried her best to survive with dignity and intelligence.!&lt; She had her own arc, one that could connect you to her even without ever seeing her interact with the male lead.\n\nBut now, in many recent dramas, if you remove the male lead or female lead, the entire plot collapses. Their motivations, struggles, and growth exist only to serve the romance. It’s as if the characters don’t exist beyond each other.\n\nI miss when dramas allowed both leads to live within the story world, to have their own dreams, friends, and conflicts that just happened to intertwine romantically. Another example of this is **A dream of splendor**, where even though their plots aligned after, the female lead had a role that was just hers in trying to make her tea shop work.\n\nAnother good modern example is **Flourished peony**, which even though the male and female lead were involved from the beginning, they still had separate roles that coincided sometimes with her building her flower shop and him working for the palace. These are times when the romance added to who they were rather than defined them.\n\nI’m not saying modern C-dramas are bad, actually some are still entertaining, but I do miss that feeling of watching two complete people slowly collide and grow together instead of watching a single storyline dressed up as a relationship.",

[Hunting] down the murderer was supposed to be a trivial thing, but it cost innocent lives. Jiang Lian, who was lying in ambush on the baiting scene, seemed to be related to the matter of the walking corpses. For what cause is he going through such troubles?\n\nIt is said that \"mountains and rivers do not cross\", and the visit of water ghosts is already a strange thing. Why did Meng Qian Zi personally visit this old forest in the remote mountain? The mountain ghost has always valued peace, but the trip to the Western Hunan encountered plenty of misfortunes.

    "content": "Ok, back at it again. I finally figured out some formatting so I'm slowly getting the hang of it!  We got a bit to talk about so let's jump right in.\n\n**Previous discussion links:**\n\n[Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1oewmze/whispers_of_fate_%E6%B0%B4%E9%BE%99%E5%90%9F_2025_what_are_your_first/) I [Episodes 1-5](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1ognprh/whispers_of_fate_episodes_15_discussion/)\n\n\\-------\n\n# Episode 6\n\nWhile episodes 4 and 5 felt like the conclusion of an arc and a small rest stop, episode 6 revs the pace again with necessary background information. The mood of this episode feels serious as we explore the weight of past events and how it shapes the goals of many of our characters.\n\n[Master Shao really cares about Chunji](https://preview.redd.it/4nrmshyrtjxf1.jpg?width=2387&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63cbdcf6ba733b422e7ee50f0513b39e286a68e6)\n\nWe start the ep with Zhong Chunji feeling dejected after making her report. The rain backdrop sets the perfect mood for painful childhood memories to resurface. Luckily, she doesn't have a chance to dwell on the past too long because her master, Shao Yanping, comes not only to cheer her up, but task her with the investigation of Yu Qifeng. Unlike the other elders, he seems to take her report seriously. Chunji then sets off with an alliance member towards Sword King City under the guise of Yu Qifeng's Sword Duel Festival.\n\nWith Chunji on her way, Master Shao takes an opportunity to visit Master Puzhu and consult with him about the blood poison pills and Chunji's findings. Their musings are as follows:\n\n* Yanxian city is an important imperial transport route and Yanmen sect is crucial for skyward transportation, therefore, the poison pills appearing in these two places seem to be about distribution.\n* If distribution of the pills is necessary, someone behind the scenes is trying to control the route.\n* Yu Qifeng is suspect number one because he has power, influence, and means to control the movement.\n* The only person who can go against him is Tang Lici but he's mysterious and untrustworthy. While he's not considered out-right evil, they don't think he's good.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vpktzeegujxf1.jpg?width=2195&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07e5a6db786d2a6847ba523648c831268ec54e6d\n\nMaster Puzhu concludes that everything can't be left to Tang Lici and that he must investigate on his own. He plans to travel to Sword King City.\n\nElsewhere, Tang Lici, Chi Yun, and Miss Shei are traveling by boat to the same destination. Assassin Shen Langhuan is now part of the team ~~and couldn't be any more grumpy about it.~~  TL is rather happy though because Shen's Shadow Concealment Technique is incredibly useful. That said, Shen is not willing to help unless TL can grant him 2 wishes. The first wish involves gathering special jade pearls used in the seven-treasure jade hairpin and 2. allowing him to kill the heir/owner of the Rebirth Scroll technique.\n\nCurious about how Shen intends to kill the person owning the Rebirth Scroll technique,  TL asks Shen to perform the technique on him. A few things then happen:\n\n* Shen agrees and TL is locked in a mental realm meant to trap him with his inner demons. We get more background on TL's time at Zhoudi Tower. It turns out Master Fang named him Tang Lici while his real name is Ajibanr Tang Jia. TL  at that time seems to have lost some aspect of his memory.\n\n[I love every flashback of Zhoudi Tower at this point. ](https://preview.redd.it/6197t69xujxf1.jpg?width=2387&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=603c4ce375d8c32c922552bb9ff04809ba0cf412)\n\n* Shen's technique allows him to view what TL is witnessing in the mental realm and we learn that Shen has a deep grudge related to Liu Yan but takes it out on TL.\n* TL uno reverses and mimic's Shen's technique trapping Shen instead.\n* Now TL is the one witnessing Shen's mental p.o.v and sees that Shen had a chance encounter with Liu Yan sometime after the fall of Zhoudi tower. LY at that time injures Shen and makes him lose his life-extending pill. He's also the one to leave the scar on his cheek.\n* TL stops the technique recognizing that Shen was an innocent person harmed by the feud between him and LY.\n\nShen eventually regains consciousness and is ready to open up about why his second wish is important to him. It's another tragic story where that one random encounter with LY stopped Shen from delivering the life-extending pill to his terminally ill lover who then died. He's been set on revenge ever since.\n\n[The assassin, the outlaw, and the monster are now properly working together. My shaylasss](https://preview.redd.it/rlqcwhjovjxf1.jpg?width=2371&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4c9729510d198aed132629a91818d8d8c48a177)\n\nTL confesses that he is the rightful owner of the Rebirth Scroll but it was taken from him when he was injured by LY and is now his sworn enemy. Chiyun joins the conversation worried about TL. They resolve to work together and a bond is formed through the shared a jar of wine. Now all that's left is to reach Sword King City.\n\n# Episode 7\n\nThe stage is set and many character paths are set to merge now that the immediate goals of several characters have been established.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oa8qxzz88kxf1.jpg?width=2387&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c301f4da31f3583a1ba4f095cdceacf6e783dd\n\nTang Lici and company finally arrive in Sword King City and just miss the Sword Opening. Per the rules of the city, an invitation is now necessary to enter. Our master strategist, TL, has thoroughly planned everything and intended to gain entry through his second, more powerful identity as Master of Wanqiao Chamber.\n\nWhat's more, he's also the foster son of the imperial father-in-law and practically royalty. Of course the 'show-boating' and commotion ends up being intentional. TL wants to gain attention from Sword King Yu and anyone else hiding in the shadows.\n\nMeanwhile in the city, Yu Qifeng's Sword Duel festival is in full swing with \"friendly\" duels in session. There's a sizable crowd gathered with Chunji already in attendance. Many attendees are said to go there to witness the Yu family's Sword Phoenix technique that only Sword King Yu has mastered. However, we can see though Chunji's perception that his martial arts is a bit off.\n\n[Xue Xianzi's grand entrance](https://preview.redd.it/r0ta2mg7nkxf1.jpg?width=2387&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d5e6a5c712dc693d245b09295bb0784f25f54a2)\n\nThings heat up (or rather cools down) when a new challenger, Xue Xianzi, arrives putting on a rather obviously fake show of his duel with elder Yu. Just as quickly as he arrives, he leaves. It seems nonsensical but this later turns out to be another piece of TL's plan.\n\nWhile elder Yu is pre occupied with the festival, TL and Shen decide to make their move. They go to the city's Tianyan Sword Wall which lore tells us is famous for holding Sword Essence left by one of the 7 martial art masters who fought against Yique Yinyang. TL enters this wall and masters the Sword Phoenix technique. His Sword Phoenix makes a grand entrance over the festival to lure elder Yu and the festival attendees to Tianyan Wall. Through crowd pressure instigated by Chunji, elder Yu is ultimately coaxed into asserting his authority as sword king and holding a public trial for Jiang Qingyu of the Yanmen sect.\n\n[I can just imagine him thinking: \\\\\"I'm screwed.\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/1xtjvkn1skxf1.jpg?width=2387&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d5830e1197dfb84373685b76a95c88dda792512)\n\nBy the end of the day elder Yu is feeling the pressure. Jiang Qingyu was already secretly killed by him and he's not sure how to deal with TL's second identity. Elder Yu meets with a member of Fengliu Shop about the trap he fell into because of TL's hidden agenda.\n\nBut let's not rejoice yet, elder Yu is not going down without a fight. With the help of Fengliu Shop he returns the favor by setting a trap for Shen by framing him for JQ's death in the presence of Master Puzhu who has only just arrived after meeting with a friend.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz7m2du9tkxf1.jpg?width=2387&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ff05dc2628f8fbfa823451e888b6c095b3449d1\n\nWe end with what seems to be a confrontation between Master Puzhu and TL. I would be worried but our master strategist TL always has a plan. \n\n# All right, that's all I got!\n\n**What were your thoughts?**",

Li Qiu Ping and Zheng De Cheng, two cadres with outstanding abilities and personalities, adhered to the concept of \"the people's city is built by the people\", and with the help of the reform and opening-up policy and the Central Document No. 1, they found a way to reform and led thousands of farmers to build a modern city on the tidal flats through the \"fund-raising and partnership\" initiative without using a penny from the state.\n\nThis is a miracle of city building from scratch, and it is also a feat in the history of city building in China. The fate of hundreds of thousands of farmers has been changed. Li Qiu Ping, Zheng De Cheng, Jie Chun Lai, Gao Xue Mei and other city builders dared to think, act and be the first, and wrote a magnificent chapter in the sunny 1980s.\n\n(Source: Chinese = Tencent || Translation = MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"Zhong Guo Nong Min Cheng\" (中国农民城) by Zhu Xiao Jun (朱晓军). \n\n[Baidu Baike](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%80%A0%E5%9F%8E%E8%80%85/62093485) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/36126294/)\n\n\n\n***\n\n**Note:**\n\nToday is Tencent's investment conference day, October 27, 2025.\n\nEach of the four major domestic streaming platforms holds similar events a few times a year to showcase their upcoming dramas.

There are 3 families who guard the three rivers that have \"water ghosts\" in their family. \"Water ghosts\" are excellent at swimming and diving.\n\nThe families make a living by hiding the treasures of wealthy families in the water during times of war/strife and they take a cut. The water ghosts ask their ancestors to come into their body, enter into a trance and dive into the water to hide this treasure. Afterwards, the location of the treasure is forgotten until it is time to retrieve it, and the time in between can span generations. \n\n&gt;!Unfortunately, the families started not being able to locate the treasures. Their ancestors had foreseen this and left a clue to fix this problem which led to the families going to the source of the three rivers, Kunlun Mountains. Yi Sa's entire family is killed except her (at 3 years old). Yi Sa grows up and meets Zong Hang (who became a water ghost by accidental transformation and is not part of the 3 families). Together, they try to figure out what happened.

    "title": "Sword and Beloved 天地剑心 - Episode Discussion - Episodes 6 &amp; 7",
    "content": "# Sword and Beloved 天地剑心 - Episode Discussion - Episodes 6 &amp; 7\n\nWelcome to the episode discussions for Sword and Beloved! The long awaited 3rd entry into the Fox Spirit Matchmaker live action drama series is here, let's get into it!\n\n**This is the post for episodes 6 and 7 - please use spoiler tags for episodes or previews of episodes beyond these.**\n\n**Other Media Spoilers:** This show and discussions may contain spoilers for *Love in Pavilion* and *Red Moon Pact* due to the connected plot and world. If you are discussing a plot point from either drama that has *not yet been referenced in Sword and Beloved*, please use a spoiler tag. If you are familiar with the donghua, please use spoiler tags when referencing details that may be spoilers for this show and its characters. \n\n**Discussion Schedule:** My goal is to have these posts up around 12pm Pacific Time, give or take an hour, each day and to keep you updated if that changes.\n\n**Some facts about your host:**\n\nThis is my first time hosting! I think my style for these posts will be somewhere between full recap and just highlighting the major events of each ep, it will likely evolve as the days go on. Thank you for your patience as I figure it all out. Also, I normally reddit from my phone using markdown for formatting, but I'm typing this up on my computer and using the rich text editor...if you notice something weird with the formatting or have any suggestions for ease of reading, please let me know.\n\nI have watched the preceding shows *Love in Pavilion* and *Red Moon Pact* but have not watched the donghua. \n\nI decided to dive into these shows earlier this year when I watched two Cheng Yi dramas back to back (*Mysterious Lotus Casebook, Love and Redemption*) and then read this post by u/AquaphobicTurtle  [What is Fox Spirit Matchmaker: What is it? Should you watch it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1kmd1t3/fox_spirit_matchmaker_what_is_it_should_you_watch/) One thing I enjoy across all media is long form storytelling, where plots unfold for many years/decades/generations so I was super curious about these shows and their interconnected stories. \n\nA few eps into *Love in Pavilion* and I became a) deeply smitten with Liu Shishi as Dongfang Huaizhu and b) very intrigued and invested in the world building of the show. I moved onto Red Moon Pact with tempered expectations, the general consensus here seemed to be that it was not very good, but ended up really enjoying it as well. I did think the pacing was a bit uneven but I found myself once again drawn into the world and its details.\n\nI wasn't familiar with Li Yitong when I first heard about this show but then got to know her acting this summer watching *A Dream Within A Dream* (and her small but mighty part in *Love Between Fairy and Devil*) and after that my excitement for this show doubled. I'm not sure if the CGI spider version of her would have worked for me if I wasn't already familiar with her face and acting, but I found myself more charmed by tiny CGI Yitong than I would have expected.\n\nSo on that thought, on with the show!\n\n\n\n***... Previously on Sword and Beloved ...***\n\nIn this world, humans and demons have been at odds for many generations. \n\n**Cheng Yi** plays **Wangquan Fugui**, the inheritor of two powerful human bloodlines raised to be the ultimate warrior in the fight against demons. He has very cool fight moves! He is very lonely!\n\n**Li Yitong** plays **Qingtong**, a little spider demon just out here trying to survive. She has cool spider powers! She is also lonely!\n\nWangquan Fugui's dad has, like many of us, never gotten over the events of *Love in Pavilion*. He has had 20 years to try and be human to his son but instead has been cold, distant, and domineering. This has not worked out great for either of them. It makes me sad if I think about it too much.\n\n**Wangquan Hongye** has competition for Worst Father of the Show in the form of his cousin **Quan Jingting** who thinks he has raised his son to be the ultimate rival for Wangquan Fugui (for me currently Jingting is winning the Worst Dad prize). Jokes on both dads as we find out Fugui and his cousin **Quan Rumu** have been friends their whole lives! \n\nQuan Jingting had a scheme to kill Wangquan Hongye at The Blue Sky Convention, a tournament of the Yiqi Alliance (the allied human clans lead by Wangquan Manor) but it was foiled by the boys and he framed his and Hongye's uncle **Wangquan Shouyi** for it. Hongye doesn't seem to believe he is entirely innocent though and sentenced him to be locked up, guarding The Sword Tomb.\n\nWangquan Fugui helped Qingtong gain human form, sacrificing 10 years worth of his life to do so, and to find a name for herself (spiders are so numerous they are literally only numbered where she comes from). Could these meaningful gifts be the foundation for something deeper between them....is Qingtong already looking a little heart eyed at our boy? Stay tuned to find out!\n\n# Episode 6: Wounded by emotion, unstoppable for love\n\n**Key Events and Characters Moments:**\n\n\\-Fugui stands up for Rumu, informing his father that Rumu was manipulated into his part of the deadly events at the tournament, but his dad wants him only to be the Soldier and not interfer in Yiqi Alliance affairs. Later in the ep, Hongye does pardon Rumu in front of the other Yiqi Alliance members.\n\n\\-His dad has been very focused each ep on Fugui's lack of mastery over The Heaven-and-Earth Strike, which is a special skill only available to members of the Wangquan family. Another lineage Fugui carries is the Dongfang Spiritual Blood from his mother, a big part of the previous 2 shows. The Dongfang Spiritual Fire is a special skill tied to their bloodline that produces a flame that is especially dangerous to demons.\n\n\\-*Rumu and the Dragon*: Rumu wears a beautifully beaded outfit to to meet with the dragon demon Long Weiyun but he falls asleep before she gets there and when she does she doesn't wake him, referencing some past event between them that remains unresolved. She seems to be the same demon we saw kidnap him as a child in a previous flashback that revealed just how terrible his dad was. Upon waking, Rumu is devastated to realize he missed her arrival.\n\n\\-A magical stone that was supposed to play a role in the interrupted tournament is brought before the Yiqi Alliance, it explodes into swirling images of the Heaven-Earth strike shattering a barrier and releasing 'the world-shattering beasts beyond the bound.' The images are determined to be a prophecy left by the legendary figure Aolai Sanshao. \n\n\\-*Spooky fox sighting*: after the prophecy is revealed we get a brief scene of the realm inhabited by the black foxes and an eerie smokey humanoid figure addressed as 'Madam.' Madam demands her foxes bring her Wangquan Fugui at all costs.\n\n\\-We get a brief flashback to the what I'm calling Big Feelings Bamboo Grove, where all Wangquan father- son emotional moments seem to happen. If the show wants *Love in Pavilion* watchers to think about Dongfang Huaizhu every time we see this bamboo grove, they are succeeding, I miss her so much.\n\n\\-Qingtong has been keeping busy learning to cook human food. Later, she receives a butterfly message from the lead spider demon, Madam Yin, threatening her brother and giving her something 'to take out Wangquan Fugui' in a small container. Later she contemplates putting it in Fugui's tea and we see her serve tea to him in Big Feelings Bamboo Grove (is it the same grove? are there multiple? does it travel through space and time?)\n\n\\-Hongye continues to refuse to let Fugui experience the outside world, they have a sad discussion about it on a big boat on the way back to Fugui's Cold Pool (?) (I remain confused about the geography of Wangquan Manor)\n\n\\-Fugui and Butler Fei discuss an evil medicine, which I think is the pill that Rumu was forced to take (the subtitles start to really fall apart here)\n\n\\-Qingtong receives another threat via butterfly and reluctantly tampers with some incense and after a few tense moments, lights it, tearing up as she does (pic below)\n\n\\-Previously Feng Tingyun had picked up Qingtong's captured brown spider demon and now has him trapped in a cage for interrogation\n\n**Thoughts and Notes:**\n\nAolai Sanshao was one of my favorite characters in *Red Moon Pact*, every time we hear him referenced I cheer a little bit, that's my boy!\n\nI find this idea of a prophecy super interesting, and its echoing part of *Love in Pavilion*&gt;!where the main characters are shown their fate in an future timeline.!&lt;\n\nThe subtitles for this ep got a little chaotic and then just straight up messy by the end. Yikes iQIYI! \n\n[regret and resolve](https://preview.redd.it/5jxldxzzvhxf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7850f7dcf770c3db13656f74141746019faccee5)\n\n# Episode 7: Only when one's heart is free of dust can they see clearly\n\n**Key Events and Character Moments:**\n\n\\-Qingtong has cute new purple outfit, she's in the woods and we see her swallow the poison Madam Yin had given her for Fugui. She then goes back to Silk Cave to report her successful mission. She tells Madam Yin that she was poisoned to by being forced to share food and drink with Fugui and begs for the antidote. Now that someone has poisoned themselves for the sake of someone they care about, we know for sure we are watching a cdrama.\n\n\\-Feng Tingyun arrives at Fugui's house and discerns that he has been poisoned with a Gu poison\n\n\\-*Villain Monologue Time Part 1*: Back in the Silk Cave, Madam Yin is mourning another spider demon revealed to have been vanquished by Wangquan Hongye (I think this takes place in the first couple eps of Love in Pavillion if you want more spidey details). Madam Yin says she wants Wangquan Hongye to 'taste the pain of losing your loved ones'... someone needs to recap her on the story of his life so far! Later in her confrontation with Fugui we learn the aforementioned deceased spider demon was her husband, or maybe that was obvious before but I missed it.\n\n\\-*Villain Monologue Time Part 2*: We see Quan Jingting in his punishment seclusion, he is visited by an attendant and uses the opportunity to reminisce about some backstory, offering up this summary of his character: \"I was born in troubled times. I want to be the one holding the knife, not the meat on the chopping block.\" He describes a betrayal and nearly dying from 'the dragon demon's trap.' In his darkest moment of despair, he was visited by the black fox Taisui who taunts him and lures him in with promises of a gift from The Black Fox Madam, the 'True Dragon Power.' He reveals he has a spooky hand possessed by the 'reverse dragon scale' which seems not be the power he is after. Luckily there is a legend that the Wangquan ancestors once killed a true dragon and forged a sword from its spine and its located in...guess where?! The Sword Tomb he has been banished to! This dude has schemes within schemes within schemes. \n\n\\-Fugui has some Hongye being a bad dad flashbacks while trying to remove the Seven Bitterness poison from himself with his spiritual power. He contemplates his interactions with Qingtong and rightfully concludes she was threatened into poisoning him. What, no miscommunication and assumption of ill intent?? Will this drama heal the scars *Love and Redemption* left on me??\n\n\\-Fugui travels in his windowless palanquin once again, but this time Qingtong has left him a gift in the form of a glittering web of stars, a light for the darkness that usually surrounds him\n\n\\-Qingtong is reunited with her brother and gives him the name Qingcheng and half of the spiritual power given to her by Fugui so he can take human form. Then off screen the two of them run away.\n\n\\-Fugui has traveled to Mt Baiwu where Silk Cave is located, Madam Yin confronts him (pic below). He is pleased to learn Qingtong and her brother have escaped. Madam Yin is displeased to learn he can still has cool sword moves despite being poisoned. She is even more displeased to realize he has powers of the Dongfang Spiritual Blood.\n\n\\-Qingtong tries to bring the antidote to Fugui but is stopped by Feng Tingyun who we learn has a bit of a mean streak. Despite being poisoned and not doing great, Qingtong gets to use some of her cool spider silk fighting skills in their face off. She makes it back to Fugui's house but Tingyun catches up with her, I was so nervous during these scenes! Felt like the first time either of our leads has been in real danger so far.\n\n\\-*Rescue!* Fugui arrives just in time to stop Tingyun really harming Qingtong. Tingyun storms off threatening to report the situation to Wangquan Hongye. I never get tired of characters swooping in at the last minute to save each other, works on me every time.\n\n\\-Fugui and Qingtong have a quiet conversation about why she poisoned him and didn't tell him about it. He agrees to take the antidote with a gentle smile on his face, she faints from relief/exhaustion/poison. He secretly feeds her the antidote instead. There was such a big swell of romantic music here I almost thought we were going to get a posion-curing-sharing-the-antidote-via-kiss moment but I guess we are too early in the show for that. \n\n\\-Fugui has asked Rumu to come to help him expel the poison from his body via spiritual force. Rumu is still in his beautiful outfit from his attempted date with the dragon. \n\n\\-We end with some ominous Black Fox Madam scheming and Quan Jingting slowly ascending the stairs of the Sword Tomb\n\n**Thoughts and Notes:**\n\nJust noticed in this ep that Madam Yin is sitting on a throne with a carved spider design, love a commitment to an aesthetic. There is also a giant spider web shaped rug? Amazing. The details in all the costumes and demon designs in this show are really fun. \n\nMy brain is convinced that 'pavilion' is spelled with two Ls so if you see that typo, please disregard lol\n\n[I loved this shot, this show is gorgeous](https://preview.redd.it/n2gootq2whxf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec5b498d44b084ff8e4aaa3f6130973514decf99)\n\n\n\n**Questions and Speculations:**\n\nDid anyone else notice Quan Rumu often wears a *black fox* pelt? Purely aesthetic coincidence or... something else?\n\nI don't speak Mandarin and am watching with the English iQIYI subs. For any Mandarin speakers in the thread, I'm curious about Fugui's title of 'Soldier' and the way Qingtong has been addressing him 'Young Master Fugui', what are the terms they are using that are being translated as such? If anyone has further language insights they feel like sharing or comments on the subtitles, I really welcome them. I am always curious about translation successes and failures and personally just like knowing the original place names, character titles, nicknames etc... \n\n  \nThank you for reading and joining in the discussion, can't wait to chat with you all!\n\n\n\n**Links to Discussion Posts:**\n\n[Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1ofjozl/sword_and_beloved_%E5%A4%A9%E5%9C%B0%E5%89%91%E5%BF%83_2025_what_are_your_first/) | \n\n\n\n**Other useful links:** [DramaWiki page for the show](https://wiki.d-addicts.com/Sword_and_Beloved) | [OST info](https://wiki.d-addicts.com/Sword_and_Beloved_OST)| [MyDramaList page for the show](https://mydramalist.com/60463-fox-spirit-matchmaker/cast)\n\n",

    "content": "Hey everyone, I’ll be hosting a few discussions for WoF! It’s my first time and I’m still figuring out some formatting quirks while using an ipad.  This  will be a bit text heavy this first go around until I figure some stuff out. Thanks for your patience!!!\n\n### Previous discussion links: \n\n[Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1oewmze/whispers_of_fate_%E6%B0%B4%E9%BE%99%E5%90%9F_2025_what_are_your_first/)\n\n—-\n\n## Episodes 1-3 \n\n\nWhispers of Fate opens up with Luo Yunxi making a dramatic first appearance on a flying palanquin while looking *deliciously* sinister. The aesthetics 100% foreshadow his future actions because not long after, his character arrives at a wedding celebration hosted at the Hao family residence in the city of Yanxian and massacres almost everyone with the most eloquent strum of his pipa. \n\n                                                                    \nTurns out, this act of brutality is not a stand alone event but one of many events occurring recently where a mysterious “black-clad” man has been wreaking havoc across the land killing people with his Pipa. What’s strange is that the technique used, “the Sound Killing Technique”, should’ve been a lost art after a tragic ambush that killed master Fang and many practitioners of this martial art 4 years prior. Rumors say this mystery man could be one of the missing disciples who vanished.\n\n\n#### Zhou Chunji and Miss Shei team up with Chi Yun and Tang Lici \n\n\n* The wedding massacre sparks an investigation headed by Master Shao Yanping of the Central Plains Sword Alliance who dispatches his disciple, Zhou Chunji, to lead the ground work in collaboration with other Sword Alliance sects.\n* By the time Zhou Chunji arrives, the bride of the wedding (Miss Shei) is found alive, imprisoned and presumably tortured by the city lord (also member of the sword alliance), Yang Shangqing \n* A report leads them all to Jinye temple.\n* At Jinye temple they are confronted by Chi Yun, a guest of the temple and traveling companion to Tang Lici (our ethereal ML).\n* Turns out the main villain is an imposter using TL’s likeness in an act of revenge.  \n\n\n#### Tang Lici and Liu Yan are friends turned enemies\n\n\nThen wow, lots of things happen and everything gets a bit more complicated with a mix of smoke screens and hidden agendas. It’s confirmed that Tang Lici was a former disciple of the sword killing technique but wasn’t the only one who survived. Liu Yan, the pipa player, is also still alive. Liu Yan has made TL his sworn enemy and wants TL to suffer before death. TL decides to go after LY in response.\n                                                     \n    \nThere’s a bigger insidious movement going on that may be connected to TL, LY, and their fallen sect. The lore starts 10 years ago with a battle between 7 martial art masters of Jianghu and an imperial advisor of the previous dynasty, Yique Yinyang who seems to have lost leading to the current period of peace. That said, Yique Yinyang has left ripples in Jianghu with his development of a poisonous pill meant to control the masses while masquerading as a cultivation enhancement pill. Those who take the ‘blood ghost pill’ must take it for life or suffer death. \n\n\n#### What we know by the end of ep 3:\n                                               \n\n* Zhong Chunji and Chi Yun realize the wedding guests were actually poisoned to mimic the sword killing technique. Yang Shangqing was the killer but was coerced by Liu Yan into framing Tang Lici.\n* Yang Shangqing had blood ghost pills in his possession and was killed during his questioning.\n* YS’s assassin, Jiang Cheng, is chased down and revealed to be the son of the Yanmen sect leader. Turns out he was secretly poisoned with the pills a year prior. He dies from its effects in the presence of TL.\n* TL is accused of his murder and Feng Chuanxiang, the best friend of JC, shows up to clear TL’s name. He’s somehow also involved with Liu Yan.\n* FC offers to team up with TL to find answers about JC’s poisoning. TL refuses and nudges Chi Yun and Zhong Chunji to follow FC while TL investigates on his own (with Miss Shei).\n* All roads lead to Shisan Tower. FC runs into JC’s uncle, Jiang Qingyu, who offers to team up with FC. Both go to Shisan Tower’s outpost at the Buhuan Tower to buy/barter for information about JC’s poisoning unaware that ZC and CY are tailing them.\n* Jiang Qingyu betrays FC with intent to kill him.\n\n\n## Episodes 4-5\n\nEp 4 starts with action as Chi Yun and Zhong Chunji join the fight to save Feng Chaunxiang. After a flashy fight, Jiang Qingyu retreats briefly in order to lay a trap. Tang Lici joins the party and Jiang Qingyu admits to poisoning his nephew Jiang Cheng.\n\n\n#### Just when a conclusion is soon approaching Tang Lici tells us to buckle up because we’re not done yet:\n\n\n* FC turns out to be an imposter and apparently the real FC died 6 months ago at the hands of JC.  \n* Fake FC reveals himself as both Hua Wuyan *AND* Cao Huang, who are direct followers of Liu Yan. In true villain fashion they confirm that all the events within the floating abyss of Bushan Tower was done in efforts to eliminate TL. *Side note: Apparently 2 souls are sharing a single body of fake FC and somehow they can also shape shift into other people? The whole thing is wild honestly.*\n                                                 \n\nThe tragic circumstances of Jiang Cheng is fully explained to the Yanmen sect. Master Jiang mourns the death of his son and the betrayal of his brother but pledges to help TL investigate the poison pills. Things are wrapping up for the Yanmen sect with Chunji planning to take JQ back to the Sword Alliance as a prisoner. A new character, The Sword King Yu Qifeng, shows up at Yanmen pass to intercept prisoner JQ. \n\n\nWe get a small flashback of how Tang Lici started his life in Zhoudi Tower with master Fang Zhou. The flashback ends with master Fang Zhou’s death. I guess TL killed him?\n                                                      \n\n#### Onward to ep 5:\n\nTang Lici determines that his new lead is elder Yu Qifeng. TL prepares for his journey to the Sword King’s city by making a stop at the Fallen Shisan Tower to pick up an assassin who’s good at discretion and tracking.\n\n\nThe assassin in mind is none other than Shen Langhuan, the Porter of the Floating Abyss. Tang Lici and the Chief of Shisan Tower ~~fight~~ barter aggressively over the terms of assassin Shen’s one year contract to TL. The chief, fascinated by TL’s body, speculates that TL is using the martial arts of the fallen imperial advisor, Yique Yinyang, while also having the torso of his master Fang. Eventually the chief gives in and allows Shen Langhuan to work under TL.\n\n\nElsewhere we find out that:\n\n\n* JQ purchased the poison pills from Sword King Yu and is killed. \n* The Sword Alliance elders dismiss Chunji’s report and warnings. They readily suspect Tang Lici (and the Yanmen sect) but are still playing it by ear.\n\n### Any thoughts?\n\n\n",

    "content": "After Fated Hearts I was having a hard time getting into any dramas. But yesterday I started Sword and Beloved which was my least anticipated drama but it's sooooooooooo good??? I've been waiting to see posts on it but I can't find any discussion post on this drama so I made this post (THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL DISCUSSION POST BTW)\n\n----------------------\n**Male lead**\n\nFugui, my cold cute killing machine!!! Honestly, when I first heard about his character set up I thought he might be boring like the ml of another Cdrama airing right now but he has so much more depth to him. Him getting obsessed with a cricket when he was a child because that was the only living thing and his only friend in his house, obsessing over maps because he has never seen the sky and lands beyond his cage, being a literal killing machine but getting annoyed at a spider because she keeps delivering him love letters and  his sad daddy issues 😭. IM TIRED OF SEEING DAD'S TRYING TO GET THEIR SONS TO KILL THEM (Yes I'm looking at u fated hearts 😑😑😑) The story is from his and fl's point of view 80% of the time and from both their point of views you realise what a lonely soul he is. Even his best friend tells the fl how he may seem strong and cold but he'll absolutely do anything for the slightest bit of love or care. All of this makes you realise what a sad character he is and you instantly get attached to him!\n\n--------------\n\n**Female lead**\n\nThe female lead is adorable but she is BY NO MEANS A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS!!! She is weak but smart enough to help the ml and even save him when he's in danger! I love how she is smart and isn't just a clumsy cutie. Their team work is everything!If you like Ling Miao Miao from Love Game in Eastern Fantasy you might like her! They aren't exactly similar but they are cut from the same cloth. We haven't really learned much about her but I think we'll find out about her story more slowly as the episodes are aired.\n\n-------------\n\n**Plot, Romance, Bromance** \n\nI loveeeeee how the story is progressing. Compared to the previous 2 dramas in the series this one is definitely my favourite. You get to see flashbacks from Love in Pavilion and a few nods to the drama and it's honestly so emotional 😭. THERE IS NO MISUNDERSTANDING, I REPEAT NO MISUNDERSTANDING between the leads 😭😭😭 and the romance is literally soooooo cuteeeeeeeeeeeee. The way they flirt but don't really flirt is fun to watch. Give me more of it🤭. Bromance? The troublemaker SML and the calm calculative Ml are enough to make chaos together 😏. The only thing I don't like are the spider animations in episode 1 and half of ep 2. They leave a bad taste. I also don't like the sound effects in the first ep, they were super loud and even somewhat unnecessary but thankfully all that was limited to the first episode.",

The first six episodes, which I did recap, were a slog to go through, namely because the plot seemed so monotonous — attack, dazzling fight, pursuit, attack, dazzling fight. And me having zero idea who’s who and what’s going on or why I should care.\n\nWell, I'm glad to report that after the seventh episode, *Blood River* improved a lot, as if the writers finally remembered what made *Blood of Youth* so good in the first place: the quiet moments where they explore the bonds between our characters and the deep dilemmas that they have to deal with in this crazy *jianghu.*\n\nLet's get on with the show!\n\n# Su Muyu is captured; Prince Langya is the new target\n\n[Prince Langya](https://preview.redd.it/958v5gblufxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0b8dc65ec8316f7425c5795cc33322073101d62)\n\nPolitical machinations are afoot, and Yi Bu captures Su Muyu, drugging him with a poison that renders him in a trance-like state and without internal energy, then tossing him in prison.\n\nI am 100% **unsurprised** that Su Changhe decided to take the job that Su Muyu turned down flat — just to get him out of prison.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97biqhbpufxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44a44638801e35a1b090202a9883337630f29ca4\n\nHis first attack on the prince failed because Li Xinyue beat him flat. (It's very cool to see Wu Jie's mother! I love these callbacks to *Blood of Youth*.)\n\n[Women warriors always favour red, apparently](https://preview.redd.it/nbjz302rufxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1afefdfd1ff5aa60a931513ce457c850e91fe0b8)\n\nSu Zhe also joins in by barging into a private meeting Langya was having with a monk at a temple...\n\nI squeed a little when I saw Wuxin’s master (much younger) talking to Prince Langya. They even talked about the young Wuxin and how Langya wished for Wuxin to live a normal life (sorry, my prince, ain't gonna happen).\n\n[Wuxin's master!](https://preview.redd.it/5jsh5ljuvfxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a903662fc4940b159cfebb8075e19e1670e273d3)\n\nHonestly, each time I see the dashing, younger Prince Langya (spoilers from *Blood of Youth*, please don't click if you have not watched it) &gt;!I feel so sad, and I grit my teeth wondering why all C-drama emperors are such bricks when it comes to identifying their real enemies. It's also kinda depressing that eventually, the bad guys succeed in getting Langya killed, all probably quietly supported by the emperor, who has always been insecure about Langya's military power. I will always remember my frustration at the emperor lamenting, towards the end, \"How disappointed must he have been when I ordered his death!\" WELL, DUH!!&lt;\n\n# Su Muyu’s Past as the Heir of No-Sword City\n\nAs Muyu gives in to the drug, he dreams of his past.\n\n[UGH SO SAD](https://preview.redd.it/gub7y6iuufxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad9338b7f3cd61f57efd8c964f2f9ef241df5fab)\n\nI feel so sad for that kid, who once had a secure life with a family that loved him and a promising future as the heir of No-Sword City. Seeing his father push him away in that little raft when No-Sword City fell... my heart aches a little.\n\n[SO SAAAAAAAD](https://preview.redd.it/b7sufuhwufxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58ae257053bc78c33fc0361c7a02a2472e04ff6d)\n\nHe even hallucinates his father sharing a cell next to him. And my heart, again, broke a little for him when he tries to reassure the hallucination of his dad that despite his difficult life, he had friends by his side. (Do you mean *friend*, because you're not exactly swimming with trusted buddies in An He.)\n\n[\\\\\"You suffered so much all these years.\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/crksnvnzufxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1df4797dd5b8e1acaced3755cdbc6ce76b3cf2b7)\n\n[\\\\\"It's okay, I had friends at my side.\\\\\" \\(Me ugly crying inside as he lies to a hallucination\\)](https://preview.redd.it/kut8eo63vfxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a79d5ffc3ea0c0cb7fc19cf9ea9c84977e097a30)\n\nSo, we know that Muyu's next mission is to get to the bottom of No-Sword City's demise. I wonder, however, why Muyu is reluctant to use his true name, Yue’an. But he certainly has not forgotten how No-Sword City fell or how his father died.\n\n# The Chinese New Year Dinner\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8q0awe7evfxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f738e06b10a2f0c5f251576f94bfd9fb7ebb519c\n\nI loved this flashback, even if it was the saddest thing I've seen. And this is what Blood of Youth excelled at too - that campfire moment with Wuxin, Wu Jie and Xiao Se &gt;!where Wu Xin taught Wu Jie some moves !&lt;, our senior brother Tang Lian's moments with the boys ... things like that.\n\n*Whispers: But the writers still can't write romance worth a damn. I feel zero chemistry between Muyu and Miss Miracle Healer.*\n\nAnyway, the young Su Changhe and Su Muyu were on a mission when they decided to rest outside a poor woman's house. It was Chinese New Year, and they reminisced about Chinese New Years they'd had. Changhe never had a CNY dinner, while Muyu's CNY dinners were wonderful, but I bet they brought him pain because of what he lost.\n\nChanghe, ever the rogue, initially wanted to steal some food when he smelled something delicious, but Muyu stopped him, reminding him that ordinary people only get one good feast a year.\n\nUnexpectedly, an old woman invited them to share dinner, saying it hurt her heart to see them not at their homes for dinner.\n\nAfterward, they left her what little money they had, watched fireworks together, and for a brief instant, they weren’t assassins or fugitives — just two people basking in the fragile beauty of an ordinary night.\n\nIt’s these quiet moments that make *Blood of Youth* special. Such a small, human moment, yet so much more impactful than those flashy fights.\n\n# The Rescue Mission: Unexpected Allies\n\nAs Su Muyu’s capture sets events in motion, alliances begin to shift. But never in a million years did I expect Mu Ciling to be recruited to their cause.\n\n[Even Mu Ciling found it hilarious that he is being roped in to save Muyu.](https://preview.redd.it/3gf7xs5ivfxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39206cdb23efff25629f94d5954e287f9af3386e)\n\n(By the way, the new Xie clan head, Xie Qidao, is surprisingly cheerful and sunny for a man raised in the crazy world of Dark River as an assassin.)\n\nAnother unexpected addition is the Water Official, who slaughters the rest of the Officials.\n\nWell, it turns out that the whole thing, including Muyu being captured, was part of an elaborate plan. But to do what, exactly? My guess is they know the bad guys will not let them off so easily, and this is their way to wriggle out of the situation.\n\n[This is admittedly pretty cool](https://preview.redd.it/0p347lnmvfxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=424b52fc25c97801ef95ba2da90e8afbe76adab1)\n\nThe episode ends with Muyu using his clan's secret technique to escape from prison.\n\n# Random thoughts\n\nI really pity those who do not understand Mandarin, because not only is the subs, well, sub-par, they sometimes decide to not translate complete sentences, as if thinking: \"Yeah, they don't really need to know *that.*\"\n\nIt also massively bugs me that they called \"An He\" (which literally means Dark River) Blood River.\n\nMinor things but each time the sub pops by on my screen I wanna shake the translator a bit.\n\nAlso another pet peeve - I get that it's the trend to make the story gallop from the first episode, but writers keep forgetting the golden rule: Make us care for the characters first. Tell us why we should bother with them. Instead, the show tossed, literally, six episodes of non-stop battles at us.\n\nImagine how many viewers they'd have lost because of this, especially if they had never seen Blood of Youth or Dashing Youth before.\n\nOk, rant over!\n\nI'm just glad that the gritty storytelling of BoY is kinda back here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j2i99w7rxfxf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e443379a7d52da56ccf8a1f56c2287ddaa14eb9e\n\n# Questions\n\n* What were your favourite moments in this episode?\n* Did you feel like quitting this show like I did?\n* What do you think is Muyu's real goal with his “elaborate plan”?\n* What was the most exciting moment for you in these episodes?\n* Which scene or performance stood out the most, even without big fights or special effects?\n* Did the tone of the story grab you more this time or are you still waiting for that emotional hook?\n* How do you feel about the pacing so far? Too slow, too fast, or just right for this kind of story?\n* Which relationship or character dynamic do you find the most interesting at this point?",

    "content": "So I'm watching this on YouTube. Am super glad that it's available for free in 1080p and with subtitles. The EN Subtitles are pretty good especially for a periodic CN drama which are obv very hard to translate. Just have a major nitpick over the supremely bizarre decision to give all the concubines French translated names? It breaks the immersion quite a bit. It isn't so bad when its a name that's more common in English such as Fleur, but there are some that are extremely French e.g. Honnête, Estime and Astuce.\n\nI feel it would have been much better to just follow the standard romanisation and keep the Chinese names. E.g. 端妃 is Consort Duan rather than Honnête\n\n敬妃 is Consort Jing rather than Estime\n\n莞常在 is Attendant Wang instead of Smile\n\nIf they wanted to keep the meaning of the Chinese name it would be better added as a footnote when it becomes relevant.\n\nIt's just annoying me me greatly ATM because I'm still in the early episodes and don't know everyone yet. The way I watch I try to listen to the audio and refer to subtitles for what I can't easily understand in Chinese. So having to translate from French to English to Chinese to find out who they're talking about is confusing.",

So he does still love her!  And here I was taken in by his cold and stoic demeanor…\n\nExcept in order to save Ming Yi and her dad he has created another spirit well, which means a Heavenly Grief relapse is imminent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmw1rk3h9dxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a79958c03a019d29145425a8f5f9536abc5443fe\n\nAnd of course he chooses to hide this from her. That and some secret he learned when his master’s painting burned and another painting sprung up in its place. Buxiu saw it too. But Bozai instructs him not to tell Ming Yi about it.  I wonder what it could be. Come on writers. Don’t keep us in suspense!  \n\nWhy are Ming Yi and Bozai still looking at each other like strangers?  Because somehow Ming Yi feels that she had the life he was supposed to have. And Bozai spouts some mumbo jumbo about how even though he doesn’t blame her, every time he sees her he is reminded of his past. So just like that, the two are no longer a couple, again.  I swear, at this point it feels like the writers are just 為虐而虐 (creating angst for the sake of angst), and I am totally over it. \n\nIn either case, Bozai takes Ming Yi to the marriage stone and erase their names from it. And we get to see both cry prettily.\n\nI mean, this far into the drama, it does not take a genius to figure out that this must be another instance of noble idiocy raising its ugly head. So what is Bozai up to? Is it because he thinks the Heavenly Grief might kill him?  The secret he learned from Bo Yulan’s painting?  A combination of both? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qo1t24ye9dxf1.jpg?width=2426&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb09d90a1331f18772126160728c59ccc2575c12\n\n# Ji Bozai gets cancelled\n\nSo Bozai takes his rightful place as the crowned prince of Yaoguan Mountain, and Ming Yi reveals her true identity to her Jixing Abyss friends. \n\n[I love their reaction when they find out that Ming Yi is Ming Xian. ](https://preview.redd.it/vzebxctc9dxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e08319dfe76ffbc54a6a28a67bf960db9f80f7e2)\n\nThey all still believe in Bozai though, as Ming Yi points out that Bozai is probably only trying to take control of Yaoguan Mountain so he can work with the Jixing Abyss to keep Zhushui Spiritual State in check. But the people of Jixing Abyss are not so magnanimous. As complaints about Bozai come pouring in, Tianji has no option but to denounce Bozai and strip him of his warrior status. Suddenly, the streets of Jixing Abyss are littered with flyers detailing Bozai’s “crimes”. \n\n[Tianji strips Bozai of his warrior status. Honestly, as far as sanctions go, this is more symbolic than practical, but it is an example of how a wise ruler must make decisions that are not always just to maintain peace. ](https://preview.redd.it/gmwz3ud99dxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=050153908d90b55d0823b559eedd6669c94b1c5a)\n\n[Ming Yi pulling down flyers denouncing Bozai. It’s ironic that people are calling Bozai ungrateful, when it is them who have forgotten that Bozai was the one who gave them the blessed rain. ](https://preview.redd.it/6hyk02j49dxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01fa8248d1d435e96bd0bfaea42b8c2cda020f12)\n\n# Situ Ling shows his true colors\n\nAll the participants of the Qingyun tournament are getting ready to enter the Zhuojin Tower to inspect the arena. \n\n[Just posting this because of how cool everyone looks. ](https://preview.redd.it/rkns44609dxf1.jpg?width=2414&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63ed923527da4746b2ad22cb3f7e1595e21656dd)\n\nBut before they can do so, Ming Xin arrives and lures Ming Yi to the Dragon Carp Terrace. He pretends that has has captured Situ Ling to make Ming Yi lay down her weapon and kneel before him, but Bozai arrives to disrupt his plans. \n\n“You got yourself into this state for this mole from Zhushui Spiritual State?” Bozai asks Ming Yi.\n\nSo now all masks are off.  Situ Ling, or I should really start calling him Chao Yuan now, knows that both Ming Yi and Bozai know that he has fully embraced the dark side. Bozai also points out that in order to practice the Illusory Assassination Technique, he has to have killed at least ten innocent victims. \n\nChao Yuan tries to kill Ming Xin (is he dead?) with Ming Yi’s hairpin and attacks Ming Yi and Bozai.  Ming Yi and Bozai skedaddles out of there. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xi5q9h4y8dxf1.jpg?width=1635&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c99f78917e2471cce65cac26c46dd31e53462f7b\n\n# Other notable developments and observations\n\n☁️Er Shi Qi is back with a new hairdo. And we learn that he is called Er Shi Qi because he cost Ming Yi twenty-seven spiritual stones.  \n\n[”You can eat whatever you want to it. You can climb wherever you want to climb. You can get on the bed even when you shed.  Welcome home. How is wherever your family is. ” I like their love language. ](https://preview.redd.it/c6ybsjjv8dxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=318cce0c10fd8787e88cd8cb5af3c384f6ce002d)\n\n☁️Bozai dons new threads.  That’s it.  That’s the notable development. \n\n[I think I prefer Bozai in black…Oh, who am I kidding. Hou Ming Hao looks great even in rags. But I do like seeing him lovingly wiping down Nirvana, a gift from Ming Yi. ](https://preview.redd.it/np31rpps8dxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25b6413c11ef24c6ec89da4b4558e6f688d0e986)\n\n☁️Yaoguan emperor tries to capture Ming Yi using an artifact that Ming Yi created even though he looks down upon artifacts. What a hypocrite?  He also refuses to let Tianlin go when Ming Yi begged him. It’s a maddening scene to be sure, but I think it serves to severe all ties Ming Yi may feel towards him and paves the way for when Ming Yi has to go against him in the future. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qm12wl0q8dxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e32e1aaacceab87d30ca4bd540e706f750a6c87\n\n☁️It’s nice to see Nanny Xun again.  She is a reminder that Bozai still has a home to return to. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ypmq1so8dxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fef270c25f9514f2f46e797d93d33d99c176d650\n\n☁️Yanqiu really likes Tianji but just wants her to be happy.  This prompts Ming Yi to say that she’s finally found a group of people who have her backs. I love scenes of the team bonding. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b97pfwzl8dxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7bf901d124b53adc9642ace19d288204e608248\n\nSo that’s it.

That’s when it finally dawned on Ming Yi that Bozai had secretly given her the life-saving drug.\n\n[I kind of wish this fight scene involved more fighting \\(think Legend of Shen Li\\) and not just two people throwing force fields around. ](https://preview.redd.it/0fq9pw1pibxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86e182cb9cbda66c9f21b2f3b90895692915f050)\n\n[🎵The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus…](https://preview.redd.it/fndi3n9tibxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ed8489ee8237c15a015e353577483ef392cbf6e)\n\nSo Ming Yi confronts Bozai who finally admits to giving her the drug. The two then hugs it out, and I am relieved that these two have finally put the last piece of secret behind them. Bozai says that he doesn’t want Ming Yi’s gratitude, and Ming Yi says that he should know her well enough to know that she’s never going to like someone just out of gratitude.  You hear that, Situ Ling?\n\n[As frustrated as I was with Bozai for keeping the secret from Ming Yi, I actually think it’s pretty in keeping with his characterization do quietly perform a selfless act without expecting anything in return. ](https://preview.redd.it/2ox3uzfwibxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=721d371fad3e248423f2baee7d83cd340b20dfb9)\n\nIt is too bad that Ming Xin managed to escape after distracting Ming Yi with the revelation.  But if he hadn’t, perhaps our couple would not have learned another huge secret.\n\n㊙️Ming Yi is a Bo descendant!  After capturing Ming Xin and using the soul-seizing spell on him, Ming Yi and Bozai learns this shocker which prompts Ming Yi to demand some truth from her mother/the empress.\n\nTwenty-one years ago, Bo Yulan and Bo Yucen arrive at Yaoguan Mountain. Bo Yucen falls in with a Yaoguan warrior, gets pregnant, and dies while giving birth to a daughter. At the same time, the empress gives birth to a son without spiritual veins. To keep her status as the empress, the empress swaps out the two babies and raised the Ming Yi as her own.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qe0kq08jbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad2c62d535e467695d41d7614525329261dcb6bf\n\nAnd who should her father be but She Tianlin, who was languishing in jail at the time of his daughter’s birth for consorting with a foreign immortal. After he gets out, he works hard to become the leader of the Yaoguan warriors so he can spend time with Ming Yi and eventually become her master.\n\nHonestly, this is a secret that should surprise no one who has been paying attention. But it does lead to some very touching moments between the father and daughter. And it also puts into perspective all of their past interactions in which he acted the exasperated but doting father. And now I have another character to worry about.\n\nTV god, oh please TV god, do not kill this guy I beg you…\n\nI also liked it when she calls him 佘老頭(old man She).\n\n[It was both hilarious and touching how he keeps on hitting her head while she looked like she is about to cry. Bozai had to step in and stop him. But even then it didn’t dawn on him that Ming Yi now knows the truth](https://preview.redd.it/h6qow79djbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2d29180e2662faa620ce48e6ef3d970b769d3e4)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ke20pevijbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dca24e426465281cdc0a6a779ada6d430302787c\n\n[Also loved the father and son-in-law bonding moment.  Tianlin can’t resist telling chicken neck to stand upright below reluctantly making the sign of respect.](https://preview.redd.it/cs6136mglbxf1.jpg?width=2405&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edfadf81653ed1f066ffa22dab7354ae6d177000)\n\n㊙️Bozai is the real prince of Yaoguan!  Again, this should surprise no one. By looking at the memories left embedded in Bo Yulan’s painting, Bozai learns that Bo Yulan left him on the side of an road after taking him out of Yaoguan Mountain. Years later, when Bo Yulan finds out that a child with a mark on his forehead has been spotted in the Sunken Abyss, she resolves to find a child to atone for her abandoning him.\n\nAt the time Bozai is looking at his master’s memories, Ming Yi has also figured it out.  As she rushes to him, she can feel his pain through their heart imprint.\n\n[I hope he remembers that he still has Granny Xun, Buxiu, and Ming Yi.](https://preview.redd.it/f18k2asljbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b711605235fa9a1d0c78dc5d0497564a48020b34)\n\n[The heart imprint is again working when it’s convenient. ](https://preview.redd.it/yefrkxupjbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cc316863161c728d1a54749f2df1d51e27f7f7f)\n\nWhy won’t these two hug it out?\n\nAnd it looks like Bozai’s Heavenly Grief may be on the verge of relapsing?\n\nSo Bozai goes to see his mother. But unlike the other joyful reunion between Ming Yi and her father, this meeting is anything but joyful. As Bosai said, the empress is just a stranger to him.\n\n[“I am a failure as a mother.”  In more ways than one lady, because you failed not only 1 but 2 children. ](https://preview.redd.it/gmztt9hulbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ac36b0e79be9dfbaf765a2fdf3040f43902a6db)\n\n# Reclaiming his birthright\n\nBozai and Buxiu deliberately let Ming Xin escape so they can carry out the next part of their plan.\n\nI must say that I really enjoyed the glee on Buxiu’s face as he tortured Ming Xin.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2iyic4iwlbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14a94365bcf07324c5d0119e37224643df6fb4e6\n\nOutside of Yaoguan Palace, Ming Yi and She Tianlin crashes the ceremony that will make Ming Xin the crown prince. Min Xin is really dumber than a ton of bricks, as he attempts to paint Ming Yi as a traitor.  Ming Yi easily refutes his claim by whipping out the recording mirror that contains the footage of him colluding with Hanfeng to make Yaoguan lose at the Qingyun tournament.\n\n[Ming Yi looks gorgeous here and the mask is badass. ](https://preview.redd.it/z2u8sccyjbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a143c3e51e109c31ae1ff090302e36b49669e6b1)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6efkya52kbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29ffc0e56b616f63e0f35620e60840361c85e90a\n\nShe then tells them the story of how two babies got swapped and introduces Bozai as the real crown prince of Yaoquan Mountain. Ming Xin tries to attack Ming Yi and gets injured by Bozai. The emperor sentences both Ming Xin and his mother to the ultimate punishment, whatever that is…\n\nSo all’s well that end…Oh Wait…the emperor wants to punish Ming Yi and Tianlin for their deception. Tianlin is to be struck by lightning while Ming Yi is to be stripped of her spiritual veins. Doesn’t he harbor any love or even a little sympathy for the girl he knew for over two decades and who helped him win seven Qingyun tournaments? But then again, he didn’t seem to feel any sadness when he punished Ming Xin either. Birds of the same feather flock together. He and his empress deserve each other.\n\nThe episode ends with the emperor trying to suck Ming Yi and Tianlin into this golden pagoda. Why is Bozai not doing anything?  Ming Yi and Bozai barely looked at each other during this whole sequence, and Bozai seems to have reverted to his cold, stoic self that we met at the beginning of the drama. This has got to be an act and part of their plan to gain control of Yaoguan and rid the six realms of the injustices of the Blessed Rain system. Correct?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4iyicbylbxf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c073c1078ca0ba402ce0298883ac699014dd298c\n\nAnd with that, we have only one episode to go until the express package drops. I expect a lot of us are not going to get much sleep tonight.\n\nIn the meantime, drop your thoughts on these episodes in the comments below.",

Mao Xiaotong and Zhang Binbin deliver incredible performances, and the story progresses beautifully.\n\nWe get to see Ye Sibei find her strength, stand up for herself, and chase what she truly wants — and Zhang Binbin as a supportive and protective husband is absolutely swoon-worthy \n\nI don’t want to spoil too much, but this drama is truly worth watching ❤️\n\nHad to do a repost cause I forgot to add the name of the drama.

The competitors must adjust their AI and undergo professional training, working together with their teams to defeat opponents and claim victory.\n\nMars (played by Joseph Zeng Shunxi), a top, “god-level” professional player in China, is facing a bottleneck in his career. Lin An (played by Zhang Kangle), a small-town repairman with exceptional talent in AI Hero competitions but from a humble background, crosses paths with him. Due to an unexpected elevator accident, the two swap bodies and lives.\n\nIn an instant, Mars falls from the pedestal of being the center of attention and is forced to be trapped in an unfamiliar body. He must face the hardships of ordinary life and is also unwillingly drawn into an unsolved case from the past. In this absurd identity swap, he is forced to reexamine his original motivations that had been obscured by fame and fortune.\n\nWhile borrowing Mars’ identity, Lin An tastes fame for the first time but suffers from constant doubt. In the end, he proves his ability through his own talent and hard work.\n\n&gt;!The two youths, who exchange lives due to the accident, go from being opposed to standing together. As they uncover the truth of the past and stride side-by-side in the journey toward the world championship, they reshape their dreams, sense of responsibility, and self-identity.

As Shopkeeper Wang proudly shows off the collection to them, we see Changhe checking out the value of the items and the robustness of the pawnshop's security measures. Muyu keeps a broader perspective - what this collection means for Anhe's relationship with the pawnshop and other organisations in the jianghu.\n\n[Their Achilles' heels \\(of a kind\\): family and material power](https://preview.redd.it/8quux238n9xf1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c262670a3f41871c2cf854d5186d856eb7d6ac35)\n\nThey encounter the Three Officials, who hold a token from the pawnshop, and Shopkeeper Wang reveals the catch: one must have both key and token in order to redeem anything from the collection.\n\n[Zhuang Hanyan, is that you?](https://preview.redd.it/ep4fuemxx9xf1.png?width=674&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1a727c53c81579c52abd44181e5666db89c711a)\n\nThe Officials also give a glimpse of the next part of the mystery behind Anhe, with a mysterious invitation to meet a man in Tianqi City. Muyu and Changhe cook up a plan.\n\n# Context-setting\n\nMuyu enters Tianqi City alone and does a reminiscence tour of places he once visited with his father.\n\nThe Three Officials are ambushed on their way to Tianqi City. Surprise - they have names, and the Water Official (my favourite!) wants to reclaim his identity as Su Henshui. Fun fact: 恨 *hen* can mean resentment, hatred, or regret. Hatred towards the water? Waters of hatred?\n\nSu Changhe returns to Yellow Springs and adopts Hongying the boat person into the Mu family. The Shopkeeper tells him that the Officials gave him a fake token, and that the real token is still in the hands of the Shadow Sect.\n\nSu Zhe gathers intel for Muyu - the Shadow Sect is opposed to Prince Langya, who set up new security devices (e.g. the Four Guardians) that have robbed the Shadow Sect of its power. The true motive of the shenanigans from the start of the show was to eliminate Tang Lianyue, one of the Guardians, and everyone else was just collateral damage 🤷\n\n# The real state of affairs\n\n[We meet a new antagonist: Zhuo Qing, former Great Eunuch, who also has some kind of accent](https://preview.redd.it/6i9m90v1y9xf1.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2fd5803d780d87a70b23e034b7df71c357ced6d)\n\nMuyu decides to bring forward his meeting with the Shadow Sect. Yi Bu threatens him with the Shadow Sect's long history of control over Anhe, and reveals the heretofore unknown existence of **Wanjuan Tower**, where the Shadow Sect stores dossiers on Anhe members. He also takes the chance to give Anhe a new task: assassinating Prince Langya.\n\nMuyu responds that a) it's really none of Anhe's business, being a non-jianghu matter; and b) it's not a state affair, but a matter of personal desire. He tries to negotiate with Yi Bu to sever the relationship between Anhe and the Shadow Sect in return for the assassination, but Yi Bu refuses. Before leaving, Muyu threatens that if the Shadow Sect leaks Anhe's details, they will in turn come to Tianqi City and destroy the Sect.\n\nMuyu and Su Zhe discuss their next moves: how to use the planned assassination to take down the Shadow Sect and to destroy Anhe's records in Wanjuan Tower.\n\nYi Bu tasks the Three Officials with capturing Muyu, so that he can have leverage to bargain with Changhe. Yi Bu acknowledges that the First Prince is likely to cast the Sect aside, so he wants to strike before that happens.\n\n[jiao fang si\\~\\~](https://preview.redd.it/pqhfmzq5t9xf1.png?width=1412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da8ff89a7b8696ee1459e43b2dda3a6b9e536c20)\n\nFun interlude: Su Zhe takes Muyu to a pleasure house to \"test\" him. Our boy is super uncomfortable (I feel you) and only wants to listen to music. It's a trap, they are separated, and the Officials ambush Muyu in the street.\n\n[The final bosses?](https://preview.redd.it/b086icdrn9xf1.png?width=1033&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cec648464e18220ff5102e695b7b0302e3bfecac)\n\nWe have a fun 3 v 1 fight that turns into a 3 v 4 (that Immortal Brush power looks super cool), but somehow Muyu still ends up captured and in the Shadow Sect prison. Zhuo Qing and the First Prince are rightfully skeptical of this \"win\".\n\n# Some thoughts\n\nNow that we've left ~~Kansas~~ the jianghu, there's less fighting and more thinking &amp; talking, as is the city way.\n\nSu Changhe is supposed to be strategically gifted so IDK why he's going around telling everyone that Su Muyu is his ultimate weakness. Did he really take \"the strong can afford to be naive\" to heart?\n\n[Team work makes the dream work](https://preview.redd.it/62dtgnwuu9xf1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56daf4a3aea98d81282cca557f3c421a528bbe87)\n\nMuyu and Changhe do make an excellent team. Muyu takes the lead on matters of diplomacy, and Changhe has the sharp edge that makes things happen. Muyu has a natural tendency to inspire affection and loyalty, Changhe has cunning and ambition. It was very self-aware of Changhe to cast Muyu in the role of Patriarch in their original promise - he would be a lot better at supporting Muyu than Muyu at supporting him.\n\nOn Changhe: he's got that frightful adolescent blend of naive idealism and razor-sharp cynicism. Both he and Muyu think that this is their last obstacle to creating their new Anhe (we all know that it's not, because there's 27 episodes to go), but Changhe is definitely much less resilient (hopeful) than Muyu, and his idealism won't survive another seemingly insurmountable hurdle.\n\n# Questions\n\n1. What do you think of the Water Official and his dubious loyalties? How do you think he might change the trajectory of the plot?\n2. Are these our final bosses?\n3. For the BOY watchers - any speculation on how &gt;!we might go from here to Prince Langya's eventual death?!&lt;",

    "content": "Not quite a rave yet as I still have a lot of episodes to get through and we all know things can change very fast (I'm looking at you last 10 mins of 'My Journey to You' 👀) but I'm enjoying this drama so much so far!\n\nIt's really interesting to follow characters with such different agendas– arguably that's every character in every drama, but for some reason it just hits different in this one?\n\nI like both ML and FL main characters– ML obviously has a master revenge plan but also kind of a soft spot for helping people. Him using her as part of his plan to out dip-sh\\*t uncle was an interesting surprise. He's still a riddle wrapped in a mystery and I hope we find out more about his past. \n\nFL is very understandably, and sensibly, trying to save her own skin and I kind of love that she shamelessly uses ML to get herself out of sticky situations. It feels like a fresh take on the well-known pattern of ML rescuing FL– she's just fully taking advantage of it and allowing herself to be saved.\n\nI like that despite their outward lovey-doveyness they use as a shield, they've got a sort of unspoken agreement to help each other out– neither is under any delusions about the other. They both know the other person has a hidden agenda. \n\nI started cracking up at the end of ep 6: Situ Li catching Ming Xian red-handed. They were both so expressive there was no dialogue needed. Situ Li being like 'well now I don't think you're who you say you are' and FL 'Oh ffs after all that I'm caught out now too'.\n\nI just started ep 7 and I love her. I'm literally laughing out loud at the absolute audacity of this woman: 'I would be dead if Immortal Situ hadn't saved me' with an awesome side-eye like 'is this going to work?' and his 'You said I did what now?!' face. \n\nI'll come back when I've finished! \n\nNOTE: Please try to keep comments spoiler free, much appreciated! 🥰",

So Bozai did put the Golden Millet Dream in the scallion pancake. (Putting a life-saving medicine in his girl’s favorite food…and here I was thinking the guy can’t possibly get more swoon-worthy…my mistake…\n\n[I just can’t resist posting another picture of Bozai spitting blood. ](https://preview.redd.it/nlp0lz8cy5xf1.jpg?width=1638&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd1a546f624424ce1f0ce7a6383d9e43dbd33bcc)\n\nAnd when Buxiu finds out, he became the biggest Bozai/Ming Yi shipper.  Granted, Buxiu’s reasons are more practical than romantic, but it does leads to a conversation that is not only funny but also highlighted the difference between Bozai and Situ Ling’s mindset towards Ming Yi.\n\nBuxiu: “I wasn’t in favor of your relationship.  But now that you’ve put down such a huge betrothal gift, you have to marry her no matter what.”\n\nAnd later.\n\nBuxiu: “Now that she know everything. She better be sensible, and marry you immediately to repay you.”\n\nBozai: “No one gives someone a medicine, and expects someone to marry them in return. Further more, why would I want her to repay me?\n\nIt’s fun watching how Buxiu clucking over Bozai like a mother hen. Buxiu’s fussing over Bozai’s marriage prospects prompts Bozai to suggest that maybe it’s time for Buxiu to find an animal companion of his own.\n\n[“In my opinion, you should go meet a female dragon, a little butterfly, or a little phoenix or the like..”](https://preview.redd.it/vym1qwu7y5xf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a6bcc0243d8cd02ce968bbf7c0156529dcdcf68)\n\nI would pay good money to see that spin-off.\n\n# Situ Ling embraces the dark side\n\nSitu Ling, on the other hand, clearly expect something in return for his act of selfless sacrifice. So we get to witness his very short-lived and inept attempt to woo Ming Yi while being thwarted by Bozai at every turn.\n\nHonestly, I don’t get why Ming Yi and Bozai must continue to do this thing where they pretend that they are not already a couple and that they didn’t get to know each other in the biblical sense just a few short episodes ago. I am also a little miffed at Ming Yi for not clearly siding with Bozai, thereby giving Situ Ling a chance to act as if he has any claims on her. “You must leave with me Jie Jie…” Gag.\n\n[I love the shameless way Bozai uses his status of Ming Yi’s husband to lord over Situ Ling. ](https://preview.redd.it/x9johq82y5xf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fabdc447408e2da669f9027c6b5bcde0d042100e)\n\nBut what this sequence does, as misplaced as it feels, is finally make Situ Ling see that Ming Yi has never given him a second thought and serve as a catalyst for Situ Ling’s transformation into the final boss. As a last ditch effort to salvage something that was never there, Situ Ling comes to see Ming Yi. He starts by asking Ming Yi if she remembers that she owes him for saving her life. But when she backs away from him even as he takes a step forward, he changes his mind asking about her for repayment.  She tells him that they are just friends, and he leaves. And promptly answers Venom’s…uh…the blood ring’s call to the dark side.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65yfz6yzx5xf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0aa3484682981705fbdc90107c64f9f5bb63868\n\nSo now Situ Ling’s villainization is complete. While Ming Yi was out earlier, Fuyue snuck into her room and made a copy of the Golden Millet Dream recipe. It turns out that Situ Ling’s father is in possession of some diwu tree core, which means Situ Ling will be able to gain all the power he needs to take control of the six realms and more importantly, the woman he covets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ax6nnd6yx5xf1.jpg?width=1626&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40b534cdd379fad4eddcff9c7d92e1e82586cc8a\n\n# Bozai and Ming Yi makes up\n\nIt’s finally time for Ming Yi to make her long-awaited return to Yaoguan Mountain.\n\nAs part of the Jixing Abyss entourage, Ming Yi is able to view the place she grew up with an objective lens for the first time and realize the unjustness of the system. She realizes that while her victories made Yaoguan Mountain richer, there are whole other realms out there getting poorer and poorer. I wonder if she is going to do anything about it.\n\nIt was a heart-warming moment watching the Jixing team offer to help the warriors from the lower realm finish their chores.\n\n[“The six realms should help each other.”](https://preview.redd.it/vhvcvievx5xf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2ec6d42004b4c66fc92ab26138037e515c123e4)\n\nBut my heart really leapt during the next scene, when a heart-to-heart leads Bozai to Ming Yi lamenting that Bozai has had it rough.  But it doesn’t matter, he says, because he has his master, Granny Xun, Buxiu, and now her. And she didn’t contradict him when he said that he has her to love him.\n\n[It’s another stark contrast between a hero and a hero wannabe.  The former doesn’t let his past embittered or define him.  He counts the blessings he does have. The latter uses his past as justification for his misdeeds. ](https://preview.redd.it/hl42cskpo5xf1.jpg?width=1632&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4013cf14dae8e11f8176401c9e1762c376a5b54)\n\nAnd then it leaps yet again when Bozai restores their heart imprint.  Thank god we can finally put the fake breakup behind us. And Buxiu can finally rest easy that Bozai didn’t splurge on a betrothal gift for nothing.\n\n[I loved how playful they got and Ming Yi giggled like a little girl. ](https://preview.redd.it/ituobm5up5xf1.jpg?width=2431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd4b2ee31337c4921bff30c2a5e857af799bb86b)\n\n# The unholy alliance\n\nSpeaking of Buxiu. Ming Yi asks him to compete in the traveler’s competition in order to win the black mushroom.  And the dragon proceeds to beat 725 opponents.\n\nI think it’s fitting that Buxiu be the one to win the ingredient crucial to resurrecting his friend. But when he reaches for the mushroom, Ming Xin arrives to take it from him.\n\nBut it’s all a ploy to lure Ming Yi away so he can capture her, because Ming Xin has agreed to help deliver Ming Yi to Situ Ling. In return, Situ Ling gives him a small injection of spiritual energy with the promise of more in the future.\n\nSo stupid, arrogant Ming Xin thinks he’s got Ming Yi dead to rights (I wanted to wipe that moronic smile off his face!), only to have her break free and overpower him. Ming Yi sees Ming Xin wielding Zhushui’s spiritual energy and thinks that he’s in cahoots with the Zhushui emperor.  I wonder if Situ Ling is going to show up and finally reveal his true colors to Ming Yi.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5fj8nwsur5xf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64e42806d2493fc8d72bf8a0078c8913b371b619\n\n# Other notable moments / observations\n\nWhen Buxiu tells Bozai that Ming Yi has been taken by Ming Xin, instead of rushing to her rescue, Bozai calmly stays seated.  He knows his girl can handle the likes of Ming Xin.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7leb6gbfu5xf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c13b6bbbe063ca9ea6c52ad9d9e1e8451c589104\n\nOne of the programs at the tea gathering is a test of each warrior’s spiritual energy level.  I don’t really see a point to this exercise.  Is it just so the stronger warriors can intimidate the weaker ones?\n\n[I just wanted an excuse to post a picture of Yan Xiao.  ](https://preview.redd.it/ruxd9wxyv5xf1.jpg?width=1627&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41783f5f737970c9ba2c331d9633a71f71c80ce6)\n\nMing Xin reveals that he put the Heavenly Grief in Ming Yi’s scallion pancake.  Our girl will eat anything as long as you put it in a scallion pancake…\n\n# So there you have it.\n\nAre you  happy with the progress our couple made in these episodes?

    "title": "The Bond: Rant with *Spoilers*",
    "content": "I started watching **The Bond** recently on youtube and the drama is amazing. However, one thing that has really pissed me off is the way all the women in the drama are so freaking selfish and inconsiderate, except for Sanli and Simei of course. Simei is definitely selfish, but she gives off innocent baby of the family selfish, not cold or mean selfish lol.\n\nHowever, I don't think it would bother me as much if all the main men in the show were the same way. But except for the father of course, and other minor exceptions, they are mainly portrayed as innocent saints who can do no wrong. Yicheng can be selfish at times, but 99% of the time, he is taking care of his siblings and then his wife. Erchiang is just a fool for his shifu lol, Wei Min (the cousin) is super kind, Yiding (Sanli's&gt;! bf/hubby!&lt;) gets walked all over and poor Qiqi 😭. Also, their uncle was super kind and even Yicheng's teacher was kind and considerate, because I feel like not many men back then would &gt;!hand over their niece's address to a man!&lt; lol. Basically all the main men, except for ppl affiliated with the father, were practically angelic.\n\nBut then come in the women.... Yicheng's &gt;!wife!&lt; literally makes no sense to me. First of all she stole his news mic and news content before they even started dating. And she made so many selfish decisions when they were married. Had she not been married, then I would literally be rooting for her for taking control of her life and chasing her dreams. But you can't force someone to want what you want or do what you do. Her leaving was the best decision, and even though I am not finished, I feel like a divorce is inevitable.\n\nErchiang's wife is an actual nightmare. I like that they're both quiet ppl, but her going on these escapades with her boss, whom she loves, is insane. Why marry a man if you are literally deeply involved with someone else?? Their situation actually enrages me because these are decisions that did not have to be made at all. I get that Yicheng and his wife did have feelings for each other and even though I don't like her, they made a bit more sense. But Erchiang and his wife didn't even really love each other. &gt;! I absolutely detest seeing cheating play out, especially when it makes no sense, like with these two. They should have never gotten married in the first place, but I wholeheartedly hope they get a divorce.!&lt;\n\nAnd then Sanli's mother in law - what a selfish and inconsiderate hag. In fact, all the older women are not that nice. Their aunt is ok but she definitely has her selfish moments. But I was so happy for her that &gt;!she married again!&lt;. Her kids were being way too dramatic lol.\n\nBut back to the point  - I just wish that there was more \"nice\" representation in this show for women. This is an issue in a lot of media that really bothers me, but it seems so exaggerated in this show. A lot of shows, even ones written by women, portray the men to be so angelic and willing to give up everything for women, but the women are portrayed as so selfish, inconsiderate and even cruel. It's like, if a woman is not suffering day in and day out, she has to be horrible. She can't be nice just because she's nice, especially if she grew up spoiled as heck, or in the best conditions. In shows, it's like being kind is only reserved for women who went through the trenches, and then they get their prince charming in the end as a reward for suffering 😩.\n\nAnd no, I'm not saying all women are saints, but let's have a fair depiction of both sexes, not just one.",

    "title": "Threads of Destiny - are minidramas actually good now?",
    "content": "Halfway through the mini-costume drama Threads of Destiny (on Youtube with subs). I was eyeing it when someone mentioned it a few weeks back and I found out it was the same actress (Zhu Lilan) as in Gemini (which I tried to watch but found it too draggy and the ML actor just cannot act). She was the best thing about that drama so I made a mental note to try TOD. \n\nThen I watched Fated Hearts and fell in love with Qin Tianyu's acting as the unhinged Jinxiu emperor, so I started TOD to have something to fall back on since Fated Hearts never had enough of QTY's character (and also Jingyan &gt;!sadly didn't have a good ending!&lt;, as excepted). \n\nSo far I really like it. I have around 10 episodes left so the drama can still go haywire and mess up, but the script is surprisingly good and the pacing is nice - it doesn't feel like a minidrama with how smooth the plot flows and how much depth we get to the main characters despite the short episodes. The production quality is pretty good, it actually feels like a semi-low budget real-length and the overall cast is good. Zhu Lilan is mesmerizing - I don't know what it is with cdramas recently, but this year I've discovered more and better actresses than probably ever before. ZLL could easily be a lead in a bigger production, she has the charisma and charm, plus better acting chops that a lot of actresses who got big roles in recent years. Plus her smile is enchanting, no wonder the ML falls fast and hard.\n\nQin Tianyu is charming as the ML - he doesn't get to show as much nuance as with his role in Fated Hearts, but he can easily hold his own against the FL, and they have a very natural and cute chemistry, their couple scenes are much needed sugar for this viewer.\n\nThe premise is double-rebirth: The FL and her vicious half-sister (seems like in minidramas the half-sister is always evil) both get reborn on their joint wedding day. In their first life, the half-sister marriage a nobleman and legitimate heir (subs says 'crown prince' but he's not, he's a 世子 which I'm not sure what is, but I think it means his lineage is royal, but his family is from a side branch - or possibly just very high-ranking nobility), while the FL married the concubine-born second son. The half-sister's marriage ended in divorce and humiliation, while the FL's husband rose in the ranks as a scholar and got a government position. \n\nIn this life, the SFL wants the FL's good life for herself and insist that *she* marry the concubine-born son, while the FL marries the legitimate son. The FL decides in this life she's done with being stepped on by her sister and others, happily marries the nortorious and difficult ML and proceeds to deal with anyone out to get her in a ruthless and determined way.\n\nBoth leads are smart and capable and quickly team up to defeat anyone working against them (so far mostly against the FL since everyone is out to get her). There are the usual 'isn't this too convenient' tropes and a lot of ML catching the FL in his arms in slo-mo while the OST is playing, the obligatory bath scene and as usual for minidramas, the leads aren't shy when they kiss (so far I'd say the kisses in Gemini were steamier, but personally I prefer a CP that has good chemistry even with their clothes on and whose brain capacity also match). Nothing in the drama so far is more stupid or implausible than what happens in regular costume dramas.\n\nBefore I started on this I thought The Maid, another recent minidrama which was very good, might have been the odd one out, because other minidramas I've tried were just badly paced and with mid acting by most (except obviously ZLL who is a gem), but maybe minidramas really have upper their game both in terms of acting, pacing and especially script. \n\nAll in all TOD is shaping up to be a good drama for those who want a ruthless but charming FL who defeats her enemies with the help of an equally smart ML who falls for her because he admires her capability. Also for those Fated Hearts viewers who were Jingyan fans and need some sugar to get over his character.",

Seeing her again felt like coming home to frozen yoghurt. ](https://preview.redd.it/5gw7ic3e63xf1.jpg?width=2556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ebd5e67c256139731c48a5c4baf6c80e2289dcd)\n\n# \n\nOn a street in Juxiao City, we get a little bit of insight into Su Mu Yu’s recent actions. \n\nOne of the reasons he stayed by the Patriarch was not just because of his loyalty but because he needed a hint into investigating the circumstances surrounding the massacre of his family, sect, and No Sword City. \n\nThe Patriarch gave him a key to find clues in Tianqi City. \n\nSu Changhe tries to convince Su Mu Yu to join The Other Shore but Su Mu Yu disagrees citing that Blood River is more complicated than what he thinks. \n\nOnce again, Su Changhe draws his blade on Su Mu Yu,  claiming they’ve always been on different paths. \n\nAs expected, Su Changhe couldn’t bring himself to hurt him. \n\nLi Hanyi, the Sword Diety and City Lord of Xueyue city joins their conversation. \n\nShe tries to convince Su Mu Yu to take charge of Blood River or either dissolve it. \n\n# Tang LianYue’s Revenge \n\nAt the SpiderNest, Tang Lianyue fights the Patriarch in revenge of his martial uncle’s death, and successfully wounds him reversing his poison.   \n\n\nThe Patriarch reminds him that there’s a deeper scheme behind his uncle’s death and chides him to be cautious.  \n\n\n\n# The End of The Patriarch \n\nSu Mu Yu and Su Changhe rushes to the scene but it was too late. The Patriarch was beyond cure. \n\nIn a solemn discussion with the two young men, the Patriarch shares how Mu Kewen(the old man guarding SpiderNest)’s death and Su Mu Yu’s loyalty made him realize he’s not alone anymore. \n\nThis conversation shows the humane side of the Patriarch and who he was beyond his identity as an assassin or a Patriarch. \n\nHe also shares how he wanted to create a different Blood River but he couldn’t. \n\nHe left the sword to both Su Mu Yu and Su Changhe, leaving them to make the decision.  \n\nHe bids them farewell after sharing his plan to set himself and the nest on fire. \n\nDespite wanting the sword for himself, Su Changhe tells Su Mu Yu that he’s willing to let go of the sword only if he’ll take it for himself. \n\nHe suggests that Su Mu Yu should be the Patriarch while he takes the position of the Su Family head. \n\nWhile they’re arguing, the water official and Mu Ciling makes an appearance to steal the sword.\n\n\n\n# Hell Palm x Eighteen Sword Array\n\nMu Ciling arrives at the SpiderNest to steal the Dormant Dragon Sword. \n\n\n\nSu Changhe fights him with the forbidden Hell Palm technique but Mu Ciling gains the upper hand, leaving Su Changhe injured. \n\n\n\nAfter a strategic collaboration, both Su Changhe and Su Mu Yu faced Mu Ciling head on.  \n\nWith a planned strike, Mu Ciling is left injured. \n\n  \n\n\n# Su Changhe: The First Nameless Patriarch \n\n\n\nSu Changhe accepts that Su Mu Yu wants to leave Blood River. Even though he was sad, he allows it and shares the location of a house he bought for him. \n\nHe also chooses to respect Su Mu Yi’s boundaries if he plans to leave without telling him his location. \n\nI find that part very sad because he already thought about the possibilities. And he already made peace with the fact that Su Mu Yu could chose to go away silently without anyone knowing where he’s hiding. \n\nAnd here’s the contrast, I think that action is more suited to Su Changhe since he’s the one who kept the organization’s existence away from Su Mu Yu for six years.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l458vmut73xf1.jpg?width=2556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84791851410c061b5d56a39e7f890feb11076b3d\n\nFortunately, Su Mu Yu decides to stay back to help Su Changhe with the reform process of Blood River. According to him Su Changhe could make it a mess because of his “greed and ambition”.   \n\n\nWith Su Mu Yi’s support, all the assassins present during the conflict in Blood River (including the Twelve Zodiacs) accepted Su Changhe as the Patriarch while Su Mu Yu became the head of the Su Family.\n\nAmidst the chaos, One of the three officials of Blood River visits the Patriarch. \n\nHe claims the Patriarch made a wrong decision in handing over the sword to the young nameless assassins and he proceeds to punish him by setting him &amp; the room on fire.  \n\n\n\nThe Patriarch did not protest as he plans to do the same to himself. \n\nI’m guessing that’s the end of the Patriarch.  \n\n\nOn the other end, Mu Yu Mo wakes up to an empty room. \n\nIf I ever transmigrate into the Blood River universe, I want to be Mu Yu Mo, please. I love how she stayed away from the conflict and recuperated in the hands of a fine man. Like, go girl. Enjoy. \n\n\n\n# A Momentary Step Away from The Dark \n\n\n\nAfter the purging of Blood River, Su Mu Yu lives in a small town with Bai He Huai where she takes in patient. \n\n\n\nIn the classic Bai He Huai style, she turns Su Mu Yu into her brand ambassador and creates a daily fan service event for her patients while charging them a very high price. \n\n\n\nAway from the cozy village, we see two new characters. A sect leader and a Prince are discussing how to exploit the new change in Blood River \n\nIn an empty temple of the Three Officials of Blood River, Su Changhe discovers a key hidden in the Dormant Dragon Sword. \n\nThis discovery explains why the three family heads were thirsting after the sword so bad. \n\n# More Flashbacks: \n\n\n\nApparently Su Mu Yu’s umbrella didn’t have magnetic powers to return his eighteen swords whenever he uses his killing array when he was younger. \n\nThe flashback reveals Su Changhe laughing at him while watching him pick up his swords one by one. \n\nLike Su Changhe said, it’s embarrassing for an assassin to start picking up swords after killing people. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9kv93gnq73xf1.jpg?width=2556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbecccce2020c2574fb41907ab82aaf3aa1064df\n\nSo, he designed an umbrella with a magnetic effect for Su Mu Yu. That's very thoughtful. I really enjoy the way they complement each other. \n\n\n\n# Su Mu Yu Should Not Touch A Cooking Spoon \n\n[There was a scene in the donghua where chickens were running away from Su Mu Yu because he killed way too many of them for his cooking attempt. ](https://preview.redd.it/blmm469y63xf1.jpg?width=2556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa6b16a9cdac62060ff661580721cf4de3650282)\n\nWhen Su Mu Yu isn’t boiling herbs for the ladies, he’s on another attempt to poison … no, cook noodles for our miracle physician. \n\nBai He Huai begs him to give up on cooking since it’s not a talent he possess but Su Mu Yu insists on trying. E for effort, yeah? \n\nWhile our two characters enjoy their quiet life, it’s interrupted by two characters. Xie Xuan and Li Hanyi. They’re notable figures in the jianghu. Xie Xuan is a Scholarly Diety while Li Hanyi is a Sword Diety. Both characters are in the other two dramas in this series. \n\nXie Xuan arrives first and cooks dinner for them, while Bai He Huai and Su Mu Yu admire his skills. Lu Hanyi joins the party with a streak of killing intent. \n\nLi Hanyi attempts to fight Su Mu Yu but Bai He Huai cleverly solves the issue by reminding her of their personal connections. \n\nBai He Huai is a huge nepo baby. She has ties to two lords of Xueyue City. She’s Bali DongJun’s cousin and grandmaster of Sikong Changfeng( all three of them are city lords of Xueyue City) \n\nAfter finding out her close ties with Bai He Huai, Lu HanYi choose to relax. \n\nThe lively gathering turned dark as Su Changhe shows up. Li Hanyi claims she was deceived as she expected Su Mu Yu to be the Patriarch. \n\n[\\\\\"keep your head safe. I'll come to take it.\\\\\" ](https://preview.redd.it/9qpb3ar273xf1.jpg?width=2556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a392c9a088333a51dd32c1be9e900e44b7152f50)\n\nAfter a brief spar with Su Changhe, she threatens to hunt down the two assassins if Blood River’s transformation never happens.   \n\n\n#  On a Quest to Unlock Blood River’s Wealth &amp; Secrets\n\n# \n\nSu Changhe shares his discovery of a secret in the sword to Su Mu Yu. \n\nAfter bidding farewell to Bai He Huai, Su Mu Yu follows Su Changhe to the Yellow Springs, a popular but secretive bank that holds the wealth of Blood River. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c71pwtft63xf1.jpg?width=2556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1d353564d321092964604daef04479e5793bd6\n\nThere they encounter a strange character who could shape shift into different people. \n\n\n\n# Personal Thoughts. \n\nSu Changhe is more brilliant than he looks. The way he maintained secrecy with the organization for six years is remarkable work. Even the heads of the three families had no idea until they met their end. \n\n\n\nAlso, these recent episodes shows a slight development in the relationship between Bai He Huai and Su Mu Yu, with him buying her favorite cake for her and playing house. It's cute. I also enjoyed the mini break away from the darkness that shrouds over Blood River. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8k1sx6ik73xf1.jpg?width=2556&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43ecb098e4eec2113e0e36f04b6dbbdbd0557e86\n\n# Tell me,\n\nWhat was your favorite scene in the recent episodes? \n\nWhat do you think of these episodes?\n\n",

    "content": "#First\n\nu/LoudAvocado1387 is hosting the [amazing episode discussions for Love in The Clouds](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/s/GqoPfvZGeO). \n\nGo join over there!\n\n^Go ^Go ^Do ^It ^Now\n\n#Second\n\nI thought I was safe. I thought I could pace myself. \n\nI. Was wrong. \n\nI. Could not.\n\nAfter being unable to watch new dramas for a month due to the *Love Between Fairy and Devil* discussions, I was excited to get into the August/September dramas I missed out on.\n\nAfter two weeks of non-stop mini-dramas, I got to it.\n\nFirst, I caught up with [Shadow Love](https://mydramalist.com/716245-shadow-love).\n\nSecond, I started [Fated Hearts](https://mydramalist.com/768987-wan-xin-ji) *(really **really** good drama btw)*.\n\nI decided to watch *Fated Hearts* before [Love in the Clouds](https://mydramalist.com/757769-love-in-the-clouds) and after binging all of the 38 episodes (with the airing schedule barely ahead of me), I needed something to fill the gap. \n\nWell, enter:\n\n#Love in the Clouds\n\nIt pulled me in slowly, but not slowly enough to be boring, just paced in such a way that you don't realise your hooked until you've watched 28 episodes in the blink of an eye and you've somehow bought the express package without realising what you were doing. \n\n**AND NOW YOU NEED TO WAIT FOR MORE EPISODES**\n\nI am going to make a more detailed post once the drama finishes but I feel like I had to make a post like this because I haven't seen enough people gush about this drama. \n\nThe chemistry is really really good, but even that is secondary to what is just **a really good drama**. \n\nI've had to force myself to not fast forward, not because it's boring, but because every part of me wants to gobble up every second of this drama as fast as possible. \n\n* The Spiritbeasts are everything. \n* The humour is light and fluffy. \n* The story is serious when it needs to be without feeling bogged down. \n\nIt is everything right now. Much like with *Fated Hearts*, I wake up in the mornings craving more *Love in the Clouds*.\n\n*A quick note:*\n\nI have seen a certain specific criticism floating around. This being that the FL holds on to that secret identity of hers really **really** tightly. She doesn't reveal her secret to the ML when I know many viewers are screaming:\n\n&gt; JUST TELL HIM. All your problems will be fixed if YOU JUST TELL HIM.\n\nWell, I would agree with the above statement, and I 100% understand that this may bother some people, but I like how long the secret identity stays secret. \n\nAfter all, if dramas had all their problems fixed within the first ten episodes, there wouldn't be enough drama to fill the (in this case) 36-slated episodes.\n\nThe payoff is worth the torture (in my opinion)\n\n\n#Go, go watch it now! \n\n\n^Im ^so ^upset ^that ^I ^caught ^up ^with ^the ^airing ^schedule\n",

Here's how you do it.\n\n# On the Desktop\n\nThis will work in Fancy Pants Editor mode, so switch to the mode by clicking on the “Switch to Fancy Pants Editor” button located at the top right corner of the text box.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xb5ht42p3bc1.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43820119f41012eff0d33a811c7a1bbcb0ae9ab9\n\nTo mark your **entire post** as spoiler-y:\n\n1.

Open the Reddit post you want to edit.\n2. Highlight the text you want to mark as a spoiler.\n3. Click on the **exclamation mark in a diamond** located in the top menu of the fancy pants editor.\n4. Click **Save** to save your changes.\n\n# Mobile\n\nTo mark your post as a spoiler:\n\n1. Tap on **Add tags &amp; flair (optional)**.\n2. Scroll down to **Universal tags** and toggle on the slider for **Spoiler**.\n3. Tap on **Apply (**at the top).\n\nTo mark a comment with spoiler tags:\n\nUse this syntax to mark spoilers on mobile: `&gt;!spoiler text!&lt;`\n\nThis will hide the text between the exclamation marks and display the spoiler text when clicked.\n\n# Some guidelines about spoilers:\n\n**DO NOT include spoilers in the post titles**\n\nMake sure that your post title does not have spoilery plot points. For example, posts with titles such as \"Love Show - everyone died!\" or \"Love Show - our main couple finally kissed in episode 20!\" will be instantly removed, regardless of how many comments are under it.\n\n\n\n**DO include the name of the show in the title of the post**\n\nThat said, please don't post overly vague titles. Please ensure that your post title contains the show's name at least. Imagine someone taking a chance to read the post only to be spoiled for a show they didn't want to be spoiled for.\n\nTitles such as \"A review\" or \"The ending of the show\" does not tell you what show is being talked about. Even if they are marked spoilers, they will be removed.\n\n\n\n**Add spoiler tags to spoilery comments**\n\nIf you're discussing a Show's plot point in a post unrelated to the Show, please tag your spoilers with spoiler tags, especially if you're dropping the comment on a post that has nothing to do with the Show. \n\nAlthough I'm generally more lenient with comments with non-spoiler-tagged comments in posts marked as \"spoilers\", comments without spoiler tags under a post that has nothing to do with the show will be removed. \n\n**Posts such as Episode Discussions, discussions about a show's ending must be marked as spoiler or it will be removed.**\n\nWhat it said.\n\n\n\nThat's it! \n\nHappy discussing!",

    "content": "By popular demand, here's where you can ask discuss the ins and outs of the CDrama industry!\n\nNow, as discussions around this topic can get SPICY (especially around actors), please abide by the following:\n\n**What's OK:**  \n1. Discussions about the acting industry, including how actors work, industry trends, and the filmmaking process, are **encouraged**. Feel free to share insights into acting techniques, career paths, and the business side of entertainment.\n\n2.  You may post about actors' roles in films or television, their contributions to the industry, and their professional achievements. Please ensure that the focus remains on their work rather than their personal lives. \n\n3. Maintain a respectful tone in all discussions. Critiques should be constructive and focused on professional aspects and acting techniques rather than personal attacks on an actors' looks, rumours etc. It is fine to critique an actor's performance, but not ok to be derogatory about them.\n\n**What's not OK**\n\n1. Comparing actors' popularity like it's some kind of race to the top.  \n\n2. Treating melon (rumours) like facts, so let's avoid accusing actors of this or that based on unverified melons.\n\n3. Being mean, rude and nasty during discussions. \n\n4. Calling the actors or other celebrities mean names or talk about them in a derogatory way. BTW, critiquing an actor's performance (it's bad/good) is fine.",

Most of all, she basically rendered her son incapable of being a good man or an effective ruler. He could've nurtured loyalty in Jingshi, making him Jinxiu's best defender through love rather than poison. Cruel and honestly, not very bright. Should've listened to your son - he had a point about killing Jingshi!\n\n# Kill Count #6: Weiran \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1k40hzts1wf1.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a61a812849533f444a826bc2274cb112859f1d8\n\nRather poetic that his closest comrades were the ones to kill him. I never really understood why he decided to betray Yixiao and stick to someone like Jingshi despite knowing all the terrible things he did. And unfortunately, the actor could not convey the complexities of his character. Is the inability to move facial muscles infectious or something?\n\n# Kill count #7: Jingshi\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ma6d90zls1wf1.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7890cafc98751f459f9fd57609fb0ff578d7f45\n\nThe man of the hour! \n\nFrankly, his character was so tedious and difficult to appreciate that I felt that I wish he had died earlier. In fact, the last arc or the last two episodes were the most difficult for me because the actor's performance was so uninspiring that I just couldn't bear watching it. I know I should stop complaining about him because it's not gonna help, but seriously, because everyone out-acted him in so many ways, it's just far more glaring.\n\nWhat I  don't understand about this episode  was  he let his  whole plan fall apart just because he  wants to kill Suige? For what, getting his girl?  Whom he threw  off a cliff the first place? And  till  the last moment  he  still thought he hada a chance with Yixiao?\n\nIt just didn't make sense for a man to put a  plan he had set in plan for decades for a moment of  jealousy.\n\nAs a character he's pretty hideous; at first you feel a tiny bit of sympathy for him, but I wonder if it's because of the way he was written or whether it was because the actor was so poor that I just could not find the complexity or the nuance in him. \n\nThis character could have been a very rich and interesting villain. In fact, he reminds me a lot about the villain in The Wanted Detective, who, at the end, made me wish for a rebirth drama for him. This one? Nah, his soul can get lost and never reincarnated for all I care.\n\n The actor could have played him as someone who was slowly going insane, losing his grip on his facade of goodness, but now we got this, whatever this is.  I think that would've been more believable  than 2nd ML syndrome:  Death because of stupid reasons made because of  extreme  jealousy :P\n\nAnd you know what's funny? I think Jingshi is not as good a fighter compared to Suige. Again, I do not know if it's the actor or because his character is truly not as capable. (They did make a point of  showing  how Jingshi  used a crossbow to fire at  Suige rather than fight him face to  face.) \n\nChen Zheyuan, if you have seen BTS footage, really shows he can move with brutality and efficiency. Kudos to the martial arts director!\n\nBuh-bye I don't miss you.\n\n# Kill count #8: Empress Wei Qingyu\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yeawk831t1wf1.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b59b9fa3c6f2ae33dd68ef715b279fcd322c86d\n\nPeople die so easily from small cuts to the neck in ancient China. Get them some band aids!\n\nIt may look pretty, but I wanna see a blood bath dang it! :P Such a poetic way to die, even if it was hugely unrealistic she died without any commotion or anyone noticing. \n\nA part of me wished she could have died under the hands of Suige, but I know that would break his brother's heart. To be honest, if she were to be left alive, she would still cause problems,  so I suppose this is the best ending for her.\n\nStill, even by dying this way she is selfish to the end, thinking about herself, not even caring that she's leaving her son  to find her body. Our boy has been traumatized left and right by the Zhuangs. I suppose it's great that none of them are left to cause him anymore trouble.\n\n# Who is the emperor?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/may77ni5t1wf1.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0536254a5c356579ec0c37464cb08e503713982\n\nOur couple looks so beautiful at the end. I actually like how they handled the succession.\n\n I know some people were dissapointed he didn't become emperor. (At least, not immediately). \n\nHonestly, I do not think that Suige ending up as an emperor would have been good for him; it would probably be the most unhappy ending for our couple. \n\nNot only would he be trapped having to watch his back constantly because, let's face it, he is not exactly popular in court. He would also have to deal with people who could eventually stab him in the back, and he would have to deal with a lot of fake people, basically people that he doesn't want to deal with. \n\nAnd then there's Yixiao - she would definitely not want the life confined to a harem, having to watch ministers plot around Suige or worse, end up having to tolerate a concubine like Suige's mother did.\n\nOur couple just want to live in peace with the people they love, and I think ultimately the drama ended for the couple in the best way possible. \n\nAnd I like that they left the ending open-ended in terms of who is the emperor. \n\n**Chengyang:** He is spending a few years away guarding the tomb. Some people say that just because he's guarding the tomb he's become a monk, but we don't really know that for sure, do we? (I may have missed something, unless someone said he 出家 (to become a priest/monk)。\n\nS,o there is a slight possibility he could be coming back, though I think he doesn't want it, and even Suige knows that.\n\nIf you tell me, his younger brother is suited to a life of peace and simplicity where he doesn't have to deal with court politics and can be with people who are honorable, true, and genuine. (You know, like monks. Hehe.)\n\nI don't think he's equipped to handle two-faced people for too long. And even if he's equipped, as we can see from the last few episodes, it will leave him so unhappy. \n\nI'd rather he live a peaceful, simple life. \n\n**Xiyang:** I think with Suige as the regent, she will be suitably trained, like he said to her many, many episodes ago; he will be the first one to defend her and fight for her. I'm still so sad that she lost the ability to carry children because of Jingshit. (Thanks to the OP who coined this magical name.) Yes, **Jingshit** because he's absolutely shit for doing what he did.  \n\nThough never say never, perhaps the miracle doctors of the Alliance can do something for her.\n\nI really like how this drama built the case for the characters' endings. They spent time making them nuanced and complex so you that can understand their motivations clearly and what they want. \n\nSo, in conclusion, I really love the ending; it's very fair to our characters and very true to their characters. And that's the best outcome I've ever hoped for a Cdrama.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd698ocbt1wf1.png?width=902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30f107e7ebf2c53f3fc2b99d38a4ee0ae5cd4125\n\n**So what do you think about the ending? Which revenge death was the most satisfying to you?**",

    "content": "So IMO, **Blossom** was the perfect watch after finishing the two recently aired dramas **Fated Hearts** and **Yummy Yummy Yummy**. I wanted to share because I saw a few posts where people are looking for something to fill the void after FH ended. I know there are a lot of new dramas to be released soon but if you want a drama to binge in the next few days and you have not already seen it, I recommend Blossom for these reasons:\n\n* If you were frustrated with the the development of the relationship in YYY and or was sad with the ending, I can confidently say that Blossom was quite the opposite! Li Yunrui is the ML in both, but in Blossom, &gt;!they are together midway, and STAY together in the most loving relationship to the end. It also has a very clear HAPPY ENDING for the couple. !&lt;Watching Blossom after YYY helped me recover because my heart was aching for Lin Yan in YYY.\n* A lot of similarities with Fated Hearts although some episodes Blossom felt a bit more lighthearted and less intense. \n   * &gt;!ML has a sh\\*t father and seeks to avenge his mother. !&lt;\n   * FL is very protective of the ML and helps him seek justice. She is not a general or martial arts expert, but she is intelligent (she has business and medical expertise). There are similar scenes near the end where she is the one who saves the ML.\n   * Themes of betrayal, within the family and imperial court, and redemptions. Tragic childhoods.\n   * Themes of loyalty.&gt;! The battalion or army stays extremely loyal to the ML general.!&lt;\n   * Both FLs basically had a$$hole exes. \n   * &gt;!Poison as a weapon of control.!&lt;\n   * A lot of conspiracies, scheming, and pins that go in the head to save lives. \n\nOther notes worth mentioning for Blossom:\n\n* No fake sibling, amnesia or noble idiocy tropes. It is a rebirth-second chance at life-change your fate story.\n* I decided to watch it for Li Yunrui and IMO, he was great in it. Meng Ziyi as the FL, does a very good job too (my first drama with her). Chemistry was good (not wow for me, but good). \n* I did wonder about about Ji Yong and his&gt;! affections for Dou Zhao... I thought that was a bit odd but necessary to explain his unconditional support for her... I guess it was never clear from the first episode for him that she was fated with Song Mo.!&lt;\n* Song Han was just as annoying in Blossom as Jingshi was in FH... but then again, I guess he did not grow up with Song Mo like Suige did with Chengyang.\n\nFor those who have watched all of these, what do you think, and do you agree? Any other points to add?",

After they split up, a cloaked figure appears before Ming Yi and who should that be but Bozai, who has come to help Ming Yi as well as lay everything out on the table. Our boy has had it with all the lies and deceit.\n\nBozai asked Ming Yi point blank if she is Ming Xian.  He says if she lies to him again, then what is between them will truly be over. And when she finally admits to the truth, a smile breaks over his face. All he wanted was for her to tell him the truth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7c8lscqjwpwf1.jpg?width=2462&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=653faa279042ba0d367fca8e6f5f1b5c59993d4a\n\nWhat follows is basically Bozai pulling out all the stops to win back his wife.  He was by turns charming, flirty, earnest, and shameless. And I just…can’t…deal…(Is it getting hot in here or what?)\n\nWhen Zhulong the ancient divine beast appears before them, he uses his body to shield her.\n\nWhen Zhulong sends them tumbling down a cavern in the ground, he cradles her in his arms. And then pretends to pass out so he can see her fuss over him.\n\nHe even brought her scallion pancakes (heated up!). And then looks lovingly at her and said that he’s now just realizing she’s far more important to him than he imagined.  She chokes on the pancakes.  He wipes pancake crumbs off her face.\n\n[“快吃吧戰神大人” \\(Eat up, my lord goddess of war\\)“](https://preview.redd.it/2si5qwlowpwf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a56d66467d6611b15ed3a012d4373818eb16e775)\n\nBut it is not all just fun and games. In between teasing her, Bozai walks Ming Yi through their past. All the lies and half-truths that got them to this point. And when he asked if she already couldn’t leave him behind when they were in Xun Ming’s illusory realm, and when she hesitated, he utters the one line that we should all strive to remember in our daily lives.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uthuucmswpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8cd8b1fda522ab0a253d951edb3aa244a76aef4\n\nTo which Ming Yi replies:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4peokr9mypwf1.jpg?width=1609&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df35af6831d6deb52c63eb59dd6dee73692d82b6\n\nAnd my heart is full.\n\n# A secret is revealed, sort of, depending on who you are\n\nSo where was I? Oh right. The Golden Millet Dream.\n\nAfter administering blood tests to both Bozai and Ming Yi, it was Ming Yi that Zhulong lets past the barrier into the Bo ancestral home.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74g09ynywpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2917641b8806da39256ed84983b7504bf2f6adf\n\nSo Ming Yi is actually the Bo descendant, not Bozai! And what’s more. It looks like She Tianlin was in on the secret all along.\n\nUm…not to nitpick or anything. But why didn’t She Tianlin send Ming Yi straight to Zhangwei Mountain after she got poisoned? Could have saved a lot of people a lot of trouble. Sure. Ming Yi and Bozai would have never fallen in love and we wouldn’t have this lovely couple to fawn over. But still…\n\nOnce inside the barrier, Ming Yi meets the divine consciousness of the Bo Yulan and Bo Yucen. They give Ming Yi the recipe for the Golden Millet Dream, but not before she swears an oath to protect all living souls even at the risk of her own lives.  If she breaks that oath, her primordial spirit will be distinguished and her soul scattered among the six realms.\n\nI must say that I not like this.  Serious oaths are always a foreshadow of something terrible to come in xianxia dramas.  I hope I am wrong though.\n\nBo Yulan also leaves Ming Yi a cryptic message about having wrong Bozai. That if he wants the truth he can find it in a place that is within reach. But that finding the truth may cause him to lose faith in all people.\n\nAgain. Alarm bells.  These women are making me nervous y’all.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jx7sthk0xpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d65fa5a18d07e12a6d6aa6cf530c9fd633c0713f\n\nAnd despite all the clues, Bozai and Ming Yi still don’t realize that Ming Yi is actually the Bo descendant?  No wonder it took Bozai so long to figure out Ming Yi’s secret.\n\nSitu Ling and Fuyue, on the other hand, figures it out immediately upon seeing Ming Yi enter the barrier. The emperor of Zhuoshui, who has a spy keeping an eye on Zhangwei Mountain, also put two and two together pretty quickly. He’s glad that he gambled on Situ Ling. Once Situ Ling gets his hands on the Golden Millet Dream, he will be able to open the Swallow-Sky array during the next Qingyun tournament and rule over the six realms. But in the meantime, he tells his spy to find out who Ming Yi really is.  Oh Oh.  Is our warrior goddess about to be outed?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2jhx942xpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ce0415e6f40c9f4ca8f76a41abef444b3828bd2\n\n# Take me back to Wugui Sea…\n\nAs Ming Yi and her master pore over the recipe for the Golden Millet Dream, Bozai is suffering from the effects of the poison in Zhulong’s claws and falls like a sack of potatoes to the floor when Tianlin kicks him.\n\nI really like the interplay between Bozai, Ming Yi, and Tianlin here.  Tianlin is pretty much acting like a protective father finding faults with his daughter’s suitor. Ming Yi is playing the role of the clueless daughter who actually tries to suck the poison out of Bozai’s shoulder with his father…uh…master watching. Him flicking her forehead is comedic gold. And when he said he would handle it, I really thought he was going to suck the poison from Bozai himself.  Thank god he had a smarter way of getting rid of the poison.\n\nBozai of course milks his injury for all its worth and asks Ming Yi to take him back to Wugui Sea. He also spouts some trite romantic lines while Tianlin looked on in disgust.\n\n[\\\\\"牡丹花下死，做鬼也風流\\\\\"\\\\\"To die under a peony flower,  I will still be charming as a ghost.\\\\\" This proverb expresses the romantic desire to die in the company of a beautiful woman, symbolized by the peony. ](https://preview.redd.it/0wq8brq3xpwf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=622ab9cce07cc863dd93a962938e5ed3dcfafb2b)\n\nOnce they’re back in Wugui Sea, it’s more of the shameless Bozai.  However, when Bozai returns Ember to Ming Yi, their conversation takes a serious turn.\n\n[Ming Yi: “I dare not hope for a future”.  Bozai: “If I say there is a future, there will definitely be a future.” ](https://preview.redd.it/vk2hlyt8xpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad708d5f604ab788bce59450829d78a2f9148198)\n\nThere is that killer confidence again. But talk is cheap. I wonder why Bozai is not more concerned about Ming Yi’s health.  Does he not know that Ming Yi only has less than a month to live? And that the one of the main ingredients for the Golden Millet Dream, the core of the diwu tree, has been extinct for over ten thousand years?  Does he have a plan? (It turns out that he does…but more on that later.)\n\n# Situ Ling the Martyr\n\nAs Darth Vader would say. The martyrdom is strong with this one.\n\nWhen Ming Yi returns home from Wugui Sea, Situ Ling is there waiting for her, once again offering his unsolicited help. I can’t believe that I once thought him calling her *jie jie* cute. Now it just annoys the hell out of me.\n\nI liked that Ming Yi tried to set him straight about their relationship, or their lack of one. Too bad there is no hope of that sinking in.  She Tianlin tries to get rid of him (he is really like a mother hen, protecting her chicks..) but ends up telling him the crucial ingredient for the Golden Millet Dream instead. Oh why?  I hope this doesn’t come back to bite Ming Yi and Bozai later. How is Situ Ling planning on obtaining the full Golden Millet Dream recipe, I wonder.\n\n[\\\\\"Fate has run its course. We each have our own destiny.\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/xcu738rbxpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76542220d1c29089eaebd38ba60cde472efdf96d)\n\nIn either case, Situ Ling then comes up with the brilliant idea of using some kind of fox magic to prolong Ming Yi’s life.  It involves him somehow giving up his life force to replenish hers. At least his need to please Ming Yi prevented him from harming innocent lives for the spell. But god save me from another man who thinks they have the right to make decisions for a woman.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmucn0wdxpwf1.jpg?width=2441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e02dd890006c256151834bcd0d43ddf8dcabf2b3\n\nSitu Ling practically forces his hearts-blood down Ming Yi’s throat and then has the audacity to ask her for a promise? And Ming Yi should really know better than to give him false hope by sleeping by his bedside. That is only going to further enable his delusions.\n\nI have to give props to Situ Ling for trying to resist the temptation of the dark side.  But we all know it’s going to be futile.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d9nuz4rfxpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b98b1cfad73e8445e0cc9ca4e81f426549bb02b\n\n# Who cured Ming Yi?\n\nSo now Ming Yi finds herself not only alive and well, but her spiritual vein has grown back too!  Thanks to Situ Ling.\n\n[“Si…Situ Ling? ](https://preview.redd.it/b9ea7wpgxpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5481a0f523df94e3f5417d649cb90b91dc199537)\n\nWhen Ming Yi tells Bozai about how Situ Ling saved her, I thought that Bozai finally becomes jealous over Situ Ling for the first time.  Who would want their woman to drink another man’s blood? But it turns out that it’s a little more complicated than that. He’s actually the one who cured her by giving her the Golden Millet Dream!  After suffering through great pain and draining a huge amount of spiritual energy to refine it! And with his own poison not completely cured.… Ok.  In the interest of fairness, I have to judge him the same way I judged Situ Ling a little earlier.  Why won’t these men let a woman make her own decisions? And to throw his own words back at him.  Being honest is actually not that hard. Bozai only has himself to blame in this case. (Of course, I understand why he did it. But all these hiding stuff from each other is driving me nuts…)\n\nI have to say that Hou Ming Hao‘s acting was so on point here.  He conveyed a myriad of emotions in just few seconds…from happy to exasperation to just being a tad mad at having his credit taken away from him…\n\n# Tianji takes up the gaunlet\n\nIn other news, Tianji successfully ascends to the throne of Jixing Abyss, but promises to abdicate if they lose the next Qingyun tournament.\n\nSo off she goes to beg Ming Yi to help her team make some artifacts. Nice to see that Tianji has not changed a bit…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iv891g8qupwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9d5d2e0dd64cf636c8e247768d4a7527f540b9b\n\nAnd Ming Yi agrees, with the condition that she gets to attend the tea gathering that will be hosted by Yaoguan Mountain so she can find evidence that Ming Xin poisoned her. She will also have a chance to win a magical mushroom that may help refine companion animals, so that she can bring 27 back.\n\nBozai is worried that her identity may be exposed once people see the artifacts that she made for the Jixing Abyss team. But she tells him not to worry, because she doesn’t just make artifacts of Ember’s caliber just for anyone…Upon hearing that, Bozai looks like a cat that just ate the canary…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3w8b3aewvpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c0550aa06c5cef45ebad2da83c9abab594ec7a9\n\n# Buxiu mourns his friend\n\nAnd lastly, how sweet is it of Buxiu to mourn over Er Shi Qi?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9xv8inhwpwf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0af4e4eec9366a2d23beeb36b37a85e9a6d65036\n\nAnd there you have it. I really enjoyed these two episodes.  And both Hou Ming Hao and Lu Yu Xiao’s acting were so on point.  I can also just watch Ming Yi and her master bicker all day…\n\nSo what did you all think? sound off in the comments below.",

I’m back again with another C-drama character discussion 👋\n\nLike I promised, if my first post [Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/s/Bp7yXlXvu2) did well, I’d continue this little series — and honestly, the amazing responses and thoughtful comments from you all last time really motivated me to keep going. I loved reading the different perspectives and interpretations everyone had. It’s always fascinating how we can all watch the same drama yet come away with completely different takes on a character 😄\n\nSo, today’s topic is **Xie Wei (Xie Ju An)** from **The Story of Kunning Palace**\n\nNow, I’ve noticed that his character seems to divide opinions quite a bit — people either absolutely love him or can’t stand him at all 😅. Personally, I’m still not sure where I stand... But he is hailed as a complex character that’s why I wanted to open up this discussion — to hear what everyone else thinks about him.\n\nDo you think Xie Wei went through meaningful character development throughout the series?\n\nWas he a memorable or well-written character for you?\n\nAnd if he existed in real life, would you actually want to befriend or associate with someone like him?\n\n\nFeel free to go as deep as you want with your analysis — whether it’s about his psychology, morality, relationships, or role in the story. I’m genuinely curious to see how everyone interprets him and whether opinions have shifted after the drama ended.\n\n*Disclaimer: This post is purely about the character Xie Wei, not the actor Zhang Linghe💬*",

    "content": "I really liked the show and I especially loved the chemistry between the leads!!! The immortal realm was my favorite, since it was filled with romance and humor. I personally like the FL most during this arc, bc I liked seeing how lazy and silly she was. It was also great seeing their love last through 3 lifetimes (my fav xianxia trope lol).\n\n**Some slight complaints:**\n\nThe lore regarding spirit fire, new sources of spirit fire, as well as merging them together came across confusing to me (some of it made sense but some didn't). It's most likely my lack of understanding, and even though I've watched a lot of xianxia, it's my first time seeing spirit fire being a central part of the story. \n\nIt's not really a problem, but I thought the demon realm arc was somewhat draggy. However, I liked seeing the friendship between Hongluo and A'Yan as well as the FL's serious fighter side. It was also nice seeing love between the leads develop despite her not having memory of him. Maybe my recollection is wrong, but there wasn't much action or group adventure UNTIL they went on the illusory vacation where the ML almost dies (end of the arc).\n\nThe second leads (Ye Ruling/Hongluo + Hei Nianjiu) have good chemistry but imo they don't really have screen time together towards the middle and end (demon and mortal realms). Their relationship is mentioned here and there but there's not much development. It would've been interesting to see more chemistry btwn them. Also, their endings were inconclusive (we never got a final scene of them together). \n\nThat being said, I was also hoping to see Hongluo recover her memories, bc her past mission as Ruling was to lead her demon clan back to their realm. Though it technically did end up being accomplished, I wanted to see the aftermath. I thought it would've been more important to the story since it was mentioned a lot in the beginning.\n\n**Some questions:**\n\n1. Does anyone else wish the mortal realm were longer? I felt quite an imbalance since the immortal and demon realm arcs are twice the length. Plus, the wedding and other events in the last ep felt rushed.\n2. Why is the Sima clan mainly responsible for guarding the spirit fire, when other members of the Fengshan clan are able to do so as well? And how were the separate spirit fires created? (I believe these details were explained, I just don't remember clearly).\n3. How did Sima Jiao transmigrate to the modern world? Also, did he remember the FL? It seems like he did judging from his mannerisms, but he also said \"Have we met before?\".",

    "content": "So, it’s my first time hosting. I’m open to feedback. thank you.\n\nThe scene starts with the Shadow Guards pledging their loyalty to their Kui; Su Mu Yu.\n\nThis scene is interesting because it clearly shows that everyone desires a new Anhe.\n\n# A Chess Game\n\nIn order to deepen the feud between the three families, Mu Bai, the son of the Mu family head, is killed and his death is pinned on the Su family.\n\nThe same ploy is at play with Xie Fanghua (the sickly guy)’s death being pinned on the Su family.\n\nThese schemes really make me wonder what Su Changhe is up to. It seems people from both families are working for him to cause more chaos in Anhe.\n\nBut what does he gain from it?\n\nSo far, it seems Su Changhe is playing a chess game with everyone, but I can’t prove it.\n\n[Su Changhe and his antics.](https://preview.redd.it/8ytnry31eowf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba650e63e73c214731b6161c4f218365980ce927)\n\nWith the death of important family members in the Xie and Mu families, each of them decides to play their ace cards—bringing in more powerful and deadlier assassins into their families.\n\nXie Qidao from the Xie family, an assassin trainer (Xie Buxie’s master), and Mu Ciling, a crazy assassin who is locked in a coffin for years, are our newest additions to the large family.\n\n# The Patriarch’s Recovery\n\nFinally, our young miracle physician is able to cure the Patriarch’s poison, but it doesn’t come easily as it requires someone else to draw the poison onto themselves.\n\nUnfortunately, Mu Kewen, the old man with the hunchback who guards Spider’s Nest all his life, gives up his life to save the Patriarch.\n\nWith this news, we see an emotional reaction from the Patriarch, and I sense there’s a deep history between the two old men.\n\n[Can we talk about how good this actor is in portraying the Patriarch? I love seeing him on my screen.](https://preview.redd.it/9gpqm387eowf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66c118128ec61e01cad603ecf3c5da6f4370ebef)\n\nWhile leaving the Spider’s Nest to probably live out the rest of his life away from Anhe’s conflicts, Mu Kewen hopes Su Changhe and Su Mu Yu won’t end up like him and the Patriarch.\n\nIs this foreshadowing?\n\n# Su Mu Yu x Su Changhe\n\nA short flashback shows how Su Mu Yu and Su Changhe defy the long-standing rule of Anhe and how the current Patriarch saves their lives.\n\nThis explains why Su Mu Yu is really firm in his decision to protect the Patriarch in spite of how everyone around him expects him to make a different choice.\n\n[I really enjoy the way they care about each other. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0qyw57vfowf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cbb9d0512cf5b50c005e57dcde5472f3ed4ba75)\n\nSo it’s all about repaying debt.\n\nSu Mu Yu’s background as a sect member/martial artist is really shining through in these episodes because things like repaying debt and loyalty belong to the martial art sects, not an assassin sect.\n\nIt’s tough to be different.\n\n# The Patriarch’s Proposal\n\nSu Mu Yu goes to the Su family’s hideout in Juxiao City with the Patriarch’s proposal.\n\nHe delivers the Dormant Dragon Sword to the Su family head with the condition that he, Su Changhe, and a few people can choose to leave Anhe forever.\n\n# Mu Ciling (Half-human/Half-monster)\n\nWhile they deliberate on taking the sword, the Mu family delivers a special surprise locked in a Death Coffin to their door.\n\nMu Ciling, one of the newest characters, shows up interestingly, looking totally unhinged.\n\n[I like Mu Ciling already. I do have a soft spot for crazy characters that practice forbidden techniques. ](https://preview.redd.it/qttd3h9oeowf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e4dc4a866dd61a26541e30523f6cb744cf545bd)\n\nMu Ciling fights to steal the sword in exchange for a poison antidote from the Mu family head.\n\nApparently, Mu Ciling is one of the few formidable assassins of Anhe. To seal him in the Death Coffin, it takes the three family heads’ joint action.\n\nBut between him and just one family head, who will win in a fight?\n\nTwo members of the Su family try to fight him off but are easily defeated.\n\nLeft with no choice, the Su family head engages in a face-off with him.\n\nAn interesting battle between a seasoned assassin and family head with 40 years of experience and an unhinged assassin who has mastered a forbidden technique and slept in a Death Coffin for years.\n\nIt’s hard to choose who to bet on, to be honest.\n\nTheir fighting sequence is actually one of the most interesting I’ve seen since I started the drama.\n\nThe fight ends in a draw and Mu Ciling successfully escapes with the Dormant Dragon Sword.\n\nXie Qidao follows him in suit, where they fight in the street.\n\n# Bai He Huai\n\nHere, Bai Ye Huai, our cute physician, grabs the sword and creates a poison array to prevent the duo assassins from taking it back.\n\nUnfortunately, her array doesn’t last long, so she trades the sword for her life. Smart move, I must say.\n\n[our meddling Water Official. He looks young, though. I wonder how he got the position.  ](https://preview.redd.it/m2eguz2efowf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f19254098ec2b188cefaec51260278b284d30b5)\n\nDuring the conflict, we see a very cute character, Water Official, one of the three officials who are integral to Anhe’s operations and existence.\n\nHe attempts to steal the sword discreetly, but something seems amiss, so he lets go of it.\n\nDuring the chaos, the Mu family head sneakily kills one of the Shadow Guards, a scene Su Mu Yu arrives at a little too late.\n\nIn the same frame, Mu Ciling threatens to murder another colleague of Su Mu Yu in exchange for the sword, and we watch him feel conflicted. Will he choose his subordinate or the sword?\n\nFortunately, he chooses his subordinate while Mu Ciling delivers the sword to the Mu family head, who proclaims himself as the new Patriarch.\n\nAs expected, the Xie family arrives to claim the sword for themselves.\n\n# Water Official x Patriarch\n\nThe Water Official visits the Patriarch and realizes that the sword everyone has been fighting over for the past couple of hours is fake. The real sword lies with the Patriarch.\n\nThat’s a brilliant scheme to get the wolves off your back.\n\nIn his conversation with the Patriarch, he finds out that the old man has already created a Homeland—a safe space for people who want to leave Anhe.\n\n# So,\n\nHow do you like the progress so far?\n\nWhat’s your favorite part of the two episodes?",

It is living rent-free in my head. And in my cloud drive (unfortunately, not rent free).\n\nSuige is a gorgeous man, but Suige + robe is blinding me. Put the two of them together and I find myself losing track of what the plot is all about. And apparently, Chen Zheyuan's studio thought the same because they shared this recently:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1od57me/video/bk4sjpdaxmwf1/player\n\n# Much-awaited reunion\n\nXiyang meets her brother at last. It's so sad because she obviously feels such great shame for what she did, so full of regret, knowing that her actions led to a lot of problems for her family.\n\nShe knew that she never appreciated what she had until she lost it completely, but I think the most heartbreaking thing about this scene was the fact that she felt like she's no longer pure, that she's a ruined or fallen woman. And now that she has the emperor's child, the situation is even worse; logically she won't be allowed to leave Jinxiu, despite what the emperor says. (Though I think he was sincere to let her go.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5nejj6d0u1wf1.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fd06b633e1d3af0ed0e9b6c99b8938fa877bbb4\n\nSuige's expression during this time was heartbreaking. It's more the fact that his sister suffered so much, not because she lost her purity in any way. But his eyes tell that he wants Jingshi and Jingyang dead.\n\n# Weiran bumps into Ning Fei and Yixiao.\n\nDoes he feel regret or sadness for the way things became between all of them? Who knows? You know what I think? He is as expressionless as his master. I think it is infectious! Prolonged contact with Jingshi will result in the inability to move your facial muscles.\n\nAnyway, they now declare they are enemies and stuff. Alrighty.\n\n# Kill Count #4: The emperor of Jinxiu\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ek6tg4fsu1wf1.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f2830b8ab49832343a8ec895145d007701cc5ed\n\nDamn it, Show! I never expected to semi-cry for this man; a man who probably brutalized more people than we think, but that scene where he died beside Xiyang was heartbreaking because for the first time in his life he actually let go of his ego to beg for a person's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Jingshi demonstrates that he is an irredeemable bastard. The Show likes to juxtapose Suige and Jingshi a lot, and I noticed that unlike Suige, who literally cried in agony when he killed Murong Yao, Jingshi looks like he's having a high. Euw.\n\nBut to me, it is unforgiveable that he plunged he killed an unborn child (like what else is new, I suppose, master of death camps) and harmed a pregnant woman.\n\nSuige finding his dying sister propels him to nuclear-level rage. You thought he was *mad* at Murong Yao? Man, Jingshi doesn't know what's coming.\n\n# Thoughts about this arc\n\nDespite the gorgeousness of the robe, I think that this arc is probably the weakest of the series. Yes, not the Alliance arc, but this one. (To me, that is. I know some of you won't agree :P) The logic wobbled in this arc. For one, Suige is just walking around a former-enemy's territory without being shadowed? He is staying in an inn? If that inn is the HQ of his spies, won't he be outing them? (I tried not to think *too deeply* about it, but it did bug me a tad :P. Just felt that Jinxiu's security is rather lax and loosey-goosey. Sure, they are *former* enemies, but I found it odd that royal protocol was so ... informal in Jinxiu?\n\nI'm also puzzled why the emperor let Xiyang go. I know that he loves her, but it seemed improbably to me, since we've seen how selfish and narcisstic he can be.\n\n**Questions**\n\nDid you feel sad when the emperor of Jinxiu died?\n\nWhat do you think of this arc?",

I started watching WDBTD because of all the hype and the rumoured kissing scenes (👀). \n\nI'm on episode 9 at the moment and I really don't like the FL😭 She's seems too naive and too dumb for my liking which is understandable given she was thrown into a completely different universe she didn't ask for when all she wanted was a holiday but her entire personality and vibe seems one dimensional to me. Not to mention she doesn't add anything to the story at the moment besides being Sima Jiao's plus one to kill his time. Honestly her scenes with the ML feel like filler scenes to me because most of the plot and important bits always happen without her being involved😭 Even when she is, she's being used as a pawn always threatend with death only to be saved by Sima Jiao over and over again.\n\nDoes she get stronger/smarter/wiser in the upcoming episodes? Because her being a cute damsel in distress all the time is getting tiring😭. \n\nI really wanna like this show because I'm enjoying the plot and loving Sima Jiao and Nianjiu and Ruling. But I'm not sure about the FL for now...\n\nAlso no shade to the actors or the show itself, its an amazing production so far all in all.",

Writing often helps with closure, so here's something that's... not quite a review, but more like a reflection.\n\nWhen a drama allows me to empathize with the people who lived in another time, under an ideology vastly different from my own, I already consider it a success. When it goes further and stirs the wish to understand that era, to feel the pulse of its people, then it becomes something truly rare. And **Silent Honor** succeeded on both fronts.\n\nAt first, my experience with the drama wasn't exactly that great (and you can read my first impressions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nvn3k3/comment/nhavfxg/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)). The quality felt uneven, and I couldn’t quite grasp the main characters’ motivations. But as I learned more about the historical context, the main characters' choices and actions began to make sense, and I began to see them differently. I went from seeing their actions as unusually driven by emotions, to realizing that their “weaknesses” were exactly what made them human. Even knowing how their story would end (&gt;!in deaths!&lt;), I still found myself bracing through every episode, willingly \"accompanying\" them in their final months: it’s one of the most heavy, anxiety-inducing, yet hauntingly moving stories I’ve seen this year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy8m2ivykkwf1.png?width=3248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3c218ba9422c1dab828d60cdc9a500cb03e7ee7\n\nThe title, **Silent Honor**, which I once thought sounded too formal and traditional, now feels perfectly fitting. Unlike most espionage dramas, there are no all-powerful agents, no miraculous turnarounds, no flashy action scenes. The protagonists are ordinary people: flawed, constrained, being constantly watched and suspected and with nowhere to run. Yet they never wavered from their goals, and always put others before themselves. The show doesn’t dramatize suffering or torture for effect or sympathy, and it also resists heavy-handed moralizing. It simply unfolds quietly, and steadily, until these historical figures settled deeply into my heart.\n\n# And they are...\n\n[\\(L to R\\) Nie Xi, Zhu Feng and Wu Shi, core members of the East Sea Team](https://preview.redd.it/26v9odsbakwf1.png?width=4833&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be3d337fc2413c6a05ed721ae077b2a0b8a3ff92)\n\n# Wu Shi (吴石) — played by Yu Hewei\n\n&gt;虽千万人吾往矣  \nThough thousands stand against me, I will forge forward.\n\nYu Hewei once delivered this same line as *Chen Duxiu* in **The Age of Awakening**. Then, it was passionate and defiant. But when he speaks it again as *Wu Shi* in **Silent Honor**, after being captured, it carries a completely different weight. It’s calm, resolute, and quietly proud. It even makes you wonder: did *Wu* truly lose, or was this another form of victory?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6myo8w8dkwf1.png?width=4400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa349b05d3eb8cbc4217a146c19a3a5be246fb91\n\nYu Hewei’s performance in **Silent Honor** moved me deeply. Throughout the series, he remains composed and understated. He doesn’t rely on emotional outbursts, but instead conveys this introspective, 儒将 (scholar-general) temperament through restraint and nuance. \n\n[Wu Shi spending a peaceful moment with his wife \\(on a rare evening where he didn't have to work overtime XD](https://preview.redd.it/okzqbou8ekwf1.png?width=4400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cfc8e86522da24ee51baf3d8b21031d2476187d)\n\nYu's voice was soft yet unwavering, his presence grounded. He looks at his wife with quiet affection, endures his daughter’s misunderstandings without complaint, and when faced with the deaths of his comrades, his grief comes silently, without sound or spectacle.\n\n[Wu Shi walking down a busy, festive street in sadness](https://preview.redd.it/wzferfqddkwf1.png?width=4400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=721ad359a00f7ef73ac80c9df6b5dd6b86596ebb)\n\nUnlike his fiery and outspoken *Chen Duxiu*, or his bold and commanding *Cao Cao*, *Wu Shi* lives up to his name: steady as stone in his convictions, yet gentle and luminous in his humanity.\n\n[One of the many touching and inspiring scenes with Wu Shi was where he went to meet a friend that had misunderstood Wu Shi's beliefs. These simple lines really captured the kindred spirit and bond between the two.](https://i.redd.it/8wlwxu0vekwf1.gif)\n\nBecause of this deep connectedness and care I developed for the main character, I thought I wouldn’t be able to bear watching his interrogation scenes after the arrest, but those final episodes became his most powerful moments. It felt as if he had long accepted his fate and met it with complete calm. There’s even a strange sense of relief, almost quiet satisfaction, in the way he faces the end—no anger, no despair. The perfect embodiment of 虽败犹荣: a dignity so profound it turns defeat into a form of honor.\n\n\n\n# Zhu Feng (朱枫) -- played by Wu Yue\n\n&gt;I can assure you, that if I am exposed one day, I will sacrifice my life to protect the East Sea Team.\n\nOther than Uncle Yu, actress Wu Yue's *Zhu Feng* was the character that made me stay with the drama before the story itself had fully clicked. Portrayed by Wu Yue with remarkable restraint and warmth, *Zhu Feng* stands out as both intelligent and dignified, a woman who observes keenly, communicates with grace, and carries a calm strength beneath her gentle exterior.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xasrhwwhekwf1.png?width=4400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd8fc4617ae65d41f219af903ec4e64b8b10c857\n\nThough she only appears in a limited number of scenes early on, Wu Yue paints *Zhu Feng* vividly with just a few strokes. As a liaison who was hastily trained and thrust into danger, she makes mistakes, but her courage and composure never faltered. I especially loved the recurring image of her watering flowers by the window, bathed in soft light. Those quiet moments carry a serenity and a gentle, maternal warmth that say so much about who she is.\n\nI also appreciated that the show gave space to her role as a mother. She comes across as unpretentious, sincere, and deeply empathetic. I found myself genuinely hoping that her kindness and care would reach those hardened by circumstance, like her son-in-law —&gt;! and in the end, I think she did, perhaps to her own surprise!&lt;.\n\nHer friendship with *Mrs. Wu* was another highlight for me. Although *Zhu Feng* first approached her with a mission in mind, what grew between them were heartfelt and mutual. That final farewell scene hits especially hard when you realize it’s also a permanent goodbye.\n\n[Zhu Feng visiting Mrs. Wu \\(Bikui\\) as she leaves to Hong Kong, and they share a hug and exchange good byes](https://i.redd.it/7bfqnfxhfkwf1.gif)\n\nFrom her stubborn choice to stay behind, to her unflinching calm in captivity, to the courage it took to end her own life (&gt;!twice!!!&lt;) rather than betray others, *Zhu Feng*'s every act reflects not just bravery but clarity of purpose, and  Wu Yue’s portrayal gives her that rare balance of humanity, grace, and heroism. Her last, faint smile lingers long after the story ends.\n\n[Zhu Feng when she first visited the Wu family as a guest and friend of Mrs. Wu and joining them for a family meal \\(Upper Left clockwise from the middle we have Wu Shi, Bikui \\(Mrs. Wu\\), their daughter \\(Xuecheng\\), Nie Xi \\(might as well be Wu's son XD\\) and Zhu Feng. Also picked this photo cos of the food of course :D](https://preview.redd.it/g6vu8umrfkwf1.png?width=4264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0363629effd29cc63692f3cf04dbeaef19c06964)\n\n# Nie Xi (聂曦) — played by Wei Chen\n\n&gt;If you don't agree to take me with you to Taiwan, I’ll come find you even if I have to swim across the strait!\n\nUnlike Yu Hewei or Wu Yue, I had no expectations for Wei Chen. I didn’t know his previous work and was honestly skeptical when I saw that a \"new face\" has been cast in such an important role. After finishing the drama, I still wouldn’t say his performance was extraordinary in a technical sense. And knowing what the real *Nie Xi* looked like: an older, composed colonel serving as Lieutenant General *Wu Shi*’s assistant, I am not sure that this casting fit that image. Wei Chen looked too young (though surprisingly he’s 39), which changed the dynamic between the two men such that the relationship felt more like that of a devoted younger student and a respected teacher.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8dupnyrgkwf1.png?width=4400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a96b60be61a08762f4dacb4d5cad57b5cb5196c6\n\nBut once I accepted that creative choice, the \"younger version\" of *Nie Xi* actually worked. Wei Chen’s portrayal captured something quietly compelling: a blend of youthful sincerity and restrained passion, and his earnest gaze and unwavering loyalty to both the Party and his mentor became the heart of his character. He’s one of those people who earn your respect gradually, through small moments of conviction and warmth rather than grand gestures.\n\nWhen he's with *Wu Shi*, *Nie Xi* carries the energy of a student eager to learn and afraid to disappoint. He’s respectful, slightly awkward at times, and not always confident, yet you can see his wit and initiative shining through. He’s quick to learn, owns up to mistakes, and his sharp instincts often help defuse suspicion around his mentor. When danger strikes, he’s always the first to step forward: impulsive, but never reckless in spirit.\n\n[Nie Xi out on a mission to retrieve some information. Can you spot the Secret Service agents that are trailing him?](https://preview.redd.it/ukjl381ygkwf1.png?width=4264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cc152ee49169c163e7ccc4a609f319046633d63)\n\nA few scenes of *Nie Xi* really stayed with me: the steady determination in his eyes when sending the final telegraph, his tearful reunion with *Wu Shi*&gt;! after Wu was released from house arrest!&lt;, and that heartbreaking farewell with his wife after his capture. &gt;!If *Wu Sh*i’s final meeting with his wife was filled with gentle love meant to comfort, *Nie Xi*’s was more of an attempt to help his wife move on by severing emotional ties!&lt;. It was painful, but deeply selfless.\n\n*Nie Xi* embodies a kind of pure, idealistic loyalty that feels both moving and tragic. By the end, his story feels like a quiet echo of sacrifice: the kind that comes not from glory, but from love and belief.\n\n[Yes, Nie Xi gets a hug scene gif too :D](https://i.redd.it/n4zxthn0hkwf1.gif)\n\n# How to Craft an Ending\n\nIn episode 1 of the series, a friend comes to deliver the Party’s non-mandatory mission while gently advising *Wu Shi* that he doesn’t need to risk going to Taiwan. Sitting at the dinner table, *Wu Shi* simply smiles and says:\n\n&gt;若一去不回，便一去不回  \nIf this should be a path of no return, then let me walk the path of no return.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7p3qdohlhkwf1.gif\n\nRevisiting this line at the end of the series, after witnessing every decision, step, and farewell of the East Sea Team, it begins to take on a deeper weight, resonating as a quiet testament to the courage, resolve, and steadfast beliefs behind each member’s choices.\n\nI’m grateful to the production team and casts for bringing this story to life. In a time when so many series end disappointingly, this one, and despite its known tragic outcome, managed to deliver a finale that is tragic yet never hopeless. It elevates the story, gives the characters’ sacrifices weight and meaning, and leaves me reflecting in respect.\n\n&gt;俯仰不愧天地，褒貶自有春秋  \nBefore Heaven and Earth I shall stand with no shame;  \nPraise or criticism, history will be my judge.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5bt1hgllkwf1.png?width=4400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e4120619b49b8b671f62a2b09687d0ae7fadd65\n\n",

I adored the brief glimpses of the guy I called Hot Umbrella Assassin and was ecstatic when they said they'd make a drama out of his story. I refrained from watching the anime because I didn't want to suffer from comparititis and just enjoy the drama as it is.\n\n(Random thought, I'm super glad they stuck with the \"Blood\" theme and called this show, \"Blood River\". The English department did a good job and refrained from using Blossom, though Blood Blossom does have this snappy aliteration thing going :P)\n\nSo the whole point of the first six episodes is:\n\n# Let's kill the patriach!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9twrbhsyigwf1.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7275626df1223320861ecfd836454142e765838\n\nThe Patriach of Dark River is severely poisoned during a mission. This presents a golden opportunity for the three major families: Su, Xie, and Mu, who all want to seize the \"Dragon Sword\". In this world, swords are super duper important, and whoever who owns the sword will be Patriarch.\n\nSu Muyu escorts him to Qiantang City to find the famous doctor, Bai Hehuai. However, the Xie and Mu families are also lying in wait, aiming to kill the doctor and end the Patriarch's life.\n\n# The Families: A tangled web of hatred\n\nThe Su, Mu and Xie families are more \"mafia families\" than \"we'll have a nice Chinese New Year with relatives you barely tolerate\" kind of family, if you know what I mean.\n\nSeriously, with all their talk about family ... with family like this who needs enemies? Man, better to divorce your family and be orphans. Bet it's a less anxiety-provoking life!\n\nAnyway, with the vicious way children were trained to be assassins in Blood River, is it any wonder they hate each other's guts? Or is it a Darwinian selection thing - only the coldest, most heartless would survive?\n\nSo, with the the Patriarch weakened, it's unsurprising why a free-for-all to become the next ruler.\n\nInexplicably, though, Su Muyu is different. He is loyal to the patriarch. Something Su Changhe, his best bud, doesn't understand.\n\n[Their Gaokao is on another level](https://preview.redd.it/izyzflvejgwf1.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21bc34a4f9bfc63472718153b8445b5825c38169)\n\nNeither do I. Seeing the way they had to endure near-death \"training\" just to survive to adulthood, I wonder why myself. It's not like the Patriach was benevolent to him.\n\nUnfortunately, Muyu's loyalty puts him at odds with his best bud, who really wants the Patriarch dead.\n\nWhy won't Muyu choose \"brotherhood\"? why is he so intent on  \"duty/loyalty?\" I guess we'll find out!\n\n[It's so nice to see this pagoda again! In Blood of Youth, Sword Deity Li Hanyi split it in half, and we even see her briefly here.](https://preview.redd.it/za9ezk53ogwf1.png?width=1476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ee2eb2791da36cec44d29cdf107c88aefad5990)\n\n# Is there romance?\n\nYou know, if anyone asks that question, I say there are sparks between Mu Yumo and Tang Lianyue. They are attracted to each other but are on opposing sides. But don't expect it to end well. There's a maaaaaybe between Muyu and the Miracle Doc Baihe, But Muyu is one of those career men who focuses on his work, if you know I mean.\n\nAlso, it's a wuxia (more like xuanhuan with wuxia characteristics). Romance is just a dash of jam on a peanut butter sandwich. Sometimes the jam slips off to one corner of the sandwich and you don't taste it until the very end. So, let's not hope too much.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ymzvk0ywogwf1.gif\n\n# Su Muyu, a nice guy trapped in a scary organisation?\n\nIn these first four episodes, Su Muyu's goal is very clear: to faithfully carry out the Patriarch's order and ensure his survival by any means necessary.\n\nMe: **But why??**\n\nI guess it may have something to do with his humanity, which Dark River never managed to stomp out.\n\nWe see how he saved Su Changhe when they were young. Now, he is forced to fight his former comrades but is often reluctant to kill. He also seem to have a life with a loving dad before he was one of the kids fighting for his life thanks to Dark River training.\n\nSu Muyu still values life and old bonds, which is probably not a great idea in a sect full of assassins.\n\n# Uncle Zhe finds his daughter\n\n[Don't mind us! We're having a family reunion.](https://preview.redd.it/7zeuicckkgwf1.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcde3cc66cbab9f99e0ae12e054a7cf7a9ecae2)\n\nAw, such a sweet moment when Uncle Zhe reunites with his long-lost daughter, who turns out to be our miracle doctor, Bai Hehuai.\n\nI found it hilarious that the bad guys waited so nicely for them to finish talking before attacking ;P\n\nAnyway, we find out that Bai Hehuai was his daughter when she tried to perform the dangerous Soul Separation Technique to heal the poisoned and dying Patriach, and she sees his past memory. And then she reveals a technique that only the Su family knows. During the battle, Uncle Zhe recognises the moves as the very one he taught his wife. Yay, reunion.\n\nUncle Zhe please be a good guy. Don't switch sides just because you think you can use your daughter to get close to the patriach or something.  ;(((\n\n# Are we the bad guys?\n\n[I don't know lemme think](https://i.redd.it/eutqzlcdlgwf1.gif)\n\nInteresting conversation at the end of the sixth episode. For the first time, I'm feeling some kind of emotional theme here - it sucks to be the bad guys, and some Dark River members see hope in Su Muyu, that he could turn them from a bloodthirsty mercenaries to a sect with some honour. Thus solidifies Su Muyu's mission: To reform Dark River.\n\n# Fight after Fight after Fight\n\n[This fight is kewl tho](https://i.redd.it/s2pft8a0ngwf1.gif)\n\nSo, I'll confess something to you. The fights are a blur to me. :P\n\nIt's made worse by the fact that the fights are of the \"finger fu\" variety where they do a few twirls, wave their hands around and magical things erupt around them. Still, it's very inline with this genre - it always tickles me that they \"announce\" the person's skill level or fighting technique, or they monologue and explain what movement they're using. It's hella weird to me, but I know fans of this genre simply love it.\n\nAnyway, while some of the fight scenes were beautiful to look at, but there was a deluge of them.\n\nI feel like they didn't give the story or characters time to breathe. Before we get to know any of them, they're either hurling swords at each other or dying :P (Oh white guy in that floating sedan - who are you again and what family?? Oh wait, didn't *he die?*) Yeah, it's just a blur to me lol\n\nWe don't know anything about their motivations except they want the Patriach to die. Heck we don't even know why Muyu *doesn't want* the Patriach to die 😆\n\nAnd with the deluge of characters coming at me, I think I need an AI-powered knowledge base to figure my way around 😆\n\nSo, forgive this old lady if she gets names or fights mixed up because each time a fight scene happens she's thinking:\n\n[Who ARE these people again?](https://preview.redd.it/gl97dvyehgwf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eebe635c91d207dea368f90cfb182456b00c4866)\n\n# Questions\n\n* Which relationship intrigues you?\n* Why do you think Su Muyu is loyal to the patriach?\n* So, Su Muyu is tasked with helping reform Dark River. How do you think he can possibly achieve this?\n* What do you think of the acting, fighting scenes, CGI of the show?\n* What do you think of the drama so far?",

    "content": "Just finished watching all 32 episodes of the show. \n\nSort of a bittersweet ending. Everything is a dream of the FL who fell while chasing after the mysterious man in black in the first episode. While in the past, Lin Yan died alone with only him remembering the Shen family, and with his sheer memories and perseverance, he managed to construct the restaurant and menu.\n\nThe mysterious man in black is somehow the present day incarnation of Lin Yan, who coincidentally, has the same dream as the FL, and they ended up together.\n\nAnother sad ending is that Pei did not end up with the princess, despite both of them loving each other. \n\nOf note, I love episode 30 the most, as I feel Li Yunrui’s acting was superb here as he dealt with his foster father…",

I've definitely experienced both. That said, ratings can be helpful as a general reference for what others think.\n\nI am sharing this information for folks who are curious about Douban scores but may not be able to access them quickly or easily. I have also included viewership data since Douban scores don't always correlate with a drama's popularity with the broader domestic audience.\n\nThis is just a small snapshot of how Douban users are rating dramas and what’s currently being watched in China.\n\nSome people use ratings to gauge interest while others don't. It's up to them. I'm providing these numbers for those who are interested.\n\nI usually post these every few weeks when there are enough new scores from Douban for a compilation.\n\n***\n\nFor those of you who have watched these dramas, what do you think of the scores?\n\n",

But not Xiyang. Understandable, because that means that she's even more trapped in her situation. Not only does she not love the emperor, having his son means that she's even more deeply entangled. Still, it is sweet how the emperor reacted when he found she was making an ointment for him.\n\nBut because she finds out that her brother is still alive, she's even more determined to go back home so there's no chance she wants to be with the emperor.\n\nEmperor looks unhappy by that. I kinda feel unhappy too, eventhough  logically, I know that a narcissist  cannot truly  love,but sometimes  I have doubts with the emperor.\n\n# Kill Count 3: Murong Yao\n\n[That was quick](https://preview.redd.it/odkktfnmp1wf1.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18a341df8e1a62d6550274b66da6da7f0b5a12dc)\n\nAgain, Suige fights fair. He is as ruthless with his enemies as always; he displays the Marquis' body the way they displayed the emperor's body before. He forces his former best friend to relive the moment he discovered his father's dead body. Brutal. Though,  logically it was Murong  Sr's idea  to display the body  like that.\n\n[How does karma taste, Murong Yao?](https://preview.redd.it/vw15cqgup1wf1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f75ba729ff7b95b2af78d519749bcd019777dbe)\n\nBut unlike Murong Yao, Suige doesn't attack from behind; he decides to fight face-to-face with Murong Yao with his fists because this time it is *super personal.* (Also, I doubt he likes the coward's way of stabbing people in the back.)\n\nHe fights face to face with the cosplaying general who stabbed him in the back, and we see that Murong Yao is simply no match for Suige.\n\nIn fact, I thought it was absolutely stupid that Murong Yao thought he could march around as the head of the imperial guards when he can't even swing a sword or a fist decently.\n\nRemember when the Marquis begged Suige to not kill his son? Well, yeah, Suige kills him in front of his dead body anyway. Vicious. I suppose the  only mercy he gave the Marquis is that he gets to not  see it alive.\n\nAnd like Suige in ep 28, Murong Yao collapses next to the dead body of his father, reaping the full consequences of his actions.\n\nStill, anyone of you think that he died *too easily?* I mean, dang, Suige was stabbed multiple and buried alive but our boy here was punched (very, very hard, admittedly) a few times and he's gone. Despite his ambitions or dream to  be a general like his dad, he's simply not hardy  enough for  the role - mentally and physically.\n\nStill found it eye rolling that he thought he was some kind of big shot villain, and how he *thought* just by saying that his father would not be implicated or affected. That's not how things worked in ancient China, Murong Yao.\n\nTo  his credit, MY did cry a little for  Suige unlike  his dad, so at least there's some kind of  humanity  left in him, but not enough to make him repent. As we all know, he was back on the  \"I want to  kill Suige\" train  pretty quickly after  he found  out  that Suige  was alive.\n\nBut judging from that cry after killing him, Suige did not enjoy it; he really did love the Murongs. I believe he did it not for his own satisfaction but because his men needed to be avenged.\n\nLike he explained to Murong Sr before - how can he explain things to his men if he let Murong Yao go? So many people had died during the Battle of Pingling, and also when they tried to rush him to safety in episode 28.\n\nHis men needed justice and he delivered.",

She was determined to protect the peace of her country as her mission.\n\nDuring her military service, she reunited with Zhang Xing Jian, whom she had known in the past. Zhang Xing Jian was a civil servant of the dynasty. He entered the game and fought against the treacherous.

If they can obtain both parts of the famed medical text, they will be able to produce the Golden Millet Dream. They know that Hanfeng used Part 1 to produce the Heavenly Grief in the Sunken Abyss, so that must be where Part 1 is. As for Part 2, when the six realms raided the Bo sister’s home on Zhangwei Mountain, their ancestral home was sealed by their patron deity Zhulong. Since no one has been able to find Part 2, Fuyue reasoned, Part 2 must still be hidden somewhere inside the Bo residence.\n\nSo off to the Sunken Abyss Ming Yi goes, except she didn’t get too far. Her weakened state causes her to faint in the forest, where she is found by Bozai. I guess the guy just can’t help himself. Even when he thinks he’s been betrayed, he still comes running as soon as Zhang Tai informs him that Ming Yi is missing.\n\nOh, and Situ Ling was looking for her too. But without a hero halo of course he got beat by the other guy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5un8nlkzlewf1.jpg?width=2415&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a6f57842849bab08fc3d1b27491bd1966efd26c\n\nBozai takes Ming Yi to an abandoned house, injects some spiritual energy into her, and I find myself screaming “Look at her arm!” But of course TV gods don’t hear my plea, and Ji Bozai instead grills her on why she removed the part about the upper realms being involved in the raising of the netherbeasts from Xinliu’s testimonial. He wonders if Ming Yi already has the list of people who are involved, which Ming Yi denies. Ming Yi does, however, inadvertently discloses that Ming Xian has contracted the Heavenly Grief.  Great. So now Bozai thinks she only got together with him to save Ming Xian. I swear, this girl has the knack for putting her foot in her mouth like no other.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j844w3m4newf1.jpg?width=2422&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed5ee3bf101939ee8dee005c7b45e08c59f6bcce\n\n# Search for the Bo Medical Classics, Take Two\n\nIn today’s episode of The Amazing Race, teams converge upon the Sunken Abyss to look for Part 1 of the Bo Medical Classics.\n\nTeam #1: Chao Xuan and Chao An, 2nd and 3rd prince of the Zhuoshui Spiritual State. They are aware that removing the medical text will cause the Sunken Abyss to collapse and release miasma into the divine capital. So their goal is to annihilate the Jixing Abyss once for all, except they didn’t count on their little brother, who will stop at nothing to protect his lifelong obsession. When Prince/Canon Fodder #2 isn’t looking, Situ Ling channels his inner Cain and pulverizes Chao Xuan to take possession of the medical text and gives it to She Tian Lin.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nqtf2howlewf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=445563658eecc50f0e132b7064e3380c01a6b298\n\nTeam #2: Ming Yi and her master She Tian Lin. After splitting up with her master, Ming Yi was discovered by Chao An, who tries to kill her. Luckily, Bozai arrives in the nick of time to save her. Situ Ling also gets there, and together, the love rivals defeat and kill Chao An.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h81sa1evlewf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5796ec5a4b7364eeaf72a366263b364ba50e98dd\n\nWith the Sunken Abyss now on the verge of collapse, Bozai whisks Ming Yi away and the two goes on a joyride on the back of Bozai’s pet dragon and engage in some illuminating conversation:\n\n[Bozai: “What were you doing in the Sunken Abyss?” Ming Yi: “To look for the Golden Millet Dream.” Bozai: “What about Ming Xian? Did getting poisoned and not having a spiritual vein anymore make him useless?  He can’t care less about your well-being. Is he even a man?” “Ming Yi: “He is not.  Happy?”  Oh Bozai. If only you knew. ](https://preview.redd.it/afq005zslewf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1f94f24f994b492d8d02233a9c62e0da6e1d1f9)\n\n# The emperor passes on his mantle\n\nAs the miasma released by the collapsing Sunken Abyss envelops the divine capital, the recruits training at Shuohua Academy try to keep the miasmia at bay.\n\n[I thought Yan Xiao and Yanqiu didn’t have spiritual veins?  I really need someone to explain how magical abilities work in this realm to me. ](https://preview.redd.it/m9sy6m3llewf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3395439301e1aaaeb4786f91cefbd505ae1077a)\n\nUltimately, it was the emperor who saves the day by sacrificing his body and primordial spirit to form a barrier that will protect the Jixing Abyss for a hundred years. I guess that officially makes Tianji the new ruler of Jixing Abyss.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4odhf298newf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30e29c82a1605b9fb3215d63a168f097e1887375\n\n# Bozai puts two and two together\n\nMVP of the drama turns out to a crossbow.  Who would have guessed?\n\nThe crossbow Ming Yi carried is too sophisticated. Only someone with warrior experience could have designed it. Bozai reasoned.\n\nAnd that’s when he starts remembering all of their interactions:\n\nWhen Ming Yi says that she’s Ming Xian’s….fiancee after a pause.\n\nWhen Ming Yi’s has that Ming Xian is not a man.\n\nWhen Min Yi says that embers is my…Ming Xian’s most importan artifact.\n\nThe list goes on and on. And honestly, I can’t believe that Bozai is only figuring it out now.\n\nBut that’s all in the past. The important thing is that Bozai again decides to take the initiative to lure Ming Yi out. Towards that end, he goes to Ming Yi both to test her and to offer to return Embers to her, with the condition that she makes him another artifact. Man, the guy is oozing charm out of every pore in his body…But when she shows up with a sword, he refuses to accept it and kisses her instead.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ed5fqjpflewf1.jpg?width=1648&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a9f45f417ee5c3c6cbce68d508a572c45e8ec3c\n\nNow Ming Yi’s got to realize that Bozai know something, doesn’t she?  But with the blinders she has been operating with for the last 25 episodes, I wouldn’t be surprised if Ming Yi still refuses to see what’s right under her nose.\n\n# In other news…\n\nThe emperor of Zhuoshui Spiritual State had Situ Ling imprisoned and tortured.  Fuyue uses all of her spiritual energy to heal his wounds.  Too bad all he can think about is still Ming Yi.  When Fuyue told him that Ming Yi had died in a state of pique, he almost went bananas.\n\nBut as he expected, now that he is the emperor’s only remaining son, the emperor can’t afford to kill him. Instead, Situ Ling pledges to find the Golden Millet Dream and use his newfound powers to help Zhuoshui become powerful and lord over the other realms.\n\nHave we just witnessed the beginning of Situ Ling’s villain original story?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o2z1ao53hewf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=660d4a9eef58ee2c4d1fc27cadf248d63e34b001\n\n# A few other things…\n\nI really enjoy Ming Yi and She Tian Lin’s interactions. I like the way she acts all cute around him and how exasperated he gets with her.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uppn89i3lewf1.jpg?width=2059&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18dcce5f097f9979251a56db4b2e63aeec73f21a\n\nAnd here’s my favorite line of the episode:\n\n[“我都不知道那個雞脖子給你灌了什麼迷魂湯?“ ”I don‘t even know what kind of bespelled soup that chicken neck fed you.“ ‘Chicken neck’ is pronounced Ji Bo Zi, which sounds like Ji Bo Zai. ](https://preview.redd.it/7cgtdpidjewf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b5f84e4d8545cf68cbbefd1fff677200a1db6a7)\n\n# So,\n\nIt looks like the gang will be heading to Zhangwei Mountain to find Part 2 of the Bo Medical Classics next. But more importantly, we have to be getting close to Bozai and Ming Yi having everything out in the open, right? Because even though I understand why Ming Yi lied, I can’t help but get a little exasperated with her for continuing to try to deflect Bozai from suspecting the truth throughout theses 2 episodes.  Enough is enough…\n\nSo how do you like our progress so far?  Sound off in the comments below.",

    "title": "TOP 10 Chinese Dramas for the week (October 13-19)",
    "content": "With big-budget costume dramas debuting almost every week, it can be hard to decide which ones are truly worth your time. For viewers who often wonder, *“What should I watch besides my favorite actor’s latest release?”* this ranking guide offers a good starting point. It spotlights the most-watched Chinese dramas of the week while also introducing lesser-known yet high-quality series that are earning strong praise in China but may remain unknown to global audiences. Within the top 10, you’ll find not only star-studded blockbusters but also hidden gems led by relatively unknown casts, celebrated for their compelling storytelling and impressive production values.\n\nKeep in mind that a single week’s ranking doesn’t necessarily reflect a show’s overall quality-it simply captures what’s trending at the moment. However, if a series stays in the top 10 for several weeks, that consistency is often a strong sign of enduring quality and broad appeal.\n\n**TOP 10 DRAMAS** (*Dramas that are airing on both TV/WEB are excluded from the Web List*)\n\n**Bold**\\- New Entry / **Bold +** ***Italics***\\- New No. 1\n\n|RANK|WEB (platforms)|TELEVISION (CCTV+Satellite)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Fated Hearts (Li Qin, Chen Zhe Yuan)- costume (2nd week)|***Silent Honor (Yu Hewei, Wu Yue)- republican (1st week)***|\n|2|Love in the clouds (Neo Hou, Lu Yuxiao)-costume|Hunting (Wang Yang, Zhang Youhao)- modern|\n|3|Yummy Yummy Yummy (Wang Yinglu, Li Yunrui)- costume|Love's Ambition (Zhao Lusi, William Chan)- modern|\n|4|The Hunt (Huang Xuan, Teresa Li, Bai yu Fan)- modern|**The Cheetah (Shi Pengyuan, Yang Shuo)- modern**|\n|5|The Journey of Legend (Cheng Yi, Guli Nazha)-costume|Growing Together S2 (Zhang Jiayi, Chen Hao)- modern comedy|\n|6|Hilarious Family Season 2 (Li Jiaqi, he Saifei)- costume|The Guardians (Zhang Yishen, Elvis Han)- republican|\n|7|Time Raiders (Francis Ng, Xu Zhenxuan)- modern|Wild Ambition Bloom (Rayzha, Tony Yang)- republican|\n|8|Justice is Mine (Nick Cheung, Myolie Wu)- modern|**Light beyond the Reed (Vin Zhang, Rachel mao)- modern**|\n|9|Mobius (Bai Jingting, Janice Man)- modern|The Long Way Back (Hun Jun, Li Naiwen)- republican|\n|10|Twelve Letters (Zhou Yiran, Wang Yinglu)- modern|This Thriving Land (Yang Mi, Ou Hao)- republican|\n\nIf a drama maintains its position in the weekly rankings for a long time, it will be moved to **“The Eternal List 2025”** \\-a special table highlighting the top 10 Chinese dramas released in 2025 so far. This list recognizes shows that have demonstrated lasting popularity and consistent viewer engagement. Please note that **The Eternal List is a work in progress and subject to updates as the year unfolds.**\n\n**THE ETERNAL LIST 2025**\n\n|RANK|DRAMA|SCORE (/100)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|This Thriving Land|77.79208333|\n|2|The Legend of Zang Hai|63.87958333|\n|3|In the Name of Justice|59.17395833|\n|4|Northward|55.359375|\n|5|Flourished Peony|52.02208333|\n|6|The Journey of the Legend|51.22864583|\n|7|Love's Ambition|43.875|\n|8|The Prisoner of Beauty|37.640625|\n|9|Drifting Away|36.33333333|\n|10|The Immortal Ascension|34.23166667|\n\n**How the score works for the Eternal List**\n\n1. TV peak rating (cap 5%) → 25 pts. Reflects national broadcast strength (CCTV + satellite). Top-tier dramas (≥ 4-5 %) dominate primetime ratings. This is like Nielsen rating.\n2. Kuyun TV market share (cap 5%) → 15 pts. Measures real-time audience share across channels; complements traditional TV ratings with live tracking.\n3. Yunhe market share (cap 50%) → 20 pts. Captures streaming ecosystem dominance across iQIYI, Tencent, Youku, etc.\n4. Average play per episode → +15 pts. Rewards consistency of viewer number across the run.\n5. Popularity heat ≥10,000 → +10 pts. Balances Tencent’s 0-30000 vs Youku/iQIYI’s 0-10000 scales. Measures online buzz &amp; virality.\n6. Total cumulative views → +10 pts. Rewards total views. This changes over time and is a dynamic parameter, affecting the ranking.\n7. Sustained #1 across charts/time slot (&gt;7 days) → +5 pts. Rewards consistency and long-term audience retention.\n8. A penalty of 3% if any of the parameters is not available and has to provided an estimated value based on other parameters.\n\n**This Week's Highlights**\n\n**What to watch?**\n\n**TV Dramas:** **Silent Honor** (huge viewership, espionage, war, spy thriller), **Light beyond the Reed** (psychological, emotional), **The Cheetah** (entered at rank 4, but a military drama)\n\n**Web Dramas:** **Love in the clouds** (picking up viewership, fantasy costume drama), **The Hunt** (suspense / crime / thriller drama, serious acting)\n\n*Ranking Process*\\- The ranking has been designed to be the ''Mother of all rankings''. I am using the average of data across Kuyun, Yunhe, Vlinkage, Douban charts, and Datawin, weightage at 20% each. The mean value is recalculated dynamically for each consultant, for each day, and for every drama, for a period of 7 days.\n\n*For further details, please check: Original post (details about ranking and other notes):* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top\\_10\\_cdramas\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_week\\_32/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top_10_cdramas_for_the_week_week_32/)\n\n*For Eternal list process, please check:* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o6ndlq/top\\_10\\_chinese\\_dramas\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_october\\_612/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o6ndlq/top_10_chinese_dramas_for_the_week_october_612/)",

Thanks again to u/huachenggege for letting me tag along in my first co-hosting discussion.  :)\n\nLast Fun Fact: Tofu was first recorded during the Han Dynasty. One theory says it was discovered by an Eastern Han Prince, a stone mural has some sort of mention of tofu.  Other theory is the Chinese developed tofu by accident when they mixed some salt and ground soybeans...the final theory was the Chinese were trying to imitate curdled milk the Mongolians had during the Sui Dynasty. It didn't become more popular until the Song Dynasty. Regardless, I'm a fan of tofu\n\nSide fun fact: I tested out the caramel fingerprint the other day because I was super curious I don't think it could have been done with normal caramel sugar, but maybe...and big maybe soft caramel.  You can fingerprint on the caramel itself but in terms of fingerprinting from something like a box, that's up to interpretation.  I made some soft chew caramels, tried to fingerprint from metal and bamboo a few different ways, it kind of worked but that's a big kind of.

How do you think this show will end?  We thinking happy ending? Tragic? I keep seeing edits on XHS that make it look sad, but then I see some happy ending stuff, who knows.  Guess we all find out tomorrow.\n\nCommentary:\n\nEpisode 25\n\nHonestly, the calm is what Papa Shen should be more worried about, it means she has given up. He really just doesn't get it and doesn't actually think about her. Knowing how long they've been married and was off by like 10+ years...seriously...your son is 30, come on\n\nTo really still think \"you've become the top chef\" and then to say \"we now have money, I don't understand why you're still like this\"\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xsleikbf2cwf1.gif\n\nGo through with the divorce Mama Li...he needs to learn what he's taken for granted for too long\n\nSide note, it's a different character (窦 here vs 都 in Blossom) but I couldn't help thinking he's dealing with another family named Dou again (Blossom) lol\n\nOh wow, I was like, I didn't realize Lin Yan would be that ruthless with that many severed heads, but it was just a trick with balls lol\n\nLin Yan coming specifically to tell the Shens to be careful...he's worried about them 🥹\n\nI see we're still angsty and torturing ourselves\n\nI love the hug recharge\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6jx23l4i2cwf1.gif\n\nSeriously y'all, Gongcai is worthless.  He didn't learn to cook? He should go home and learn how to do things first.\n\nI like this new cook, but I'm naturally suspicious of him lol\n\nMr. Pei dropping the news that Lin Yan is engaged to Ms. Shen\n\nMama Li is going on a bit of a shopping therapy, maybe Papa Shen will start to realize he's a jerk\n\nWow, he really thought she could be cheating on him...Shen Men are useless.  No wonder Gongcai is how he is, his dad was the perfect example.  Gongcai just wanted someone like Mama Li who just did everything and run everything, then a daughter who's also helpful so that they can sit back.\n\nEpisode 26\n\nSo Gongcai is back and is going to work at the rival tavern\n\nlol a beard is enough of a cover\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9klki5al2cwf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc83c9e3a119c1af5856c42536d87404aa3f6fe1\n\nHmm yeah the new chef might be suspicious a bit, maybe he's working for Yunlai\n\nHa, reality check for Papa Shen that he's not that great\n\nThis montage was a bit unnecessary but I get that's my personal biased against Papa Shen lol\n\nAh yes, the cooking competition\n\nThe longing...\n\nAww y'all I really like the cast singing the background song here.\n\nHere's the link if you want to hear the full song: [https://youtu.be/h6kNUsAW\\_OI?t=265&amp;si=CefOHqyZD\\_\\_qzE2K](https://youtu.be/h6kNUsAW_OI?t=265&amp;si=CefOHqyZD__qzE2K)\n\nHonestly, I hope Ms. Shen wins so that she can tell her grandfather she can support herself and it takes Papa Shen down a notch. She did a good job interpreting the theme\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qq3yrn6w2cwf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0de5b0aea65b66ec26a2d1cc2e04f796aa5052c\n\nGuixiang's is so pretty, definitely also a poetic interpretation\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xpmlerw2cwf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6d4d0a02ccfb3fcd5e4f93402cedb1d8c647160\n\nYunlai's is impressive too...is it just the one dish and it's suppose to be a fish carved in a dragon?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0p2t5hnx2cwf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98dac3d30b65dab591d53f8206c66a316e973660\n\nI guess it's fitting that the Shen Diner is known for the commoners and affordable, so he makes homey meals...aww he included Lin Yan\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mukgx8sz2cwf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0825774090f3a40bb65e706c37dfa629518816d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e51japo03cwf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b5d1a0fa1aa51c0c28ed4a32356f6f4e34f24d1\n\nEpisode 27\n\nAw go Ms. Shen for winning\n\nlol this whole thing\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ets6uwi13cwf1.jpg?width=2880&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e556e7b2306da58df0060d44f03c9926b656f087\n\nLOL poor Liu Feng\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xq9zkru73cwf1.jpg?width=2799&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=390162753d95d3e862d224504d85805fc2faeda1\n\nLin Yan's face here says it all...done with his BS lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nfe4qf83cwf1.jpg?width=2744&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7912d5bfc20860ffba2fdb402e9beaa4aae8dd4\n\nHis mom calling him out for his lies lol\n\nSee the new chef is suspicious\n\nYes an open door into a place you're trying to sneak into...doesn't just scream trap to you?\n\nWow...Shen Shaojie, you really are more than willing to just let Lin Yan take your place?\n\nI really appreciate that it's a cleaver they're holding against Gongcai's neck...tavern and all\n\nWhat if we're wrong and San'er isn't the mole? He probably is though right?  I feel so bad for him though, talking about how they're the only ones who are nice to him.\n\nOh yeah, I forgot about Prince Zhao\n\nThat is such a large cleaver lol\n\nAw that's cute, win him with kindness with the birthday cake. Poor guy, mom and dad being threatened by the Prince.\n\nI will give you one thing, the Prince does seem hesitant to kill Lin Yan, he does seem to care for him a bit.\n\nSo...is the play from Prince Zhao just to take Lin Yan out of power so he stops investigating?  Will that work?\n\nHonestly, I can't wait to see how this all turns out tomorrow, see you guys in the express episode thread.",

When I care about the sub plots alot with the main, you are doing something super good. Ex: princess and Xiao., princess trying to out with her uncle. \n\nThe problem arises with the main couple.. for the life of me, I can't get behind the reason OR  LACK of reason Ming yi has continued to lie to  Bozai. \n\nTo me it just feels drama for the sake of it.. she could have been honest with him and abandoned him to seek a cure on her own instead of having him choose her over his savior/master. I feel that could have had the same effect as betraying him and or not trusting him. \n\nCan someone explain to me why she continues to be dishonest? ",

It really feels like the air time was too short and I had to run a mile every day to catch up, I wish they were a little slower. Anyways, let's dive in into the discussion, shall we?\n\nEpisode 23\n\nThe tension between the Shen parents has continued, and despite him coaxing her and giving her gifts, she can't seem to accept them. It is kind of realistic, while she has struggled and maintained the Shen men all her life, all she gets is getting ridiculed for being too strict and then a half-hearted apology with gifts to make amends. I'd be mad too.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9cperglubwf1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5d282c3b77b0565d252a3da38eb1a4cbeb253f8\n\nFor New Year's eve, Princess Fuhui visits Mr. Pei and tries to emotionally manipulate him and Mr. Pei from his guilt for avoidance, reluctantly agrees to hang out with her.\n\nAt the Shens, everyone gives red envelope to Yangyang and Lin Yan, unprepared, also gives her a pouch full of money for blessing. Deyuan also receives money from Jicai.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cqgu9vxnubwf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12371856e2676695ce8b4f057ab58613b70739da\n\nYangyang misses her father, and Mother Shen shares the coin and letter Gongcai sent for them. Gongcai, unlike what he claims, isn't reaching anywhere near the peak he wanted to achieve, in fact, his repeated attempt to ''earn'' money has foiled again and again and all he gets is poorer and more beat up by the people, thinking he is a scammer.\n\nI just don't understand what he is trying to prove, but to me, he isn't any better than the loser he was when he left.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdwz2ve0tawf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d0536495ebb29b675c66371efba646a5e3e7dcf\n\nFather Shen, however, believes the letter and is even proud of Gongcai, and also announces that their renovated diner will open after the New Years.\n\nLin Yan wishes Jicai a happy new year, but poor Jicai is conflicted, and can't accept her heart, she has resorted to physical pain to cover her heartache.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ic2o7au1tawf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65c6240171ac2db078cb01212570933fe06e8a05\n\nPrincess Fuhui comes to the diner with Mr. Pei in tow and wishes to have their hotpot. The Shens left to watch the fireworks, leaving Jicai and Lin Yan and so the Princess comes up with a trick to play the matchmaker. She announces she will host banquet after the new years and asks Jicai to be the chef. Between conversation, Mr. Pei tells how Lin Yan is one of the heaviest drinker and doesn't get drunk easily, which Lin Yan tries to play off. But it makes Jicai nervous as she wonders if Lin Yan remembered their kiss. She is also angry that he pretended to forget.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l0bm9z2tawf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=148d1adc671774383851d05bcf316d08229db756\n\nAfter dinner, she goes to see the warehouse with them to pick the ingredients for the banquet, but then she tricks Jicai and Lin Yan into entering first and locks the door from behind.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vb821974tawf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77bb078ef923e0791bc884a95f86a5b818fc735c\n\nJicai panicks and huffs to unlock the door, but Lin Yan tells her to induldge the princess as she loves to play tricks. Lin Yan sits down quietly and asks if her family likes water-shield dumplings, but Jicai said they didn't have them much, which implied that Jicai got the water shield specifically for him. It makes him feel pleased.\n\nSoon, there's firework and Jicai runs to watch, with Lin Yan following suit. Jicai is mesmerised and accidentally runs into Lin Yan, kissing him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a85llbn5tawf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=623d4bc92979c3ee0a9d34c19877cd7aebec1e84\n\nAnd boy do i scream, lin Yan completely seizes the chance! He confesses he remembers the night they kissed and pulls her close into a kiss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6b1cxr6tawf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c216d4a6024e6faf3b805e655b8e0a2e159e00ce\n\nJicai is very panicked, and pulls on her bracelet, which Lin Yan sees and tries to see for himself, they struggle and run into the shelves, the pickle jar dropping and all the doodles of Jicai toppling over them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/up8ch218tawf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12d3ce4e60ff39f03b1519739606238bd6eebf19\n\nIn the meantime, when Princess Fuhui tries to share her heart, Mr. Pei refuses her and tells her he can't reciprocate her feelings. Heartbroken and Princess Fuhui leaves.\n\nInside, Lin Yan reads his name on the papers and Jicai quickly denies writing them. But instead of asking about them, Lin Yan asks why she was so adamant on refusing him while she clearly had feelings for him as well. But Jicai braves her heart and denies being in love with him, and even going as far as to confess the truth that she wasn't the girl who was engaged to Lin Yan.\n\nLin Yan is very shocked. Jicai also tells him that the whole family lied and took advantage of him because they needed a place to stay and she even met the real woman, Lady Zheng, who was originally engaged to him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddamb289tawf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f3377d7d3fdfa94f526c418b13751ed0aac4816\n\nZheng in Qingyang accent is very close to Shen, so she made use of the opportunity to deceive him. Clearly heartbroken and mad, Lin Yan kicks the door, the lock easily breaking and walks out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzwchccatawf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abe99651f60ee622c4adc28c10ffaa2502750aa4\n\nIt wasn't that Lin Yan couldn't get them out of the locked warehouse, he just chose not to, but Jicai just went ahead and ruined it all with her own hands. She breaks into tears, breaking both Lin Yan's and her own heart.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4iez5ybbtawf1.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c800bdd681d5c60fcf9358b564b01beedda30e4b\n\nThe Shens open the renovated diner and business is bustling, but Lin Yan doesn't visit. In fact, he doesnt return to Yunshui Manor at all. He is busy serving the commoner folks at the Capital Prefecture and stays behind with work as an excuse.\n\nJicai is also trying to keep her busy with work to forget her aching heart, but she remembers how Lin Yan had promised to take her to watch the Lantern Festival.\n\nLiu Chang finds out there is indeed a Lady Zheng in Shi'an and Lin Yan says he'll visit Qingyang to find her. Liu Chang has brought him some snacks since its Lantern Festival, which reminds Lin Yan of his promise to take Jicai to the Lantern Festival.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nol6ozcetawf1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=539d48e189d467a2e8a7c5531d35fa7a8ea1b1c1\n\nBoth are suffering, both just making it hard on themselves. Poor babies :((\n\nMother Shen finds out Jicai had been struggling and hurting herself, so Jicai confesses her heart aches so much that she wanted to feel physical pain to get rid of her heartache. She breaks into tears into her mother's arms.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0bk7zcftawf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f44d0b4efdd101c3319960103e2d8160dfb9a155\n\nEpisode 24\n\nThis episode has so many things going on and so many big reveals!! we find out that Yunlai owner Mr. Liu isn't a simple man and he might even be holding bigger secrets. With Lin Yan's marriage rumourss with Lady Jingwen, Liu waits for the opportunity to sabotage Jicai.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/agoe37egtawf1.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14f2e90b62dcf15d31365e35bd792baae944b850\n\nLin Yan has come to Shi'an and finds Ledy Zheng, who is pregnant and lives in an average home. And she's pretty!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7r56jcchtawf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=780eeb61a47477bc2be8d10fc370c535a9181e4e\n\nLin Yan lies and says he's Liu Chang and they're looking for the magistrate, so Lady Zheng invites them in, telling them how good a man the magistrate is. She tells them how his only wish is to serve the people and that he is very humble.\n\nLin Yan finds her very talkative but naive. She offers them water shield pastries, and also tells them abit meeting Jicai. She tells them how she had gotten badly injured from going to pick the water shields and that she must have craved them a lot for going at such lengths.\n\nLin Yan feels conflicted. But the topic gets diverted when Lady Zheng mentions she's from Qingyang.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bob8u68itawf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=070a308c930789d2adf99964de2c9a71dcfd7be5\n\nShe tells them how the family she was engaged into got in trouble and they had to leave Qingyang. However, last Spetember, someone enquired about that family and she wants to investigate about that because it didn;t seem normal.\n\nLin Yan asks her for details. but Lady Zheng is clever and tests them to figure out which side they are on. Finding them trustworthy, she reveals the magistrate was her husband and she didn't fear anyone. Lin Yan also introduces himself properly and tells her he is investigating the Qingyang Cui case.\n\nLady Zheng says both the magistrate and she believed that the Cui family was sabotaged and reveals that the fourth son of Prince Zhao inquired about their engagement. She also reveals that Prince Zhao appears enmity with Noble Consort Dou, but in reality they are in cahoot and the Dou family keeps contact with Prince Zhao.\n\nShe connects Magistrate Dou, Prince Zhao and the Cui case together and suspects there might be more to this. Lin Yan thanks her for the information and leaves.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rh0vr9ejtawf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fde242447887d212aa6451124e9c946b433377c\n\nThey pass by the Shens and father Shen tries to stop him and invite him to have dinner. But Lin Yan refuses and even remarks with hurt when they call him family.\n\nBut Deyuan brings the hotpot box which Jicai holds up to give him from the carriage, it must have been heavy, and she holds it for quite long. Lin Yan glances at th new bruises around her wrist and can't bear to see her pain. He takes the box and leaves.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwtg3hfktawf1.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab29a5c7a0d325c892faac08eca3faa4debdaa6\n\nChancellor Meng visits Lin Yan and proposes marriage for his granddaughter. Lin Yan tries to refuse but Mr. Meng doesn't take no for an answer. Later, Lady Jingwen visits Lin Yan and asks if he really wishes to marry her, but Lin Yan apologises to her and says he can't marry her.\n\nLady Jingwen sees the ruler and Jicai's name on it, and understands Lin Yan has someone else in his heart. She also agrees not to marry him, however, requests him not to refuse her grandfather yet as she has things to do before that.\n\nAt night, both Jicai and Lin Yan ponders about each other and decides to come out of the heartbreak. Jicai throws away her wristlet, and Lin Yan throws away the ruler.\n\nThe next day Yangyang is missing, however, it turns out she visited Lin Yan without informing the Shen family. They apologize to him, but he dismisses them. So, the Shen family sincerely asks for forgiveness for betraying and using him, and that such a thing won't happen again.\n\nJicai also promises there will never be a next time. Such emphasis makes Lin Yan conflicted, Jicai also offers their help in the Cui case in future, but Lin Yan only stares at her.\n\nThe next day, Father Shen tries to make it cool with Fangxia but she doesn't appease him. Full of complaints, he goes off to a tavern, where two servers try to serve him.\n\nJicai comes up with the idea to have their food delivered, and Mother Shen goes to do the first delivery and goes to the same tavern where Father Shen was. She sees him with the servers and Father Shen panicks. He screams for help.\n\nShe is shocked, but then she sits down and tells the servers to serve her instead. She gives them money and tells them to leave.\n\nThat's all for today! Next u/sequesteredself will take over the discussions. Wishing all of you will enjoy the upcoming episodes!",

When he died, it was Suige's turn to have blood on his face.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ua2yt5vdo1wf1.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a70dc24f43b30e6dd8f877966c701897e11306a7\n\nI find it interesting that it is Yixiao who put in the kill shot. And I think she deserves that shot because she surely wants to avenge her dearest love's severe injuries and trauma from the Marquis' vicious stabbing.\n\nWhat I find interesting about Suige is that when he wreaks vengeance on his enemies, he is fair. He doesn't attack them from behind like most of them did. He allows them to prattle their justifications and say their peace before he gives them permanent peace.\n\nThe Marquis? Well, what can I say - I really thought he'd be the last person to plunge the dagger into Suige and ruthlessly order him thrown into an unmarked grave in the wilderness. Not even a tiny tear shed for the bond he might have had with Suige, which makes me question the depth of his affection for Suige.\n\nFunnily, I thought the Marquis didn't put up much of a fight, or couldn't, seeing that he was injured, I suppose. But again, nice mirroring here - while he was injured, Suige did not ruthlessly skewer him like the Marquis did.\n\n**Did you find their deaths satisfying??**",

    "title": "Thought I'd finally like Love in the Clouds but I think I might be dropping this",
    "content": "I started Love in the Clouds for Lu Yuxiao and Hou Minghao but absolutely **NOTHING happens in the first 8 or 9 episodes**. OK, maybe saying NOTHing happens is an exaggeration because something does happen, they fake flirt for the 139e9r038289th time and stuff but nothing much happens in the plot. I still ended up staying because I liked the dynamics Tianji and Yan Xiao had. \n\nBut after that the drama got wayyyyyyy more interesting. The drama became more plot heavy rather than flirting heavy (and by flirting I don't mean romance because what happened I'm the first 8 episodes shouldn't really count as romance). But now I feel like dropping the drama again. \n\n**One of the main reasons is that ALL THE CHARACTER EXCEPT JBZ are written I'm a VERY inconsistent manner**. It started with **Situ Liung** who was nice, cute and a little puppy like dummy who was secretly smart but very underestimated. He's in love with *JiEjiE* aka Ming Yi but I swear sometimes his love seems so forced and obsessive which is very out of character for someone like him.\n\n Then we have **Ming Yi**. People love her, people hate her, but you have to admit her actions don't make sense!!! People are complaining about JBZ feeling betrayed by Mingyi and losing his trust when Ming Yi NEVER trusted JBZ enough to tell her identity and kept lying to him. At one point, I really wondered WHY she was lying. Yes, i get it, you're childhood was rough and your mum was terrible and I genuinely feel bad for you. You don't have to be nice like JBZ who went through he'll but still trusted you but like CAN YOU AT LEAST NOT LIE TO HIM???? JUST TELL HIM YOU HAVE A SECRET IDENTITY YOU CANT TELL HIM YET BUT YOU WILL EVENTUALLY. She's a hypocrite for what she's doing. I feel her but at the same time I think she needs to start using her brain a little. She **KNOWS** JBZ loves her and is still lying to him. Ughhhhhh. \n\nDon't even get me started with **Yan Xiao**. His character arc was THE WORST! He hurt the princess, hurt her ego, her trust, attacked her self respect, self worth and dignity FOR FREAKING WHAT?????? He was so power hungry and wanted to rise up the ladder but when he realised his supporter was evil what did he do? He hurt the lOvE oF HiS LiFe. He could've just told Tianji the truth but instead he goes to JBZ because he has to \"protect her\". The only thing Tianji needs protection from his your evil heart! \n\n**I also wish the drama showcased the lives of their fl characters more**. Ming Yi had to live as a man for her whole life just to keep her throne. Tianji was a princess, daughter of the ruler of her kingdom but she had barely any power or status after her dad fell into a coma. When she made the rules people questioned her but the same rules were repeated by a man (like how JBZ backed the princess when she told everyone Yan Xiao would be part of the group thing in the academy) people obeyed him without question. Tianji was looking for a husband because she knew she wouldn't be able to rule her kingdom since people didn't like or trust female rulers. I'm fact, it's not just them, all the fairies in their realm had were forced to not use their powers. That just shows how misogynistic and sexist their world is. Since the writers have brought it up, why not explore it a little and give our fl characters more depth? So far, only the ml characters have a past that makes us audience sympathise with them. You can argue that this is a romance story so they don't need to show feminism and I'm not saying all dramas need to show feminism. For example, in  TTEOTM the 9 taled fox also had a backstory but it had nothing to do with feminism but in LITC **most female characters have gone through tragedies because they are women so it would be nice if they showed their struggles**. \n\nThis is a good drama but not really for me.

However now my question is, for Liao Tiyang, it’s only been a few hours since she parted ways with him, but for Sima Jao, it’s been well over or more than 20 years, so did he just wait for her all along, knowing she’d show up? If this is so, I just wish he had a better reaction after waiting that long? When she forgot her memories in the Demon Realm, he cried when he saw her again after 18 years, but this time he only did not even a full, but slight smile? There’s no scene of him after her death in the last episode, so are there any ideas what happened to him? I also saw a comment that said he met her again in the modern world after 1000 years, but I see no evidence of that, I thought it was around 20 more years but I could be wrong since he was the emperor and probably wouldn’t leave his citizens behind like that. Either way, any ideas?",

    "content": "But first let's appreciate Li Qin's aura cuz DAMN that's what a female General should have, an aura that sets the world on fire. She doesn't need to say a word, one glance and you'll should be on your knees! This is my first Li Qin drama and she definitely left an impression on me\n\nNow moving on........\n\nI'm a fan of enemies to lovers but the enemies to lovers trope in Fated Hearts was too brutal for me. Kicking a woman continuously and physically torturing her for A DAMN ARROW AS IF YOU NEVER NEARLY DIED IN A BATTLEFIELD AND YOUR DAD DIDNT MAKE EUNUCH'S SLAP YOU is brutal. I was so mad at the ml until I saw the fl do the same to him so......... But after that I don't know how bit the writers and directors made their reconciliation look so natural? Like it made sense why they started working together and why they acted together. I'm still confused on how the ml fell in love with her so quickly BUT that's probably just me. They were such a healthy couple after that and I love the growth both the characters have. They remained powerful in their own rights and respected each other. Honestly, this has to be one of the healthiest cdrama couples to exist!!! I also really appreciate Chen Zheyuan's acting here. I'm not a big fan of his work and neither am I a fan of his acting but he definitely did a phenomenal job here!!! \n\nThe plot was teaaaaaaaaaaaaa but I was really annoyed at the fact that the king made the same mistake by not telling Murong the dad about that he wasn't planning to kill Murong Yao (that's what Feng Suige told him right?). If he had said so he would've probably been alive. He made the same mistake again but I'm glad Feng Suige didn't repeat his dad's mistake and let his step mother live for his brother's sake. His brother was the only innocent character here and honestly he was  one of the victims of his mum and grand-dad. Well..... ALL the children except Murong Yao were victims of their parents, the Jinxu emperor, Feng Suige, Chengcheng they all suffered because their parents forced their own dreams and ambitions on their children. It's ironic that Murong Yao had a parent who genuinely cared for him and didn't force his dreams on him but he was the one who turned out to be a spoilt apple. \n\nEmperor of Jinxu, WHY DID U DIEEEEEEE 😭😭😭. Honestly, his character was crap but I wish they showed us how he became a better human being and treated others well too, not just the princess. The Princess was annoying at the beginning but her arc with the emperor was interesting. But I'm still salty about the fact that they gave only a few episodes. I wanted to see him from the very first episode!!!\n\n\nOverall, this drama is an 8/10 for me. Definitely has a lot of flaws but if you ignore or fast forward through those this is a good watch!",

Through this intricate criminal mystery, the story reveals people sinking into the quagmire of destiny and unfolds a tale of women mounting a desperate, last-ditch counterattack.!&lt;\n\n[Baidu Baike](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%87%8D%E5%BD%B1/63115981) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/36455133/) \n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses I share in the \"trailers &amp; posters\" posts are based on the original Chinese sources (Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

    "title": "The Thing About Endings",
    "content": "#Endings\n\nIt's no secret that the way a drama goes about wrapping up its story can make or break the overall impression left on audiences. \n\nEveryone has a preference, happy endings, sad endings... But is it all really that black and white? \n\nA sad ending isn't necessarily a bad ending and a good ending isn't necessarily a happy ending. \n\n#Perspective \n\nI've seen a little discussion recently regarding Cdramas and how some have felt there is a trend towards themes of sadness and loss. \n\nBut I wonder if this interpretation of \"endings\" might be related to the international audience's relationship with \"complete stories\". \n\nAs someone not in Asia, I have always been exposed mostly to **series**. \n\n#Series\n\nWhether adapted from pre-existing IP, or created from scratch, series in western media are not built around an **ending**. \n\n(Looking at you *Supernatural*)\n\nNot only this, but quite often, a series wouldn't even know if it's been renewed for another season until the latest season has completed airing.  \n\nThese circumstances contribute to a feeling of security when it comes to the safety of a story's main characters.\n\n#Dramas\n\nGranted, it's not like international media doesn't have dramas as well, but from a personal perspective, I never actually watched a drama until I watched a Cdrama (shocking and shameful I know).\n\nA drama has a single overarching storyline where a series can have many dalliances along each season.\n\nBasically, a drama only has one chance to make a lasting impression. \n\nIt's not just about being entertaining.\n\nIt's not just about how \"on-the-edge-of-your-seat\" each episode has you.\n\nIt's about remembering the drama once it has concluded it's run. It's about having a story that stays rent free on the audience's minds for (hopefully) years to come. \n\n#In Conclusion \n\nThe concept of an \"ending\" is unique to dramas and therefore their approach to the construction of a story is completely different from what some of us are used to.\n\nJust because you cry your eyes out doesn't mean it's a bad ending. Usually, those are the most memorable ones. \n\nI would argue that it is more of an uphill battle for dramas with happy endings to reach \"history-in-the-making\" levels of infamy. ",

However, the plot has significantly progressed, as new hints of evidence shed some light on the Cui Family case. \n\nEpisode 21\n\nThe Shen family are scammed by the house agent, Ms. Du and Mother Shen bursts into anger seeing the poor condition of the new house they rented, broken and dishevelled. \n\nThe price was hefty, and the Shen Gongcai receive the burn of it as he failed to inspect the house before paying for it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqeefoevc3wf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=309ad3d5928f20d18ee5f8c9b80af4080f42c737\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofbenx1fd3wf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=244be6272ebc7f5aee44e76c2623661d86c6b770\n\nEven Yangyang is disappointed. Someone files a complaint of agent fraud, and Lin Yan is informed. He is surprised to hear it's the Shen Family who were swindled. \n\n  \nMr. Liu found the address where the swindler Ms. Du lives and takes the Shen Family there, but the house was being sealed. Upon query, they find out it's Lin Yan who sent the Prefecture officers to arrest Ms. Du.\n\nAt the prefecture, the Shen Family is very surprised seeing Ms. Du, and Yangyang calls her mama, but Gongcai swiftly stops them, clarifying they just look alike. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4c336kaf3wf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a922fcac201d0b55630232bfe94c9609a2de418e\n\nHowever, Gongcai defends her and asks for mercy as she was helpless, but Lin Yan tells them that she was at fault for inflating house prices and also became rich from high commissions and she also had a large mansion and several servants.  \n\nMs. Du begs the Shens for forgiveness, and even returns the money, otherwise she will be imprisoned. Seeing her begging on her knees, Gongcai remembers the past in the modern world, when she left him for a rich man, he had even ''drove'' ( *as claimed in episode 17 or 18 xD but turns out he just paddled his cycle to the rich man's house xD* ) her there. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gjjulueg3wf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e11b0f997f25da2fd8c735096f9a3ebdd52ad87f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m25ekyxhg3wf1.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fef4dce7aba7f3e43a168681bbe5b053793c649d\n\nSeeing a woman with her mother's face begging like that makes the Shen family hesitate and Yangyang cries and tells her father to forgive Ms. Du.  \n  \nYangyang also emotionally confesses that she knows her father isn't perfect and often messes up, but she doesn't expect much from her father either. Hearing that embarrasses and hurts Gong Cai and he also breaks down in tears, feeling pathetic and embarrassed that he couldn't even complete the task the Shen Family relied on him for. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bfa8vzpkg3wf1.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0b8004916f6b61d315dbd1eb49c27cff2f1f93c\n\nThe Shen family lets Ms. Du go and as they leave the prefecture, they refuse the carriage by Lin Yan and goes back in Mr. Liu's carriage. Lin Yan doesn't like it and even ''tells'' Mr Liu to safely drop the Shen Family at teh diner, but the underlying message was clear as he puts strength in his grip on his shoulder ''stay away from my in laws'' (swooooooooon!!!) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/et1mvc2xg3wf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=221abc33d2d901d0981a23ff9152abe91983a15f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf9i6h0nk3wf1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d106d76914929334140c74f508024bd633af991e\n\nLater, Grandfather Liu exclaims that it was better that they didn't send a formal wedding proposal for Shen Shaoguang, as it would have offended Lin Yan and even advises him to stay as a partner, as that would also keep both families close. \n\nLater, Gongcai has shut himself off inside a room and is reading sutra, while the Shen family tries to bring him out, panicking that Gongcai may have taken all the criticism too harshly. Both parents Shen fail to bring him out, even Yangyang cries and apologises and tells him that he can also become a hero and that she will believe in him, she also apologizes for criticising him. This makes Gongcai break into tears again. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4nc2sk3bl3wf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e10b71e7bc23fac52ef914153a0d0ee6bca86c2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/te05quihl3wf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78acb88936cd031f35e0ac458b78c2dc2b77cabd\n\nThe next day, Lin Yan meets his father's friend, and figures out Zhao Xunzhi, who betrayed his father and changed his testimony, has been nurturing soldiers who pretend to die and come to the capital as spies. They question who would need so many soldiers and Lin Yan tells him secretly that it may be Prince Zhao, who has great ambitions. He has also been manipulating official positions and secretky placing his own people in higher positions. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otflpvgzl3wf1.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7feeec615020e09c376a737edd7718b0835f60d\n\nBut they can't figure out how to approach Zhao Xunzhi.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4btr7b7m3wf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d05d423824df240247dc665d40583fdd5392db\n\nAt Shen's DIner, Jingwen arrives and confesses to Jicai that she is planning to get married to Lin Yan and that her grandfather also approves of him. Hearing that, Jicai is very upset and sad. She tells her that he will treat his wife really well, but he has many painful memories in his heart and that she must take care of him well.\n\nHearing that, Jingwen jokes that it sounded like she was giving away her son, but it was really Jicai just giving away her heart :(( \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2ih1riwm3wf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=077f4db5afc50a53285a645592e0c92557a4cdf3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5pcg0j4n3wf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff8d19a1dfee2b504a498e1bf428b968fb4305df\n\nLater, Yangyang insists on going to Hongwen school, and Gongcai hears that. However, the next day, the Shens get called to the Hongwen Academy and Zhao Xunzhi tells them that Yangyang could study there.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2zy4ex8n3wf1.png?width=1092&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0be9ece484823225cacffe8b39b27315e70d727a\n\nThey are surprised and asks him how did he agree to get a girl admitted to the academy and he tells them how Gongcai has been pastering him day and night and wouldn't leave him alone, so he had to agree to get her admitted to get rid of Shen Gongcai. But the condition was that Yangyang would have to dress as a male child. \n\nThe Shen Family hurries home and looks for Gongcai, but he left home, saying he will only come back after gaining fame and glory. Yangyang is sad and the Shens cosole her saying he will be back when she studies well and reaches the peak. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/71hhq3djn3wf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c4098b55cb87349ea25ff3aaea409853cbcd6d8\n\nZhao Xunzhi refuses to meet anyone, and Lin Yan worries it maybe Prince Zhao who warned Zhao Xunzhi.   They can't risk approaching him at Hongwen, however, Yangyang hears the conversation and offers to help by announcing that she got into Hongwen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dilsgwgyn3wf1.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b58906a2615ac7382391ba4cb7a9538951abc0d9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t630vo0fo3wf1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=874f21d921dca1894b0ff0c0defe8d8167d50c98\n\nHowever, Lin Yan hears that and tells her that Hongwen is problematic and that the Shens shouldn't send her there. But Yangyang tells him that he can approach Zhao XUnzhi through her and hearing that, Lin Yan disapproves and takes her back immediately.  \n  \nJicai scolds Yangyang for having such thought and even reprimands Lin Yan for putting such ideas into a child's head, but Lin Yan denies having done that. He was even hurt that Jicai would think that about him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9c8yi6xho3wf1.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a6069877d3576bd77a377e3c69afd122da6c9e6\n\nLin Yan tells her that when he heard Yangyang say that, he immediately brought her back because he couldn't scold someone else's daughter (*you can scold me Xiao Lin, as much as you want* :3)   \n  \nThe misunderstanding doesn't persist though, and Yangyang tells her that it was her who offered to help. Although wronged, Lin Yan doesn't hold it against Jicai and Jicai also apologizes. \n\nLin Yan even says casually that he can never be angry at her, which makes Jicai feel guilty (and maybe her fluttered too!) but Yangyang insists to study at Hongwen and also wants to help Lin Yan. \n\nMother Shen remarks Harvard has also produced criminals, but that doesn't make Harvard a bad place, so studying at Hongwen for the time wouldn't be dangerous. Father Shen also remarks that her studying there can actually give Lin Yan the opportunity to approach Zhao Xunzhi. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4izeky9op3wf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51af1e5839f3cc39fcd49641df0b51ab3413d224\n\nJicai apologizes again and Lin Yan, this guy, can't stay mad anymore. \n\nEpisode 22 \n\nFather Shen drops Yangyang off at the Hongwen Academy, on the way Yangyang casually mentions how everyone of their family has somewhat changed, but her grandmother was still the same as before. This makes Father Shen wonder. He buys her a carriage, and makes a big drama to make her happy, but ends up insulting her. He also slips from the high roof. This makes her mad and throws the keys to the carriages. \n\nAt Hongwen, when Master Zhao teaches the students that the earth was a square, Yangyang tries to correct them, but they none of them believe that earth is round. I think it was the Prince who found her debate interesting. \n\nMaster Zhao calls for her guardian and Jicai comes, but instead of scolding ZHao Xunzhi only advices her to stay quiet in class to not draw too much attention. Jicai takes the opportunity to invite him to their diner for dinner. \n\nLin Yan is very worried that Jicai invited a dangerous person to their house and also touched that she did something like that for him. Jicai tells him not to waste this opportunity. \n\nIn the evening, when Zhao Xunzhi arrives, the Shens keep toasting him alcohol, making him drunk. When he sits alone, drooping, Lin Yan appears. At first sight, Zhao Xunzhi thinks it's Mr. Cui and calls out his name, but soon relaises it was Lin Yan. \n\nHe exclaims that he dressed like Mr. Cui, but Lin Yan pretends not to know him and asks about him. He asks if he had a friend whom he betrayed and Zhao Xunzhi is very shocked. Lin Yan now directly asks if he changed his testimony in the post-selling case 17 years ago and convicted Mr. Cui.\n\nHearing that Zhao Xunzhi breaks into tears and Lin Yan makes him agree to testify. \n\nPrince Zhao, who has been praying in front of his eldest son's plaque says how he might one day send Lin Yan to join him. His younger son appears and informs him that Lin Yan had found ZHao Xunzhi.\n\nPrince Zhao tells him to send spies to take care of Zhao Xunzhi. \n\nThe next day, Yangyang informs Lin Yan that Zhao Xunzhi didn't come to Hongwen. It turns out he returned to his hometown to mourn someone, Lin Yan is very angry and burst out in anger. He also sends Liu Chang to find him alive or deed. \n\nLater, Jicai hesitates for an hour outside Lin Yan's room, with food and Yangyang in tow. Unable to wait any longer, she bangs on Lin Yan's door. She's about to flee when Lin Yan opens the door to take the food. \n\nWhen he's about to close the door, Jicai stops him and then prepares the food for him. But Lin Yan says he wasn't hungry. Thinking that he is depressed over the case, Jicai scolds him and tells him not to lose appetite over just one hurdle. \n\nHowever, Lin Yan says he was waiting for food and was hungry, and since they were late, he ate some cake. So he wasn't hungry. Yangyang betrays her aunt and tells Lin Yan how she didn;t want to enter so she wasted an hour standing in front of the door. It makes Jicai embarrassed and hse tries to run away.\n\nLin Yan grabs onto her arm but soon lets go. Lin Yan shows her the letter Prince Zhao had sent him, where he claimed Zhao Xunzhi as upright and a good mentor, It was clearly a lie and sent out to test Lin Yan. He was pretending not to know that ZHao Xunzhi was missing. \n\nSuch blatant lie made Jicai mad. Liu Chang arrives, snow-covered in a rush and tells them that Zhao Xunzhi never went to his hometown and his clan members there were pretending that he was there. It makes Lin Yan mad and he flips the things on the table in a huff of anger. \n\nSeeing him flipping things, Jicai also flips over some scrolls, to express his anger. Altogether, they start throwing everything, flipping things over and breaking the vases into pieces. Soon, the room turns into a mess, everyone in smiles. They sit down, tored and all anger flushed out. \n\nJicai tells him once the phase of anger passes, a way will come out. It makes Lin Yan happy. Yangyang also tells him to not angry and to take care of himself. Since the new years was close, she invites them to dinner. \n\nLiu Chang comments how previously it was just the two of them, but now with the Shen Family here, they wouldn't be alone anymore. Yangyang also tells Lin Yan that Jicai even had an outfit ready for Lin Yan. \n\nLin Yan is very happy and accepts the invitation. \n\nThat night, Jicai can't concentrate on work and her mind keeps diverting to wonder about Lin Yan.\n\nOn the day of the New Year, they Shen Family decorates their diner. Lin Yan and Liu Chang were also there, and Jicai was away to bring supplies. Just when Lin Yan asks if she was returning that day, and if he should go and bring her. However, she arrives, with water shield all the way from Qingyang (just for Lin Yan!). The people in Qingyang made dumplings with the filling. \n\nLin Yan's heart flutters hearing that she had gone to Qingyang just to get the water shield and worries if she fell in danger. However, Jicai mentions she was very careful and went through the mountains. \n\nThis makes Lin Yan feel very touched and even thanks her. The Shen family notices and interferes that it was just on the way. But Liu Chang makes point by saying since she went through the mountains, it wasn;t easy to get them (point noted!! xD )\n\nLin Yan swells with happiness, while Jicai flees. \n\nThat's all for today! WHen things are too sweet, the sadness follow! I suppose the angst isn't too far away! How did you all like the episodes so far? ",

I am glad I finally got to say that.\n\nEpisode 22 starts with Bozai winning the fight against Hanfeng, trussing him up like a meat dumpling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9aartxuly0wf1.jpg?width=1630&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4379640541288a812ba9d285a0878fc60f2e921\n\nBut when he goes outside to help Ming Yi and the others fight the netherbeast, he finds the immortals on the verge of losing and being devoured by the beast’s big maw.\n\nWas that Ming Xian’s brother with the blood moon ring?  And what does it do?\n\nAlso, was it Sun Liao that released Tianji from her bonds?  Didn’t he help Hanfeng raise the netherbeast? Did he not think this was going to happen? I do hope we won’t see much more of this guy.  Sun Liao‘s redemption arc is not on my **Love in the Clouds** bingo card.\n\nEither way, like Ming Yi says, there is really only one thing they can do… So Ming Yi and Bozai forms the hearbound array, a hokey gimmick that feels like it was lifted straight out of a Shaw Brothers movie circa 1980. But it does vanquish the netherbeast, and it allows our leads to look at each other trustingly and spout cheesy lines about their feelings being true and living and dying together. So I am happy to see it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi34g2esy0wf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a79814f49c0e45f9dc3f944d3ea1b1189d2414c6\n\nAnd the icing on the cake is that it finally allows Situ Ling to see the depth of their feeling for each other.  I hope.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o06vbj90z0wf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a1ddb19e8c2529f419dad9fc3219d87e9a9c54e\n\nWhile all this is going on, the emperor is having a heart-to-heart with his errant brother, who still maintains that he’s doing what’s best for Jixing Abyss. But then he loses control of the netherbeast and the backlash ends up…devouring him?…scattering his soul?  In either case, our megalomaniac dissolves into tiny sparkles in front of his distraught older brother. And I think we are finally rid of evil Lord Hanfeng for good. But if this is the price of commanding the netherbeast, doesn’t that mean his dream of ruling Jixing Abyss was always going to be a pipe dream? Or did he just not do his research? I swear…sometimes it feels like the writers are just making things up as they go along.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/toat6ntez0wf1.jpg?width=1630&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7529a05b21767c906efd3c779edd3bd52d565eaf\n\nBut the important thing is that all’s well that ends well. And the realm gets to enjoy the rest of the Prayer Day and eat, drink, and be merry.\n\n# Ming Yi’s dilemma\n\nNow that they have successfully performed the heartbound array, Bozai trusts Ming Yi more than ever. But he also recognizes that Ming Yi has her past and secrets, so he’s giving her three days to decide if she wants to stay and be with him.\n\nBut even as he is reluctant to keep Ming Yi by his side against her will, he is pulling out all the stops to let her know she’s valued and trusted.\n\n❤️He tells her about how Bo Yulan became his master and saved him with the Golden Millet Dream.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wbo1yubp01wf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2a78e4eb1210b81a42b6f933074c1236de2ab74\n\n❤️He introduces her to his master as “my wife”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9y7jn2wq01wf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a04b2327663eebcda4d4713303e9a5e6cd4247f\n\n❤️He removes the blood seal on the Golden Millet Dream. This is HUGE.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8yfro6xs01wf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f784f89c32cca7fdb94f0c2398a63573f2cbacb\n\n❤️He drinks from the jug of wine she gave him way back when.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1kn1uku01wf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2f7e6b3094266778f835b9cc5d8c752d8cc42a4\n\nAnd the problem is that the more he trusts her, the harder it is for her to tell him the truth, which I totally get. If she tells him now, he’ll think she’s only with him for the Golden Millet Dream. And she cares about him too much now to hurt him and can’t bear to have him think less of her.\n\nAnd just what exactly did she put in the wine?\n\nOh, it doesn’t matter, because she tell him that at that moment she is sincere, and the next moment, the two have made it back to Wugui Sea to engage in some recreational activities. And all I can say is…wow…\n\nI don’t know if it is the direction or the actors. But they’ve got every detail - the placement of their hands, the tiny breadth she takes, her rosy cheeked makeup, the contrast between his black robe and her white one - right. The way he asks her to say his name and then waits expectantly for her to say it again before kissing her is both sensual and playful. And I haven’t even mentioned the way he kissed away her tears and…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8zwsbe2y0wf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81c2949265827195230ff009d3a5ac99d34b1ccc\n\nHum..since I am obviously really enjoying this, then why do I feel like I have something squeezing against my chest the entire time?  Because we all know what is coming next.  Betrayal.  Heartbreak. And if I wasn’t writing this damn recap, I would probably fast-forward or skip the next thirty minute altogether.\n\n# Ming Yi’s betrayal? Sacrifice? Or is it noble idiocy?\n\nBecause one of the reason Ming Yi can’t get herself to ask Bozai for the Golden Millet Dream is because she doesn’t want to put him in the position of having to break his promise to his master. So she would rather commit an act of betrayal knowing he would hate her for it.\n\nInside Bozai’s spirit well, she sees that Bozai has made the Golden Millet Dream look like “my heart’s desire”, the jug of wine she gave him.\n\nBut when she picks it up, everything in his spirit well starts burning. And he was there, with betrayal in his eyes, asking her if it was all just for the Golden Millet Dream, and if she was lying to him all along.  She says “yes”.\n\nShe also used up her last lifeline/petal to save Er Shi Qi.\n\n(Hum…a few questions.  I really don’t get why the place burned up, to be honest. Did he put in a trigger to prevent others from getting the Golden Millet Dream?  But if he truly trusted Ming Yi, why would the trigger still be in place? And what is it that he dug out of his chest after Ming Yi left?  Maybe my fellow watchers who are smarter than me can enlighten me.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cm1ivgva21wf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9737beaee78ea844626ffc8220e04ef88a305f1\n\nSo Er Shi Qi gives up his life to give her a chance to live, if only it’s for a few days. This…is…even…worse..than I possibly could have imagined.\n\nAnd Lu Yu Xiao gave such a bravura performance I am in awe.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dahy0c9o31wf1.jpg?width=1632&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a50154c9fe23936d020bc3863015bb9f9cbc02\n\nIn the end, it is Situ Ling who finds her and takes her away. He also collected the sparkles that used to be Er Shi Qi.  So there is still a chance to our beloved kitty to come back, I hope?\n\nBack at Zhang Tai’s place(?), Situ Ling summons Ming Yi’s master, who tells her that Zhuoshui Spiritual State’s secret technique can suppress the Heavenly Grief.  Guess who is from Zhushui Spiritual State?  So Situ Ling cuts his hand, sends some spiritual energy into Ming Yi’s spiritual vein, and Ming Yi’s gets to live at least for another few days. But when Situ Ling says he’s going to ask Bozai for the Golden Millet Dream, Ming Yi tells him that Bozai never had the antidote, and that he only says he has to lure people who covets it into a trap.  Is that true?  If it is, I admit that I missed that memo.\n\nAnd I must say, Ming Yi accusing Situ Ling of not telling the truth about his identity is the height of irony.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h32y5mpjd1wf1.jpg?width=2444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=858a676341485d8ae77003a1fc999b91be7f7b1f\n\n# In other news…\n\nTianji held court with her subjects at the Prayer Day festival. The women of the realm are happy that they will no longer be subjected to the soul-hiding nails and can freely use their spiritual veins. And Yan Xiao secretly conjures up some glowing snow to make her happy.\n\nWhile I am all for reforming laws that are unfair against women, it just seems too easy. If she has the ability to simply remove the mandate for soul-hiding-nails, then why did it take so long for her or anyone to get rid of this chauvinistic law?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ya7c9e8s31wf1.jpg?width=1637&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=963d9ea909919b39f07c508048fe4ba7a9ad8f9d\n\nAnyways, later, Tianji discovers that Yan Xiao has been feeding the plant her mother left her with his own blood. She scolded him for always keeping her in the dark.  He apologies for never asking her what it is that she wants.  And just like that, the two have made up. I wanted to like this couple, I really do.  But after setting this relationship to be kind of an enemies-to-lovers courtship, this is a bit anticlimactic.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqf25c8k71wf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87967b3aeb658e68e12b5c5bd5eb96f4c46c5eda\n\nI guess Prayer Day really is a lucky occasion, because fortune also smiled upon Zhang Tai, who met a nice young man when a bully tries to harass her.  His name is Zheng Tiao and he comes from the Flowing Wave Gorge.\n\n[This is the type of drama in which even an extra is not bad looking. ](https://preview.redd.it/pegpudwu31wf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbdb6a0a8827a111062a574fd341cef2124c9ada)\n\n# Another observation\n\nHow presumptuous was it of Situ Ling to send Ming Yi a note saying that he’s busy and hope to spend future Prayer Days with her as if he has any claims on her. And Bozai is pretty chill about it, indicating that he considers the younger guy no threat to him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxk3o59nb1wf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=423314b2bd526d8718c23e815596ab3692679bff\n\n# Phew…\n\nSo what do you all think?  I know that one debate that has raged on since **Love in the Cloud** started is whether Ming Yi should have come clean to Bozai at several points in the drama. While I haven’t always been on her side, I understand why she did what she did here and her reasons actually worked for me. So this episode was FIRE!  The fact that her decision ended up costing Er Shi Qi his life is unfortunate, and this will probably further complicate any possibility of a reconciliation between Ming Yi and Bozai. But I trust the writers in being able to find a way to right the ship.\n\nAlright.  That’s it for now.  Let the rantings and ravings begin.",

    "title": "Review of \"Sound of Silence,\" Tan Jianci's new movie",
    "content": "MyDramaList Page\nhttps://mydramalist.com/779668-zhen-er-yu-long\n\nLink to my review on MyDramaList\nhttps://mydramalist.com/profile/scarletfray/review/502992\n\n\nI was incredibly excited to be able to see Tan Jianci in a movie theatre on the big screen and was not disappointed. I went with my partner who is not someone who interacts with Chinese entertainment (except through me) and he was also very impressed with the story and acting. I'm thrilled to have gotten the experience and to be able to write this review.\n\nTJC plays Li Qi, a lawyer who just wanted to rise above his circumstances. But it's not a kind world for a hearing child with deaf parents (known as CODA) who grew up bullied and in poverty. TJC did a stunning job getting across his struggles between trying to be a good human, who remembers and honors his roots, and his exhaustion with a world that has always pushed him down and never had open doors for him. I'm especially blown away by how adept he seemed at sign language. He looked natural and gave so much emotion through his nonverbal speech.\n\nThe main role of Zhang Xiaorui (portrayed by Lan Xiya) was also immensely impressive and moving. Xiaorui is a young deaf woman with the cards stacked against her, but a strong will and an unwillingness to give up or compromise her values. Her scenes with Li Qi were heartfelt and poignant. The juxtaposition of two people from similar backgrounds who clash on their values and approach really helped move the story along in character growth and motivations. Again, the comfort in which the actress used sign language spoke volumes (even when the sound was often muted for effect!) as to the quality of the production, direction, and acting.\n\nAn incredibly important shout out also needs to be given to the deep supporting cast of deaf actors. Their stories were equally moving and believable. It is a thoughtful look into the lives of a community that is close knit, but very much disadvantaged and oppressed. I felt that the movie really did a great job highlighting the plight of a marginalized community that falls through the cracks of societal support and is easy prey for those with bad intentions.\n\nI think my only complaint (and why I give this movie a 9.5 instead of a perfect 10) is that the villain, in trying to tell a complex story in 2 hours runtime, lacked depth compared to the rest of the story. I thought his motivations and actions were believable, but the portrayal was almost comical in the lack of nuance. The metaphorical moustache twirling from the antagonist felt contrived when the acting and story were generally so full of thoughtfulness.\n\nThe cinematography and sound design deserve a special shout out. The beautifully filmed scenes of a community mired in adversity conveyed much grit but also grim determination. In contrast, the scenes of glitz and glamour gave a sense of the fleetingness and shallowness of eschewing one's morals. The use of music, but especially the use of silence, was phenomenal. It all helped land the beats of this thoughtful story.\n\nIf it's at a theatre near you, I highly recommend you take the opportunity to see it. I will say, however, that the subtitles are not as polished as I would have liked. An important note is that the use of the word \"dumb\" refers to the fairly outdated use of the word to refer to people who are mute. And there was definitely at least one typo. But otherwise, I'm just overcome with joy that I was able to see it in a theatre.\n\nI have added the images that have theatres showing the movie. Hope some of you can see it for yourselves!",

After hearing about Hanfeng’s kidnapping of Ming Yi, Tianji decides that it’s time to get rid of uncle dearest once and for all. But in order to do that, she will need to wake up her father the emperor.\n\nSo she has Yan Xiao brought to her in the middle of the night, dressed in her guaziest fineries, and tries to steal the contraption that Yan Xiao uses to keep her father in a deep slumber.  Yan Xiao catches onto her pretty quickly, of course, but eventually agrees to let her borrow the contraption for a few days.\n\nI have to hand it to Tianji. This is one woman who is willing to use everything in her arsenal to get what she wants.  In the space of a few minutes, we see her seduce, cajole, threaten, beg, cry, and eventually wear Yan Xiao down with a tearily-uttered “言哥哥 (Yan gege)”.  I am torn between wanting to applaud her and trying not to grow goosebumps.\n\n(哥哥 (gege): older brother, or an endearment for a boyfriend or a flirtatious nickname for a man who is not a sibling.\n\n[I must say that Tianji looks fantastic in this scene.](https://preview.redd.it/qxz5tmw1wyvf1.jpg?width=2433&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a36a1cbcc8b746cda242b2302525e47dde2a9fe)\n\nOne the emperor is awake, Tianji and Bozai wastes no time in convincing the emperor to arrest Mu Qibai. Seriously, the emperor hemmed and hawed so much that I actually started wondering if Mu Qibai has a point when he said that the emperor is unfit to be the ruler of Jixing Abyss.\n\nExcept they aren’t able to keep Lord Hanfeng confined for long. Hanfeng manages to escape in no time, and our ever resourceful princess summons Yan Xiao again, hoping that he will betray Hanfeng and tell her where Hanfeng is hiding.\n\nBut now that Hanfeng is no longer in power and can give Yan Xiao the prestige that he craves, he suggests that Tianji marry him. Tianji is looking for a husband that can help her retain control of Jixing Abyss, he reasoned, so why shouldn’t it be him? But when Tianji calls him out on his dare and kisses him, he gets mad because she is willing to sell herself out to anyone. Um…weren’t you the one who suggested marriage just a minute ago?  Either way, Yanqiu then arrives and punches Yan Xiao in the face. Yan Xiao suggests that Tianji marry Yanqiu instead. And I am left shaking my head. Seriously, these two both fascinate and exhaust me in equal measures.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8x2718l5wyvf1.jpg?width=2407&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca11f87716910b0c3dcab27029e5ae3146ce3ce\n\n# Lord Hanfeng stages a coup\n\nI had wondered who will back Hanfeng now that Chao Yu is dead, but I needn’t have worried. Because Hanfeng has an ace up his sleeve.  He has secretly kept a netherbeast, and Shao Qun has been raising it using his own flesh and blood even as he languished in prison all this time. Shao Qun also helps Hanfeng escape from prison, and sacrifices himself in order to release the netherbeast.\n\n[Is it wrong for me to say that I will miss Shao Qun?  Like most men in this drama, he’s quite easy on the eyes…](https://preview.redd.it/wt9yqep8wyvf1.jpg?width=2422&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e30c24e8561bb983610fe06fba5452859347edad)\n\nFinally catching on to Hanfeng’s plan, Ming Yi offers to make netherbeast-repelling umbrellas to help keep the citizens of Jixing Abyss safe. When she saw Bozai watching her making the umbrellas, she gets so flustered that she drops an umbrella on her foot (Cute! Bozai seems to think so too…).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10q4ecbfwyvf1.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5adc3f79ede5eaa3388bbecd91f85b2e415c38\n\nBut later, when she asks Bozai for Ember back, because it is also a very useful netherbeast repelling tool, Bozai is not so amused anymore. He is still jealous of Ming Yi’s alter-ego it seems. He points out that they are legitimate husband and wife with their names on the marriage stone (hum…you seem to be forgetting something here Bozai…), which leads to an exchange that may very well be a confession from both sides:\n\n(For a minute, I thought Ming Yi the heartless minx wasn’t going to turn around.  Thank god she did…\n\n[Bozai: “You better be prepared. If I survive, you will not be able to escape from me.” Ming Yi: “What if we protect each other by practicing the hearbond array that only people who are deeply in love with each other will be able to master or risk getting burned alive?” Ok. I am totally paraphrasing here but you get the gist.](https://preview.redd.it/6tsxd9miwyvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbc3e102421e0e37f25ed79b479fbcdf6c4aece2)\n\nAnyway, I digress. It turns out that Yan Xiao had followed Hanfeng’s directive and poisoned the emperor after all. So when the emperor led everyone in a prayer ceremony on Prayer Day, his tainted spiritual energy ends up poisoning everyone. And that’s when Hanfeng shows up to force the emperor to sign the abdication decree.\n\n(Why do I see Yan Xiao and Sun Liao in the prayer ceremony?  Aren’t then known Hanfeng sympathizers? And if they get to pray with the emperor, why isn’t Situ Ling there? Plot holes, plot holes…)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzcw2ofmwyvf1.jpg?width=2450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c0bab0e875ac97053a92d18172935e28b142b75\n\nAnyways.  Psych. Haha. Because everyone has NOT been poisoned. In another twist, Yan Xiao had teamed up with Bozai to fool Hanfeng into thinking that everyone has been poisoned. Bozai then fights Hanfang while Ming Yi leads everyone else in a fight against the netherbeasts using the netherbeast-repelling umbrellas.  Who will come out on top? I guess we’ll have to wait until the next episode to find out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ya4fvfowyvf1.jpg?width=1640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c99cd9512661275b9b6dd1a1dd6f0e9489117ce\n\n# A few notes on our not-quite-husband-and-wife\n\nEven though we did not spend all the much time with our lead couple in these episodes, I think their relationship did progress somewhat. Ming Yi, at least, has admitted that she’s in love with Bozai, even though she still thinks that their relationship is doomed. My heart broke for her when she cried thinking about their eventual parting.  And I am also conflicted about the conflicting advice Er Shi Qi and Zhang Tai gave her:\n\n[“Ming Yi. No matter how much you like him, you cannot waver.  You have only one life.”](https://preview.redd.it/yi9u9zbswyvf1.jpg?width=1656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=107d2be2ca41f638318472c059059cbc53604590)\n\n[“But Ming Yi.  Moments of happiness are rare.  Even if you have part ways in the future, when you see him now, isn’t your heart full of joy?” ](https://preview.redd.it/ktjvoeqxwyvf1.jpg?width=1652&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a36f0d49184f07ed98c5a066f236677b19d4bb3)\n\nAnd then look at each other across the street, and I am grinning like an idiot. Bozai is practically wearing his heart on his sleeves during these episodes, and I am all for it.\n\n[”I no longer care about her past, as long as she truly cares about me…”](https://preview.redd.it/t09w3rw6xyvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a225a1b52e5ea683877d70e6c206afa55e5e4afb)\n\nUnfortunately, you will care about her past &lt;sigh&gt;…\n\n# The dynamic duo\n\nThe funniest moments of the episodes still belong to our favorite dragon and kitty companions.\n\n[“His lordship took your lord’s fiancée to the hot spring last night to heel and keep warm. Instead of chatting her, you better keep a look out. Or risk your lord getting cheated on.” ](https://preview.redd.it/oziut8k1vyvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53a2985a2df78014eed9d9755e2d38fbacd52b36)\n\nIt took me a minute to register what Buxiu even said, because I had forgotten about Ming Yi’s ruse as Ming Xian’s fiancée.\n\n[“Your master fell in love first. She seems to have forgotten she has a fiance.” “No, your master developed feelings first.  Look at him, he’s shameless.” “No, she did it first.” No, it was him.” “Oh, shut up you two,” says Nanny Moth. ](https://preview.redd.it/7uljacbovyvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39908836fd6b9d1348f2eca62c8ae6f236641996)\n\nSo it’s another two entertaining episode in the books. Next up - will we finally get a glimpse of the power couple that Ming Yi and Bozai could be? Let’s hope so.  In the meantime, let me know what you think in the comments below.",

I was missing out lol. I admit that I didn't watch historical/fantasy cdramas because of Love Between Fairy and Devil. That was the first non-contemporary cdrama that I watched and the FL there was really not for me and I dropped it very early on. Should I give it another chance? Was I too quick to give up on it? A Dream within a Dream is making me consider giving it another chance.\n\nBack to A Dream within a Dream, I just loved everything about it. I can't even think of a negative right now. Maybe it dragged a bit during the second half, but nothing too annoying. I loved the story, I loved the tone of the drama and I LOVED the 2 main characters and actors as well. Song Yi Meng is now genuinely one of my favourite female leads ever. I am a sucker for an enemies to lovers story and this one delivered perfectly.\n\nI haven't seen the main actress in anything else so she was unfamiliar to me, but I'll be sure to have a look at her previous dramas because I loved her so much. Same with the main actor, I knew of his existence but his most popular dramas are historical so again I hadn't seen him in anything else before. Now, I'm very interested in watching more from him, he was amazing! They both managed to do justice to the comedy bits as well as the dramatic and more serious bits. I just loved them so much! \n\nThe supporting characters also worked perfectly. It's been a while since I enjoyed so many characters in a drama. Usually there's always characters that I just can't be bothered with because they bore me, but I feel like everyone was interesting here and the actors all did a good job. \n\nI'm also happy that they managed to finish it on a satisfying note and yeah, I loved this so much that I wanted to share. \n\n\n\n",

Episode 19 starts off with Ming Yin looking for her bestie and getting sucked into a cave through a portal. There she finds Zhang Tai, helps Er Shi Qi (where’d he come from?) escape with Zhang Tai, and ends up being captured herself in the process. \n\nIt’s worth noting that Hanfeng and his henchmen are only able to spring the trap after finding a bell that Zhang Tai uses to communicate with Ming Yi.  Zhang Tai never gave up her best friend. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50war80lzrvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fb91ec543fe101f264b69d072f7cadfac2a4e10\n\nThe purpose of capturing her, of course, is to get her to disclose where Ji Bozai and the Golden Millet Dream are. Lord Hanfeng and Sun Liao the cowardly footstool sends a few nails through Ming Yi.  And when that didn’t work, Hanfeng uses the Soul-Seizing spell on her. The spell causes Ming Yi to re-live one of her most painful memories - being locked up by her mother because (I presume) she didn’t win a tournament. But even then, Ming Yi stands firm and never give up Bozai’s or the Golden Millet Dream’s location.  She stays in control by pushing a nail through her own hand. \n\nShe also utters the line “No one would sacrifice themselves for another“ as if she meant it (we all know she’s lying…) Even Hanfeng is convinced by the end that maybe she didn’t know where the Golden Millet Dream is. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/94kiey3szrvf1.jpg?width=2440&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=886af34c53dcbfd5b5640991feb0e518d12d9b17\n\nWhile Ming Yi is being tortured, Chao Yu’s got his little brother chained up like a dog on the other side of the cave and looking in on what’s happening behind an invisible barrier. Situ Ling keeps on begging his brother to let Ming Yi go, which is…kind of sweet and pathetic at the same time. Also, I am kind of surprised that Situ Ling didn’t blurt out what he knows about Bozai’s spirit well to save Ming Yi. \n\nBut then Situ Ling pulls a surprise and actually manages to kill his sadistic brother using Ming Yi’s hairpin.  I must say that I find the moment immensely satisfying…But are we getting a glimpse of the beginning of Situ Ling’s heel turn? \n\nWho will back Lord Hanfeng’s criminal enterprise now? \n\n[I am a sucker for the blood-splattered, unhinged look. ](https://preview.redd.it/z37dl3o00svf1.jpg?width=2453&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4330be408b7ac1a4b11afa1d86c8db96cb51bb8)\n\n# Call of the Heart Imprint\n\nIn Bozai’s spirit well, an ivory-haired hottie is busy battling his netherbeast core. But then he feels his beloved’s pain, and rushes out to save her, getting almost consumed by the netherbeast in the process.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2qz2orh30svf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cebd24c5624849edfe9dce28f868cddde85640b5\n\nBut then he sees Ming Yi calling out to him, telling him not to give in. And he sees the soul-seizing spell talisman and Ming Yi’s bloodied hand, and pulls himself *back from the brink*.  That one look must have told him what Ming Yi went through for him.  And then a single tear rolls down his cheek and I about melt into a puddle on the floor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9t16yyly0svf1.jpg?width=2446&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a110a85aadb63df05643df928cb40b4ee8513e7\n\nSo Bozai successfully refines the netherbeasts.  And he tells Ming Yi that he’s taking her home.  No...I’m not crying.  You are crying.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk1mdln01svf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f73043e04f9b66441307ddb460da2cd30ac3687f\n\n# And Then…\n\nI am sorry, but my brain is too addled to think of a clever title right now.  In either case, Bozai takes Ming Yi home and tends to her wounds in a bathing pool.\n\n[Why a bathing pool is required I’ll never know.  But I’m not complaining…](https://preview.redd.it/oj3zfft90svf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e4795f42947ee418209c6603b261932df3991f1)\n\nMing Yi then starts hugging him and kissing him because she’s cold…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5f4w8s3p0svf1.jpg?width=2424&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7132b62548a9aabdcfdc1d7fa21bc34c839df8e9\n\nBut our green-flag hero is too much of a gentleman to take advantage of a lady in an inebriated state. He manages to keep himself in check and pushes her away. \n\nBut then Ming Yi, still under the influence of the soul-seizing spell, starts spelling all kinds of delicious truths (I only have you in my heart!), and that turns out too much for our hero to resist. And just like that, our hero and heroine are all over each other. \n\nAnd Bozai utters the best line of the night: “Look closely.  I am the one in front of you. It can only be me.”  (That thud you hear is me swooning and dropping onto the floor.) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98mira3u0svf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e87a66de9f5403369e90a80c2bcd7523d83f315b\n\nDo I kind of wish that Ming Yi had confessed under her own free will, maybe. But am I still glad that the confession happened?  Absolutely. \n\nSo finally, our hero and heroine steps over the threshold into couplehood…maybe? We may still need to wait a bit, since Ming Yi does not seem to be ready, as she quickly runs away after she “wakes up” and realizes what they have done. Understandable, given that she’s the only one who knows what obstacles stand between them. But I hope that the two have at least put the play-acting behind them, so that they can move forward from a place of sincerity and trust. \n\n[What is he feeling right now watching Ming Yi run away from him?  ](https://preview.redd.it/2ve4hvru1svf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ea59afc73354d7b7793d05e656eba5992e0b34f)\n\n# Another notable moment…\n\nBefore I sign off for the night, I do want to call out our favorite dynamic duo.  How sweet was it of Buxiu to come to Er Shi Qi’s aid? And even though 27 was clearly distraught and worried about Ming Yi, he didn’t let that override his reason and do something to jeopardize Bozai’s efforts to refine the netherbeasts. As Nanny Moth said…those two kids were raised well…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ur9euu51svf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05e1aca5ee54dd6202cd09b29ac82fd718468807\n\n# So there we have it. \n\nFor me, this was an immensely satisfying episode. We saw a villain die, glimpsed a character’s darker side, and witnessed some bathing pool action.  I can’t wait to see what this drama has in store for us next. \n\nLet me know what you all think in the comments below. ",

    "content": "#First Thing First\n\n*Fated Hearts* has a lovely set of [episode discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/s/0gPhkwcUAO) hosted by the u/Emotional-Vegetable, u/AirRealistic1112 and u/Lotus_Swimmer.\n\nThere is nothing I can say here that has not been covered there, and I would suggest for anyone reading this to go pop in and look at those discussions.\n\n#Fated Hearts 一笑随歌\n\n[Fated Hearts](https://mydramalist.com/768987-wan-xin-ji) aired from the 2nd of October to the 16th of October 2025. \n\nIt stars [Li Qin](https://mydramalist.com/people/6504-li-qin) as Fu Yixiao and [Chen Zhe Yuan](https://mydramalist.com/people/14352-chen-zhe-yuan) as Feng Suige. \n\nYixiao is a key part of the Jinxiu Kingdom's army, and is known for her unrivalled archery skills. \n\nSuige is the first prince of Susha - Jinxiu's rival nation, and is known as Susha's \"God of Death\".\n\nAt the start of the drama Fu Yixiao almost kills Feng Suige with a fatally-aimed arrow. He manages to survive by the skin of his teeth and ends up finding an injured (and some what forgetful) Fu Yixiao. It turns out Yixiao has lost her memories after \"falling\" off a cliff (after being shot in the shoulder). Her only clue as to who could have done this to her is that it had to have been someone she trusted deeply - due to how close the culprit had to stand in order to shoot her the way they did.\n\nThe two team up, fall in love, and just generally kick ass. \n\n#Ruminations \n\nIt's good. \n\nIt. Is. Really. Good.\n\nIt's been a while since I've watched a drama where I wake up craving another episode.\n\nThe music is used beautifully. \n\nThe actors are masters of their craft. (Most of them).\n\nAnd the characters are the perfect amount of insane and lovable. \n\nWhen I reference the actors, I want to point out that there is a spot somewhere in the middle of the drama where a few key characters have monologues that just blow you away. The amount of emotion behind each sentence sucks you in so much that you finish an episode with your heart beating rapidly and your mind racing. \n\nI'm still busy dealing with my racing heart.\n\nThere are so many things I could rave about and analyse and criticise and gush over, but I think I'll leave my ruminations here.\n\nTo those who have finished the drama: One thing, the only thing, that bothers me &gt;!WHY DID NO ONE TELL NING FEI AND XIAO WEI RAN THAT XIA JING SHI WAS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH CAMPS IN THE FIRST PLACE?!&lt;\n\n#The GIFs\n\nAs always, feel free to use these whenever and wherever you want. There is no need to add credit, except if you are using the GIFs in a separate post (then just add credit).\n\n",

    "content": "Fun Fact: Tanghulu 糖葫芦 is a traditional Chinese dessert/snack dating back to the Song Dynasty.  The story goes, Emperor Song Guangzong's concubine Huang Guifei got sick and was on her deathbed and refused to eat or drink.  The Emperor basically gathered as many physicians as he could to try and cure her...one day a doctor came and had the kitchen make hawthorn with rock sugar and prescribed her eat a few of these before each meal, within a few days she got better.  Eventually it was sold on bamboo skewers and became a very popular street snack/dessert. Has anyone tried it?  I'm curious to try it with actual hawthorns but also grapes or strawberries. \n\nSmall Fun Fact 2: Hawthorns help with digestion by breaking down food... so maybe the physician might have been on to something \n\nSorry this is a bit late, busy day.

    "content": "Spoilers for express package ahead.\n\nI loved Fated Hearts. It is not perfect but personally its damn close.\n\nOne thing I've noticed in a lot of reviews on multiple platforms is how everyone seems unanimous in praising Qin TianYu for his role as the Emperor of Jinxiu. A character that, if overplayed, would become a caricature and clown, ended up being a favorite must watch character with scenes that stay in our minds.\n\nThe last bit of the show was dominated (in terms of lasting impression) by the Jinxiu plot and a lot of it is due to Qin TianYu acting. To me he managed to convey so many different emotions in one scene and did it well.\n\nStanding up to his mother was a mix of unhinged, pride and desperate need of love and attention. The final scenes was top tier, goind from regal pride to desperate need to save the woman he loved/admired and his unborn child. The character was just so much \"fun\" to watch, completly unhinged and psychopath but with a constant underlying sadness.\n\nI just loved every scene he was in and think his expressions were always on point. He was expressive! I dont know if he did his own voice acting (it isn't available on drama list) but regardless his body language and face really made the character work. \n\nOf course his good looks helped, but good looks alone wouldn't make this character work as it didn't for his brother on the show...👀 \n\nIt happens more often than expected that the second couple draws more attention than the first couple at a certain point. However Qin Tianyu isn't even the second lead (and wasn't a part of the 4 that promoted the show), so for him to command this much attention/interest from the viewers is impressive.\n\nI don't know if I am alone in this.. I will definitely check his short drama. \n\nAnother example for me of a character done well that made me curious of the actors other works was for example in The Wanted Detective Deng Kai role. I ended up watching his short drama The Maid and loved it. \n\nEdit: Thank you to Beautiful_Candle1729! I finally found how to edit the post and fix Qin Tianyu's name (exception made for the title, which can't be changed)",

I will be posting the recap for that episode in just a few hours.\n\nIn the meantime, hopefully this will tie us over until then.\n\n | [Episodes 1 - 5 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o2r9tt/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_1_5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)| [Episodes 6 - 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o3ijm7/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_6_7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) | [Episodes 8 - 9 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o43xua/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_8_9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)| [Episodes 10 - 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o5ajyo/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_10/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) | [Episodes 12 - 14 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o6qxp0/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_12/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)| [Episodes 15 - 16](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o7mske/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_15/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) |\n\n# Refining the netherbeast\n\nThe third and final step to refining the netherbeast requires that the vessel absorbs the ugly critters’ primordial spirits into his body and refine them for seven days. During this time, he will feel immense pain and face his most painful memories. If he cannot subdue his inner demons, he will lose control of himself and be taken over by the netherbeasts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96h5q7y2kpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=203666fdff20e664acf7d0a2603718642c896ab4\n\nSo what is Bozai’s most painful memory? We see that while he was in the Sunken Abyss, a woman approaches Bozai and tells him that he resembles her dead son.  She gives him a morsel of food and asks for his handprint on a piece of cloth, which immediately raised a siren in my head. A handprint?  Who asks for handprint? But naive and trusting Bozai didn’t suspect anything. And that is how a cloth with his handprint ended up next to a foreman after he was beaten up by some unknown assailant. It turns out that Lord Hanfeng‘s henchmen were looking to assign someone to drug refining duty. The woman didn’t want her own son selected, so she came up with the idea of framing Bozai for the assault, which earned Bozai both a beating and an assignment to the drug refining detail.\n\nHer parting words to him? “I’m sorry, child. It’s either you or my son. Don’t trust others in the future.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwbvkga6kpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=025540df771344f1e4e8bf0f328e885fe2a0bbac\n\nBoy, if only she could see him now.  And given his past experiences, I am surprised that Ming Yi was able to earn his trust so easily, not once but twice..Ji Bozai may try to pull off the cold, aloof CEO archetype, but he’s really just a big softie inside…\n\nLater, Bozai escapes and kills the foreman with the skull of someone’s hand.  Poetic justice I would say.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xl5jmg49kpvf1.jpg?width=2431&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=617951928ecf82168d664c16890b7f3d217ef265\n\n# The Princess’s Gambit\n\nWhile Bozai remains in seclusion, doing a real hero’s work, newly-minted Qingyun warrior Sun Liao earns the ire of everyone at Shuohua Academy by bossing his lesser accomplished teammates around. His long suffering teammates rigs a contraption that dumps a bucket of water on him, Yan Xiao tells him that the water contains poison and gives him an antidote, and the arrogant nitwit gets laid up with diarrhea for three days.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o5oqtx0ckpvf1.jpg?width=2413&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f5cf9fec00ea2d79b47d0342727321611d3c2da\n\nBut this is all falls within Tianji’s plan, you see, because now she’s got Sun Liao off her back and he’s so busy that he’s been neglecting his duties as Lord Hanfeng’s lapdog. All of her maneuvering has not been lost on Ming Yi, who assures Tianji that she sees and appreciates her efforts. I look forward to seeing this budding friendship blossom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3rfu96ekpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47d5ddb7ac5c9f0d568ffd29bdab4f03459bde19\n\nUnfortunately, equally astute is Mu Qibai, who I think is not quite buying Yan Xiao’s I-am-loyal-only-to-you act, judging by this conversation.\n\n[“You know what your flaw is? Other people hide their black heart under morality and righteousness.  You seem like you want to climb up at any cost but is really not ruthless enough.  You want to much.”](https://preview.redd.it/y7scz5igkpvf1.jpg?width=2416&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eb0fc5d5cdb592009d40cc5528fffd6a5063393)\n\nI am starting to worry that all of Yan  Xiao’s sacrifice, because I refuse to believe he doesn’t have some ulterior motive for hanging around Hanfeng, will come to naught.\n\nAnd Hangfeng really needs a better posse. He’s got one guy whose loyalty is in question. Another guy who’s one card short of a full stack. And Sun Liao is…Sun Liao. We really shouldn’t worry too much about him.  He is destined to fail.\n\n# Springing the Trap\n\nMu Qibai tries once again to take control of the Shuohua Academy, but Bozai comes out of seclusion just in time to foil his plans. Um…so what happened to battling his inner demons?  I wish we had gotten to see more of how he put one over the netherbeasts.  He didn’t even take the 7 days that normal people would have taken.  Our pull-himself-up-by-the-bootstraps hero is such an over-achiever.\n\nAgain, I get a kick out of watching him hug his number on enemy and bragging about how the nether beasts are no match for his level of cultivation.\n\nBut the ultimate laugh belongs to Hanfeng for this round, I am afraid, because Meng Yanqiu, at Hanfeng’s instigation, plants a netherbeast luring caltrop in Bozai, causing Bozai to lose control.  The bad news? Now everyone thinks that Bozai is the one who has been raising netherbeasts.\n\n[“I thought you would remain unaffected.” Oh, shut up you himbo. ](https://preview.redd.it/hfr6z3opkpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8002ce760b729b2be70a690d616d2438950632fb)\n\nThe silver lining? A white haired Ji Bozai.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymc0vfstkpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3874732dc4b3be72de92ba33dfa620a47f596c2e\n\nAs Bozai flees back to his spirit well, a worried Ming Yi follows.  Even though that means Bozai will know that Ming Yi knows where his spirit well is, Ming Yi doesn’t care.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr9iis6vkpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd4ea6576382591d720bbad1524c5d1465bf102f\n\nShe uses the spiritual vein that she shouldn’t be using to dig the netherbeast core out of Bozai. Then follows Buxiu when the faithful dragon companion goes to stop Lord Hanfeng, who is putting together an army to come and arrest Bozai. Again, at the risk to herself, she uses spiritual energy to help Buxiu defeat Hanfeng. Situ Ling, who arrives a little later, chips in as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lo145o9wkpvf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b430e810b28cc8ad7778a80cc27aa35fb15bc168\n\n# Shadow of a doubt\n\nAfterwards, Ming Yi refuses to let a forlorn Situ Ling tend to her wounds so she can rush back to Bozai’s side.\n\nHaving been weakened by the netherbeast luring caltrop, Bozai is now trapped in a nightmare. Ming Yi falls asleep by his bedside.\n\nI love the way Bozai keeps on tugging at Ming Yi’s sleeves as if grabbing onto a lifeline. And when she wipes away his tears with her fingers. These two are all about the little gestures.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y4govufxkpvf1.jpg?width=1624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b597d65e3bef8f4f474b6728dd6e5211630f0383\n\nAftear Bozai wakes up, he caresses her face.  She grabs his hand and doesn’t let go immediately.  She’s got to be aware of her own feelings by now doesn’t she? But she’s not yet ready to face it, which I get. Bozai is ready though, as he asks Ming Yi why she doesn’t eliminate him as he’s still the biggest threat to Ming Xian.  He knows that she knows about his spirit where and where he’s hidden the Golden Millet Dreams.  He wants to know if she’ll will like to him in the future, and even flat out asks if her feelings for him are real.  Say yes girl!  Say yes!…But then they get interrupted, and in addition to being the villain, Lord Hanfeng decides to add c\\*ckblocker to his resume as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sceexaoykpvf1.jpg?width=2446&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6fd1fd17adb1483ca7cd73f718504b534c9a73ba\n\nLord Hanfeng arrives at the most inopportune moment to harass Bozai about raising a netherbeast army again.  Situ Ling comes up with the idea of using the caltrop to test Bozai again, but Bozai takes the plan even one step further by infusing the caltrop with netherbeast aura and sending it back to Hanfeng.  When Hanfeng touches it, netherbeast markings appear on his face. See! The problem is not Bozai, but the tainted caltrop!\n\nAnd thus Bozai was able to successfully cast doubt on his guilt and blames Hanfeng for framing him. Unfortunately, Hanfeng’s faithful lackey Shao Qun steps up to take the blame.  Do these nitwits buy it?  Doesn’t matter, as both Shao Qun and Yanqui ends up being taken back to the justice hall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lf55mf0lpvf1.jpg?width=2448&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf268b39065655d91614e471ba698f716772587e\n\nLord Hanfeng escapes yet again!  But how stupid is Yanqui because he still doesn’t appear to grasp the fact that he’s just been made a patsy? Yet the next moment, he seems all too aware of the kind of person Lord Hanfeng is. What I am more interested in, though, is seeing in a flashback how Hanfeng stood up for Yan Xiao when he was getting bullied. That’s how Yan Xiao ended up working for him? Does this mean Yan Xiao is not some noble sacrificial lamb paving the way for Tianji’s happiness? Oh writers.  Just put us out of our misery already.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lihh0643lpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=162cda35b86f0bac0375950c852f6125536a7c31\n\nDid Hanfeng really mean what he said about wanting Jixing Abyss and its inhabitants to rise above oppression and live free from humiliation? Perhaps back then. But the guy has somehow lost his way in pursuit of his lofty ideals.\n\n# Three’s a crowd\n\nWhile Bozai is back in seclusion, refining those god awful netherbeasts, our cute *didi* makes another move on his wife.\n\n[Ming Yi: “This is the second time you’ve helped me. How can I repay you?” Situ Ling: “You can give me your hand in marriage.” ](https://preview.redd.it/jetbl905lpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4234a953c2f3f92bcea2637a5f3dfc7ac8a37974)\n\nOK.  Call me shallow, because I still can’t get myself to be mad at this guy. But his refusal to see that Ming Yi does not regard Bozai just as a means to an end is starting to border on the delusional…He even removes a hairpin from Ming Yi’s hair to keep as souvenir. Isn’t that the one Bozai made for her?  I can’t believe that Ming Yi allowed it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/toqmni5clpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f6e5a04a16aaf1d3908cbf1df8e096632c09aa5\n\nAnd how funny is it that Bozai seems to sense it when someone tries to cuckold him.  He sneezed.\n\n[“Huh? What is happening?”](https://preview.redd.it/i5mywrtdlpvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=defd744615177c12a1d99ab3088270cccdc5a4d9)\n\nEpisode 18 ends with our villains kidnapping Zhang Tai to set up a trap for Ming Yi.  Situ Ling tries to kill his brother but ends up being captured and humiliated instead.  I am really beginning to hate Chao Yu even more than Hanfeng.  That guys is such a sadist.\n\nOk.  That’s all for now.  I’m now off to write the recap for the next episode, which should be up in a few hours.\n\nStay tuned!  And sound off in the comments below…",

I haven't fast forwarded this much either which is probably what has exacerbated my anger because I really want to love this drama and finish it but it just keeps pissing me off. Who the fuvk wrote this FL, Chu and Emperor's character? \nEven the ML acts like a total buffon way too many times because how are you letting yourself get bullied by literally everyone when you're the top martial artist of the country and hero that keeps saving the nation?! \nI know it's a drama but did they really need to make the story so stupid? Who would stick with that FL thru all that her BS or the fxcking emperor, I would've chased him off that throne a long time ago!! Don't even get me started on that dvmb incompetent goat named Chu\n\nIf you must watch this drama, do yourself a favor and Skip anything with the emperor and Chu and like 60% of all episodes involving the FL until atleast like episode 26 which is where am at. \n\nEdit to add: please don't tell me it's satire. If it didn't want to take itself serious then they should have left it as just a plain comedy with no serious story to it\n\nUpdate: From episode 33, i skipped and just watched the final episode and it doesn't seem like i missed anything",

Yixiao donning her trademark red garb to protect Suige/be his sniper support really got me in the feels. And as much as I love Song Yi, Li Qin really projected a more fierce warrior aura between our two female archers this year.\n\n[Ren Ruyi - A Journey to Love](https://preview.redd.it/yua2uysy5lvf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bd6783a77ba5235c891613cf9f71ab7a9eaf450)\n\nSome of Yixiao's fight scenes reminded me of Ren Ruyi, with some similar ass kicking. She seems to also prefer wearing red as she has a few outfits in that color scheme.\n\n[Shen Li - The Legend of Shen Li](https://preview.redd.it/59s24gw27lvf1.jpg?width=1329&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58a2c39f497b82cfffc8b3b90b264383d566130d)\n\nFemale leads in xianxia don't typically fit the warrior archetype, but Shen Li is a certified general who personally leads her troops into battle against the enemies of the spirit realm. Of course, as a &gt;!phoenix/firebird!&lt;, red is the perfect color to match her fiery nature.\n\n[Qiao Man - The Prisoner of Beauty](https://preview.redd.it/2ap4829q7lvf1.jpg?width=1472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3a686372fb2444bf5300a31c76f7fa4ac53af9b)\n\nHonorable mention #1 - Manman isn't a warrior, but she technically leads a detachment of troops into battle. The bright red was probably on purpose to make sure to capture the enemy's full attention.\n\n[Song Yimeng - A Dream within a Dream](https://preview.redd.it/thcmdou48lvf1.jpg?width=1747&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7fd4b9133cca5c9244fee3fe8ba11a6575b40be)\n\nHonorable mention #2 - Also not a warrior, but Yimeng deciding to pick up a sword and follow in Nan Heng's steps was probably her most awesome moment in the entire drama.",

    "title": "The Ingenious One is such a rare gem!",
    "content": "The writing is so clever, and I absolutely love the cast. It's so rare for me to find a drama with so many likeable characters - seriously, there are about 10 of them!\n\nI actually found this drama by chance. One day I saw my mom watching something, and I recognized Tiffany Tang, though I didn't even know what the drama was called. Then I noticed another actress with these huge, beautiful eyes - I got curious and found out she's Mao Xiao Tong. So I decided to randomly pick one of her dramas, and that's how I ended up watching The Ingenious One.\n\nI know she's not a top-tier actress, but I really like her. Just finished the last episode today, and I feel kinda sad that it's over. 😢",

    "content": "As we have new members joining all the time, and as we *still* get reports about spoilery posts, I think a weekly reminder about the importance of marking your posts with spoilers tags is in order.\n\nIf your post or comments contains discussions of major plot points (*especially about deaths and endings*), mark your post with spoiler tags or it will be removed. Here's how you do it.\n\n# On the Desktop\n\nThis will work in Fancy Pants Editor mode, so switch to the mode by clicking on the “Switch to Fancy Pants Editor” button located at the top right corner of the text box.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xb5ht42p3bc1.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43820119f41012eff0d33a811c7a1bbcb0ae9ab9\n\nTo mark your **entire post** as spoiler-y:\n\n1. At the bottom of the Fancy pants editor, click **+Spoiler**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgtt3rohp3bc1.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71e2c6a02fa6f7a902f3c320db9466bdb6851694\n\n**Note:** Your post will now have the symbol **Spoiler** next to the title. \n\nTo mark content on the text of your post body using the Fancy pants editor:\n\n1. Open the Reddit post you want to edit.\n2. Highlight the text you want to mark as a spoiler.\n3. Click on the **exclamation mark in a diamond** located in the top menu of the fancy pants editor.\n4. Click **Save** to save your changes.\n\n# Mobile\n\nTo mark your post as a spoiler:\n\n1. Tap on **Add tags &amp; flair (optional)**.\n2. Scroll down to **Universal tags** and toggle on the slider for **Spoiler**.\n3. Tap on **Apply (**at the top).\n\nTo mark a comment with spoiler tags:\n\nUse this syntax to mark spoilers on mobile: `&gt;!spoiler text!&lt;`\n\nThis will hide the text between the exclamation marks and display the spoiler text when clicked.\n\n# Some guidelines about spoilers:\n\n**DO NOT include spoilers in the post titles**\n\nMake sure that your post title does not have spoilery plot points. For example, posts with titles such as \"Love Show - everyone died!\" or \"Love Show - our main couple finally kissed in episode 20!\" will be instantly removed, regardless of how many comments are under it.\n\n\n\n**DO include the name of the show in the title of the post**\n\nThat said, please don't post overly vague titles. Please ensure that your post title contains the show's name at least. Imagine someone taking a chance to read the post only to be spoiled for a show they didn't want to be spoiled for.\n\nTitles such as \"A review\" or \"The ending of the show\" does not tell you what show is being talked about. Even if they are marked spoilers, they will be removed.\n\n\n\n**Add spoiler tags to spoilery comments**\n\nIf you're discussing a Show's plot point in a post unrelated to the Show, please tag your spoilers with spoiler tags, especially if you're dropping the comment on a post that has nothing to do with the Show. \n\nAlthough I'm generally more lenient with comments with non-spoiler-tagged comments in posts marked as \"spoilers\", comments without spoiler tags under a post that has nothing to do with the show will be removed. \n\n**Posts such as Episode Discussions, discussions about a show's ending must be marked as spoiler or it will be removed.**\n\nWhat it said.\n\n\n\nThat's it! \n\nHappy discussing!",

    "title": "Ming Yi- Love in the Clouds ( ! SPOLIERS ! ahead)",
    "content": "&gt;!We are almost halfway through the drama and Ji Bozai still doesn't know Ming Yi's identity.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Before in Episode 13, Ming Yi's companion beast 27 was revealed to be Ming Xian's. Ji Bozai fooled the others that Ming Yi was just Ming Yi but he became doubtful of Ming Yi's identity. But when everyone thought Ming Yi would confess everything and possibly seek help from Ji Bozai, she didn't.!&lt;\n\nNow, I've been seeing many people getting angry at Ming Yi for concealing the truth even till now. But I think her actions are justified. Why? Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, this isn't just about Ming Yi. Warriors from other realms are forbidden to go to other realms. JI Bozai might accept a liar Ming Yi, but would he accept Ming Xian? Ming Xian is after all his rival whom he doesn't know anything about.\n\nSecondly, Ming Xian is a male, Ming Yi is clearly a female. How? No one except Ming Yi's mom knew her gender, not even her Imperial father. So, if Ji Bozai somehow doesn't trust MY and decides to expose her, her mom would be implicated. Ming Yi probably loves her mom the most in this world. There was a throwback in episode 13, where MY was like \"Mom is right\" even when it feels unfair. No matter what her mother does, in Ming Yi's eyes, she is always right. So MY doesn't want to implicate her mother in all these.\n\nThirdly, Ming Yi grew up surrounded by lies. From the moment she was born, she was a \"male\". And in Ming Yi's eyes, love is measured by \"usefulness\". If you are useful, ten you are worthy of love. If you aren't, then you should be discarded- that's the mentality MY grew up with. She doesn't understand love, doesn't know how to love, and doesn't know how to make everything right. In short words, Ming Yi has low EQ -,- .\n\nLastly and more importantly, MY single-handedly won Qingyun Tournament for 7 years consecutively. Countless people admire and worship her. Now, she became a dancing girl in some place. Ming Yi is naturally proud, but along with her powers, her pride was gone too. Concealing Ming Yi's identity is just to preserve that bit of a pride in Ming Xian's name. Ji Bozai is Ming Xian's rival, and as he said, JBZ respects Ming Xian and thinks that he is a worthy opponent. But now? Ming Xian amounts to nothing. It's a big blow to MY. People don't really realize how hard it is to fall from the top into the very bottom. MY still can't accept her pathetic state, where she has to manipulate everything like a coward to save herself.\n\nAnother reason is hope. If Ming Yi one day regains her power, she doesn't want anybody to know about what happened to her.\n\nIn todays livestream, Neo Hou Ming Hao said, \"First, Mingxian used to be the God of War — a proud person. How could she possibly admit to her archenemy that she was the one who was defeated?  \n  \nSecond, in Wugui hai, there were many plants and flowers acting as surveillance. If she carelessly mentioned it, what if someone overheard?  \n  \nThird, she herself found it hard to accept the fact that she was poisoned and defeated.  \n  \nFourth, she didn’t dare to fully trust whether Ji Bozai completely believed in her — even though Ji Bozai truly trusted her.  \n  \nTherefore, Mingyi couldn’t take the huge risk of putting her life in someone else’s hands. That’s why she never revealed she was Mingxian.  \n  \nThe character herself doesn’t have a “god’s-eye view” — only we, the audience, do. So we need to understand the reasoning and choices she made from her perspective at that moment.\"\n\nThat's it for now. What do you guys think? Are her actions justified? Or is she just stupid?",

    "content": "Fun Fact: Hot Pot 火锅, has been around for centuries.  Earliest was possibly around the Zhou Dynasty but it was during the Three Kingdom's period that it took off.  There's a debate on where it actually started, from what I've read some people say Sichuan because that's what fisherman would do to cook their food quick, others say Mongols because they used their metal helmets as pots...which imagine cooking your food in a thing you wear all day lol then cleaning it out and wearing it again? Not sure how I feel about that...but they said it's during the Three Kingdoms Period we see basically what we know as hot pot because it was a large copper bowl cooked over a small charcoal stove. Apparently the Emperors and Empresses of the Qing Dynasty were particularly known to love Hot Pot...\n\nSmall fun fact 2: Smartweed is also known as Water Pepper\n\nRandom Food Pic: Personally I love hot pot, growing up though I called it 打邊爐 which is just the Cantonese way to say it.  It's easy to do at home, I have it for lunch a decent amount of times, also pretty healthy, broth, meat, veggies, what's not to like?   But it's fun to go out to the restaurants and have it too, we've been getting a lot more hot pot places in my city...I tried a new spot in my town over the weekend.  Here's the triple pot we tried. What's your favorite hot pot base?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0smwfko1jvf1.jpg?width=2953&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e9c3500310ec97836da8ebdf3e4a25659599676\n\n[Discussion Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nvqbn4/comment/njh0882/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) (Links you to past and future ones if you're reading this later)  \n[Masterpost and Discussions 1-4](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o23nk6/yummy_yummy_yummy_%E5%AE%B4%E9%81%87%E6%B0%B8%E5%AE%89_2025_what_are_your_first/)   \n[Episodes 5-6](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o3d780/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_56_discussion_post/)   \n[Episodes 7-8](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o4nv0u/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_78_discussion_post/)    \n[Episodes 9-10](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o5kodr/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_910_discussion_post/)    \n[Episodes 11-12 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o6fw46/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_1112_discussion_post/)  \n[Episodes 13-14 ](http://reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o6yuad/yummy_yummy_yummy_episodes_1314_discussions/)   \n[Episodes 15-16](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o7myiz/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_15_16_discussions/) \n\nSpoiler Warning: There will be spoilers up until episode 18, if you are on the SVIP and have already watched 19, please tag it under a spoiler tag!\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\n1. So how do you think this will work out for our couple...so my theory, is the loophole to them being together is they \"thought\" he was their ancestor and maybe all this time they were mistaken? Also didn't she see someone exactly like him in the modern time and was chasing after him anyway in episode 1? So maybe somehow they all end back up in the modern time? I really am curious how this goes...\n2. How long do you think Jicai is going to be in denial? Will we actually get real couple time?? I hate when it's only the last like 5 minutes of a show.\n\nEpisode 17\n\nSeems like Prince Zhao actually does have a small soft spot for Lin Yan, when his son suggested getting rid of Lin Yan, he hesitated and said not yet. Definitely a case of the son being super jealous of Lin Yan, doesn't excuse his cruelty\n\nI'm always in awe when people are like \"this is totally edible\"...or the first people to be like, \"let's eat this plant and hope for the best.\"\n\nMy favorite is just that they all start mentioning spicy dishes...Mapo Tofu really is one of my favs so good on them lol\n\nI'm not sure the logic behind \"If even her dad tricks her, she won't be tricked in the future\" seems like therapy bill in the future to me...\n\nlol Discus throwing and Papa Shen saying, how much it hurts\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whaduyb00jvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6b23055e362d13afbae1e1e34fcfc2796901cb5\n\nAlright, Papa Shen is redeemed for trying to save his wife and also covering her from harm...\n\nIs Lin Yan really that good that all like 10 of those guys are like...yep we won't mess with him, time to run away\n\nYou have to appreciate her priorities lol she is hanging from a cliff and her thoughts are, I haven't eaten everything and the diner hasn't fed everyone and accomplished what I wanted yet. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/stxpv2xc0jvf1.gif\n\nI'm getting flashbacks of Love Like the Galaxy, first because of the pagoda scene and also because the first thing she asks after the arrow is \"does it hurt\" 🥺\n\nWhat an emotional roller coaster...when she realizes he has an important case to overturn and he can save himself if it were just him...\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fv5n2kzl0jvf1.gif\n\nThen to see her family and seeing hope she will live and be saved. Seriously what a crazy emotional whiplash \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zafbeuxm0jvf1.gif\n\nNot to mention, I could feel his fear of losing her, he didn't care about himself, he was fighting so hard to make sure he could save her.

Comparing actors' popularity like it's some kind of race to the top.  \n\n2. Treating melon (rumours) like facts, so let's avoid accusing actors of this or that based on unverified melons.\n\n3. Being mean, rude and nasty during discussions. \n\n4. Calling the actors or other celebrities mean names or talk about them in a derogatory way.

And Elder Zhou is the leader of this rebellion. To be honest, I wonder why Elder Lei would think anyone would be happy being confined to a place. Human beings by nature love to travel, to be free — just the idea of not being free, even in a beautiful place, is a terrible thing.\n\nI guess in the end he was crying because he was losing the community he built, but again, you can’t restrain human nature.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77yde2a0khvf1.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06d0132c15bd3361c02c3d79cd429f55b16b905d\n\nOkay, I am bugged by this, but I wonder where Suige got the fancy clothes. 😆\n\nSeriously, I still do not understand why some of the elders want to kill Suige??\n\nBut just like the amnesia thing, this was resolved quite quickly with just a quick speech by our heroes. To be honest, I find it a little bit anticlimactic, even though I like the art in general. I feel that it’s necessary, like I said in my previous post — it’s a way to understand that power is needed to save the nation and to do the things that he must do.\n\nSo Dr. Feng got some magic mushrooms, lmao. What a pair! I hope they get married. 😆\n\nThat was a really bizzare scene though lmao.\n\n**Jiyang and Xiyang**  \nOh, princess, I admire that you are such a schemer right now, but at the same time, I can’t help but think that while a lot of people ship this CP, Jingyang is just not a healthy character mentally for her to be with.\n\nLet’s say that she ends up being the empress, and a lifetime with this emperor — who could lash out in anger, who has control over his emotions like a toddler, who only has eyes for women, wine, and whatever else, who probably has a history brutalising people. So no, despite how good the actor is, I don't think Xiyang is going to have a happy life.\n\nPersonally, I think they are very fun and \"entertaining\" (for us) together, but for her sake, I hope she has a much healthier future where she doesn’t have to fear for her life or her children’s lives or do evil deeds just to survive.\n\nBut the emperor definitely finds her exciting because she’s so unpredictable compared to all the damsels he has met. Still, as fun as this relationship is and as entertaining as it is to watch, truly, I just want a better future for our princess — that’s all.\n\nBut Xiyang still has the emperor wrapped around her finger and she manages to actually overthrow the Empress Dowager. \\*Slow claps\\*\n\n**Crazy politics still happening**  \nLook at the Dowager Empress, so comfortable in her newfound power. Don’t get too attached — it’s going to be over soon. Geez, she’s already introducing potential wives to the Second Prince.\n\n[WTF](https://preview.redd.it/4kve97oojhvf1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d52286315aa1e3a5dfb21c881d25a24f3420e3c6)\n\nShe totally reveals her intentions when she tells him she will make the decisions now — so she wants to be the real power. Second Prince, don’t give in!\n\nThe Murongs have bigger ambitions now — to be emperor! Damn it, I really didn’t see the evil in you, Uncle Murong. 🥴\n\nMeanwhile, Murong Yao is having nightmares about Suige’s brutal stabbing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wdxy2df6ihvf1.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57fc1179a01d59877686e64ab0587781b7c1376b\n\nGood.\n\nI don’t care if you have PTSD — in fact, I hope you have PTSD for the rest of your miserable life, and I think your miserable life is going to be a very short one.\n\nIt’s kind of amusing to see the Empress and the Murongs turn against each other so quickly. Such parasites — and man, who knew there was such evil inside Uncle Murong?\n\nAnd what right does the Empress have to order around Chenyang like that? Presumptuous. And that talk about doing everything for him? Yeah, we can see right through you!\n\n**Suige is MAD x5 now**  \nI seriously ugly cried inside when they showed the faces of the fallen — and especially seeing Lu Ke crying. We hardly ever see him cry. Murong Yao needs to pay for making our loveable teddy bear cry!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/28wkwyzcihvf1.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2b87f8ced6f170bd48b9b2ed10ba9a4e97cd6c6\n\nI have to say, the actor is such a good actor — he can do comedy and angst well. One thing’s for sure: Suige is mad.\n\nMaybe there was a 5% chance that Suige would've forgiven them even after he was stabbed. But when he lost his memory and Yixiao ended up stabbed indirectly because of that, that chance dropped to 0%. Now? -50%, which meant that our Murongs are gonna die screaming.\n\nP.S. Suige calls them brothers here. These are not just vassals but fellow brothers in arms.\n\n**The reunion of the brothers**  \nTruly, in all of C-drama, this is such a unique prince-brotherly relationship. I am so glad that our Second Prince came through for us and is smarter than he looks — he never bought his mother’s story.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cm5hirj0jhvf1.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26497b2da52f78838731231e955f63fd27e428fb\n\nThat hug is so heartwarming, and you know what, I like the weaselly minister that enabled their reunion. Despite being threatened by Murong Yao, our minister finally gained the courage to stick to what he needed to do. Maybe he’s just terrified of the emperor!\n\nAnyway, it must have caused Suige a lot to promise not to kill the Empress, which shows you how much he loves his 弟弟. When Chenyan asked why he never told him about the evil deeds of his grandfather, he said - what's the point? It'll only drive a wedge between us. Indeed, it takes a very special character to not hate the child of the family who caused his mum's death but love him instead. (Thinks back to the Alliance and how they decided to kill him just because he was the emperor's son.) In the end, she has the Second Prince to thank for that.\n\nMeanwhile Jingshi is plotting. Something. I don't know man, I can't tell with this expression.\n\n[Go Away](https://preview.redd.it/ecdm2a3qihvf1.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35c5e711092f7e856e50f8323d6b4fd72c68dce6)\n\nPS: Apparently \"Jingshan\" means \"still rock\" in Chinese. I THOUGHT IT WAS SO APT. (I haven't had the time to check the characters to be 100% sure, but it tracks lmao.)\n\nWhat do you think of these episodes? Are you as annoyed with Jingshan as I am? Did the Alliance arc end well for you?",

    "content": "I am currently on episode 13 of Love of Nirvana! Took me forever to finally watch this drama but discovering how good Ren Jia Lun is at his job along with people’s strong recommendations finally got me moving. \n\nQuickly, I do want to throw back to Under the Power. Made posts about this previously so won’t keep you guys reading about that one for too long. But him being in roles that require him to have more of a villain vibe (at least at the start) or perhaps it would be better to say a crafty, cunning aura is ✨incredible✨ and O say we need more! \n\nLove of Nirvana has been a good watch so far. I enjoy that it’s more focused on the tension between the two male leads at the beginning and all about the court politics with a side of girl ends up in awkward and dangerous situation. Romances being a slower burn in these types of plots are a hit for me personally. \n\nLi Landi is fantastic here too! The only drama of hers I’ve watched is The Coroner’s Diary and boy I was a fan of that couple 🥹❤️ I like the 大大咧咧 / direct and casual personality she has in this show lmao \n\nBut RJL is now for sure guaranteed absolutely no questions asked in my list of actors I will keep my drama eyes out for. Joining people like Bai Lu, Tang Song Yun, Xiao, Zhang Ling He, Tian Xi Wei, Yang Zi. I think his entire demeanor feels laidback and the characters that he plays in these dramas are such good fits. As an actor, he just really grew on me over time. ",

He is promptly discovered by Sun Liao, again.\n\nBut never fear, he’s got backup!  Our favorite dragon companion shows up just in time to save the kitty’s behind. And the two animal companions share a moment of camaraderie at a local eatery.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kngla7piybvf1.jpg?width=2418&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97480d527170381976ca0f64f94f170026d598b8\n\nEven though the list of Lord Hanfeng’s cohorts remain ever elusive, our heroes are able to glean from 27’s trip that Mu Qibai has been feeding innocent people’s primordial souls to a soul-eating tree. These souls will remain “alive” on the tree until they can be fed to the netherbeasts. And that is how a netherbeast army will be raised.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3h3zyw7uybvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=548b0544a04f50f0b9ed3f04bbc18a588b8c5065\n\nMing Yi wants to notify the powers-that-be from the six reams of Hanfeng’s plans. Bozai disagrees because his experience in the Sunken Abyss has made him skeptical of those in positions of power. Oh, do we get to add rich-girl-falls-for-guy-from-wrong-side-of-the-track to our romantic trope bingo card?\n\n# The ties that bind us\n\nAfter Hanfeng goes on a trip to meet the big wig calling the shots, Bozai visits his lair. Bozai discovers that Hanfeng has recaptured all the prisoners that were released from the Sunken Abyss and fed their primordial souls to the soul-eating trip. Among those poor souls is Ruoshui, whom he thought had safely gotten away.\n\n[All she wanted was to live. ](https://preview.redd.it/zm2p9gcxybvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9255cd2d3d8f85ecf0ce45fdd65ef84fb2e74544)\n\nIn the meantime, Ming Yi has successfully drugged Nanny Xun and entered Bozai’s spirit well. Lo and behold. Is that the Golden Millet Dream on the altar? It must be since Bozai had taken the pains to put a blood seal on it.  He clearly still doesn’t trust her.  But the next moment she is overcome by the guilt and grief Bozai feels over the death of Ruoshui and the other innocent victims. And she finally realizes what it means to share a marriage bond with someone.\n\n[Having Ruoshui’s gift show up in Bozai’s spirit well was a nice touch. ](https://preview.redd.it/rhqspl87zbvf1.jpg?width=2429&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d89db353ba8b1dfda26afedff024e592eb968d1)\n\nSo she rushes to comfort her hubby. Does that mean she didn’t find the Golden Millet Dream? And if the bond goes both ways, why can’t he feel it when she was suffering from Heavenly Grief’s backlash?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhxas87bzbvf1.jpg?width=2453&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0d31e7b235c7cf57dd0a164719454804a50a0cf\n\n# The Zhushui Spiritual State\n\nWe are finally introduced a third realm, the Zhushui Spiritual State. The realm is run by a ruthless tyrant. And just as some of you astute viewers have speculated, the said tyrant happens to be our cute \\*didi (\\*弟弟/little brother) Situ Ling’s dad. Situ Ling’s real name is Chao Yuan.\n\nWe also find out that Zhushui’s prince, Chao Yu, is the power behind Lord Hanfeng. It’s nice to see our lord weasel kowtowing to someone else for a change.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztcv566ezbvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=776f861a4fa59d33de72583f852ac8fd44f043e1\n\nWhat is not so nice is seeing how much abuse Situ Ling/Chao Yuan suffered at the hands of his older brother. It really puts into context why Situ Ling wants to become a warrior; and makes the fact that he is willing to give the Golden Millet Dream up for Ming Yi even more admirable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n7aw63n1cvf1.jpg?width=2411&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02f3c60dfe59e5ded95fec094e673dc6cc47a040\n\nAnd now that Fuyue has figured out where the Golden Millet Dream is, I hope she doesn’t end up causing trouble for our almost-reconciled lovebirds. Because surely that’s where Ming Yi and Bozai are headed?\n\n# Refining the Netherbeast\n\nIn an effective moment of self-introspection, Ming Yi seems to have made up her mind about prioritizing their battle against Hanfeng and the netherbeasts over her own well being. And of course her faithful animal companion be there to support whatever decision she makes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bnm5x4fn2cvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab389ad7ae9eb19402dcbfcbcc10699ff23304c3\n\nTo get rid of the netherbeasts, Bozai absorbs the primordial spirits of the netherbeasts into his own core in order to purity them.  Ming Yi offered to become the vessel but Bozai doesn’t think she is strong enough. I think he would just rather that he takes the risk than putting Ming Yi in danger.\n\nIt was fun seeing Lord Hanfeng failing in front of his overlord. He didn’t know what hit him.\n\n[I just can’t resist posting a good blood-spitting picture. ](https://preview.redd.it/mptqnj914cvf1.jpg?width=2446&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd7cc4e581c75d7610eb263375563aac8a915618)\n\nBozai’s efforts to strengthen his core in order to absorb the netherbeasts also earned him this sweet moment with Ming Yi.  He’s not only drinking stuff she prepared, he’s drinking directly out of her hands.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/meuhkcbj4cvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85b2c872a7bba108b7e76dd51be313728b35aee0\n\n# Other notable developments/observations\n\n📝Even as Ming Yi, Bozai, and Er Shi Qi are figuring out the secret of the soul-eating tree, Sun Liao is busy convincing Lord Hanfeng that his secret is safe. This is one hard scene to watch as we see both Sun Liao and Yan Xiao kowtow to Hanfeng and beg for his mercy. He even makes Sun Liao knock out his own tooth to fertilize his precious hanging bamboo tree.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9ru6v5o4cvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9808e14205d6afadebd0255c5be1265c2953ea53\n\nOh, who cares about Sun Liao.  My heart aches whenever I see Yan Xiao being subservient, which is freakin’…all…the…time. If I have a nickel for every time I see him do this, to either Hanfeng or the princess…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vf52cseq4cvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e015ba1518e52a00ce42c36d17e04ca6b03b0630\n\n…I’d have lots of nickels.  Speaking of which, his reaction when Sun Liao mentions the soul-eating tree tells me maybe he is a double agent after all.\n\n[“Hum…a soul-eating tree? That’s a nice tidbit of information…”](https://preview.redd.it/rc6z4rwv4cvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd977f3b07a8715a86a9d41ac30d90ad13c26875)\n\n📝In these episodes, all of our favorite sidekicks continue to shine. Here is Buxiu unwittingly poking a knife at Bozai’s wound.\n\n[“Er Shi Qi is so obedient to Ming Yi, Ming Yi must really have a close bond with Ming Xian…”](https://preview.redd.it/7ngwu4ox4cvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e998a642618396e190ad1a4a41bcbffbfa174c2)\n\nIn addition to the kitten and the dragon, our Nanny Moth had her moment in the sun when she commiserated with Ming Yi on the plight of the oppressed women.\n\n[“Is Ming Xian as despicable as the old man who wants to beat me every day?  Did he make you go work at Moonlit Blossom to replenish the family coffers?”](https://preview.redd.it/7x0rphl35cvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57ec5dd50f0bac3a9dfe6b620748ff4f399395f9)\n\nThere’s an interesting tidbit here, about how Bozai saved her. From her old man perhaps?\n\nI also like that she seems to harbor no serious ill will towards Ming Yi. If Bozai is still keeping her around, then Ming Yi must be worthy of some trust.\n\n# Finally,\n\nWe see Mu Qibai tell Meng Yanqiu a sob story about how he misses the bond he had with his niece. I am not sure how he hopes to make use of our resident airhead.  But I am sure I am not going to like it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kcl9d1it5cvf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=800bd7f67385af8612c5058f9a5aad1486509e89\n\nAnd just like that, we are almost at the mid-way point of what has been a fun, if sometimes flawed, ride. While the drama started out a little campy, I thought the last few episodes did a good job of balancing the comedy with the drama.  What did you all think?  Sound off in the comments below.",

    "content": "Here is a summary of major drama announcements, drama posters, trailers released for iQIYI's September 25 iJoy conference.\n\n📣 For announcements, two dramas came with main cast and creative team reveals, while the rest offered only partial information – such as a director or source material.\n\n📸 The platform also released individual posters for many of their upcoming dramas. I’ve compiled them all into this post. A few dramas had more than one poster so I combined them to fit within Reddit's 20-image limit.\n\n📽️ Nearly 40 trailers were shared during iQIYI’s conference day. At the bottom of this post, you’ll find a summary list of all drama titles and links to the trailers that day. Additional posters are in the comments of the trailer threads.\n\n📊 For those who enjoy stats and figures, I’ve included view counts taken earlier today for each trailer. One 🔥 = 10K views (rounded up); just a fun little heat index for our sub. 😅😂 Please keep in mind these were posted over half a day on September 25 so time zones (and probably Reddit's algorithm) may have some influence on the numbers. \n\nIt's been a few weeks since the trailers and posters dropped so the view counts have mostly stabilized – perfect timing to share the stats. The list is sorted from highest to lowest total views.\n\nThese figures provide a general snapshot of engagement in the sub across iQIYI's upcoming dramas presented on September 25. This data is intended for informational purposes only.\n\n***\n\n#Drama Announcements\n\nTwo dramas were officially announced along with their cast:\n\n📣 1 - [Ball Lightning 球状闪电](https://mydramalist.com/680929-ball-lightning)\n\n* 🎬 Directors: [Dai Mo](https://mydramalist.com/people/14287-dai-mo) (Detective Chinatown 1900, Endless Journey, Sheep without a Shepherd 2, Detective Chinatown)\n* ✍️ Original creator: [Liu Ci Xin](https://mydramalist.com/people/50181-liu-ci-xin) (Three-Body, The Wandering Earth 1 and 2, Crazy Alien)\n* ✒️ Screenwriter: [Chen Si Cheng](https://mydramalist.com/people/4814-chen-si-cheng) (Detective Chinatown 1 and 2, Lost in the Stars, Great Expectations - Twin Dragons)\n* 📖 Novel: [Ball Lightning 球状闪电](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%90%83%E7%8A%B6%E9%97%AA%E7%94%B5_(%E5%B0%8F%E8%AF%B4)) \n* Official filming start: April 25, 2022\n* Distribution license obtained: June 2025\n\n\n**Cast:**\n\nLeading actors:\n* Tong Yao\n* Wang Anyu\n* Yang Lixin\n\nSpecial guest actors:\n* Zhou Yiwei\n* Ding Yongdai\n\nSpecial appearances:\n* Yang Jue\n* Feng Wenjuan\n\n***\n\n📣 2 - [Abyss 深渊游戏](https://mydramalist.com/768859-abyss) \n\n* 🎬 Director: [Liu Haibo](https://mydramalist.com/people/34371-liu-hai-bo) (Trident Season 2, Brocade Odyssey, Thirteen Years of Dust, The Glorious Era, In the Name of the Law, The Rise of Phoenixes)\n* ✍️ Original creator: [Shen Lan 深蓝](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B7%B1%E8%93%9D/63855897) (Endless Journey)\n* ✒️ Screenwriter: [Nie Chengshuai](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%81%82%E6%88%90%E5%B8%85/59761961) (The Examination for Everyone, The Heart of Genius, The Devil between Us), [Guo Kaixu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%83%AD%E5%87%AF%E6%97%AD/66790833), [Xiao Shiyao](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%82%96%E8%AF%97%E7%91%B6/58374704) (Get Married or Not, Medical Examiner Dr. Qin), [Luo Dingyi](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%BD%97%E9%BC%8E%E5%B1%B9/66790835)\n* 📖 Novel: [Shen Yuan 深渊 (Abyss)](https://m.douban.com/book/subject/36641699/)\n* Filming production started: early October 2025\n* Official booting ceremony: TBA \n* Filming time period: 70 days\n* Filming location: Ningbo, Zhejiang Province\n\n**Cast:**\n\nLeading actor:\n* Allen Ren Jialun\n\nLeading actor:\n* Qin Junjie\n\nSpecial starring:\n* Wang Yanhui\n* Tian Xiaojie\n\nSpecial guest actor:\n* He Bing\n\nSpecial appearances:\n* Ni Hongjie\n* Hao Ping\n* Zong Juntao\n* Zhang Yichi\n\n***\n\nThe following dramas have the director, screenwriter, original creator and/or original works announced that day, i.e. no official cast (images 3 to 5):\n\n📣 3 - [Take a Nap 海岛舒服日志](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B5%B7%E5%B2%9B%E8%88%92%E6%9C%8D%E6%97%A5%E5%BF%97/66248702)\n* 🎬 Director: [Liu Chang](https://mydramalist.com/people/65911-liu-chang) (director: Our Ordinary Days, Go into Your Heart;

    "content": "Fun Fact 1: Skewers have been around for a long time...makes sense, it's meat on a stick after all but it dates all the way back to the Han Dynasty, with a stone carving of a kebab, which means this dates back to 25-220 AD. \n\nFun Fact 2: I mean we know the drama isn't accurate but just FYI, pork was never really considered unclean in Ancient China, that seems to be more of a western belief.  In fact, pork was considered expensive and for the nobles.  Common people were not able to really afford meat like pork.  Owning a pig was a sign of wealth.  There's a fun artifact from the Qing Dynasty called Meat Shaped Stone...which is basically a carving to look like Dongpo Rou 东坡肉 a pork belly dish.  There is a lot of pork in Chinese cooking...\n\nRandom Food Pic: So...the show calls it Agate Meat, meaning stone meat but it's most likely either Dongpo Rou 东坡肉 or Hong Shao Rou 红烧肉...in my case, I tend to make Hong Shao Rou 红烧肉 mine are clearly not as good looking...and yes, I'm one of those who take pics of my food LOL\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1684ffm8cvf1.jpg?width=2999&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3750892c6efbb380b57599e8090bfe93b18c16d9\n\n[All Discussions:](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nvqbn4/comment/njh0882/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Masterpost and Discussions 1-4](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o23nk6/yummy_yummy_yummy_%E5%AE%B4%E9%81%87%E6%B0%B8%E5%AE%89_2025_what_are_your_first/)   \n[Episodes 5-6](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o3d780/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_56_discussion_post/)   \n[Episodes 7-8](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o4nv0u/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_78_discussion_post/)   \n[Episodes 9-10](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o5kodr/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_910_discussion_post/)   \n[Episodes 11-12 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o6fw46/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_1112_discussion_post/)   \n[Episodes 13-14 ](http://reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o6yuad/yummy_yummy_yummy_episodes_1314_discussions/)\n\nSpoiler Alert: Remember, spoilers up to episode 16, if it's beyond episode 16 please put it under a spoiler tag\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\n1. How is the Shen family going to stay safe now?  Is Prince Zhao going to just give up?\n\n2. Has anyone thought of a theory on how our couple stay together even when they go back to modern time?  \n\nCommentary\n\nEpisode 15\n\nHe looks so sad!!! :( \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wjm7eykv1cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c94c538da13c7071b8fe6266c2effe26af1bc10\n\nLOL of course he confesses and she's asleep \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/srtajtuw1cvf1.gif\n\nI'm sure the Prince totally noticed a girl in his carriage...or maybe not...? \n\nOh man, the almost kiss \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/rw13qvn12cvf1.gif\n\nHe is telling the truth, i was thinking he would have tried to make something up but best lies are laced in truth right? \n\nSo the Prince is trying to use AnRan into influencing the Crown Prince...to what gain more power? \n\nThe Shen Men still annoy me...but I am curious if the Prince really is having fun or not\n\nThe slightly flirty Lin Yan is my favorite...\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ojsma4152cvf1.gif\n\nThe hand pat 😍\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ylfqyc8q2cvf1.gif\n\nSeriously, the ego on Papa Shen is hard to watch \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7sbgjwv2cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=820f6ed6ba083f77feaab509718d92ba4856ac7a\n\nOof I wonder how we're going to deal with the background check. \n\nThe actor who plays the Prince does a good job being a bit creepy/evil.  Is he in anything where he's a good guy? \n\nlol I love the attention Deyuan is getting for that time period \n\nBut the poor attention Jicai is getting \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qy2ka8py2cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e708cd1d2ba527fb7ad32a8371d622de556c95e\n\nThe hand grab to drag her away 😍\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vj125doz2cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af1474280ec1edd769945c277b3d1a65f149121\n\nlol 12th versus 47th is a big difference but also holy moly 47th \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qvxysdr63cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d30f55727811ff6ba472f809bac7f87b6a1067a\n\naw \"can't you just stay\" has me swooning \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0wykpz483cvf1.gif\n\nJust going to leave this here...\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/yps0qoz83cvf1.gif\n\nIt's definitely suspect that the Prince wants them to just completely relocate. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yibkamhb3cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3d1487adcc5e0788e47909c752f8ecf67e92404\n\nI'm glad Jicai finds it suspicious \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fw8fdhha3cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e823d7ce1335060450091029da1869445c6d0a4b\n\nEpisode 16\n\nNotice how Papa Shen hasn't actually apologized, he's just saying, let me come back. \n\nlol I love that Liu Chang asks why are you sneaking into her bedroom so late \n\nWhy do I feel like the Chengzhou thing is a distraction from Prince Zhao so that Prince Zhao can take the family as hostage? \n\nI'm glad Jicai thinks logically at least...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqx839zc3cvf1.jpg?width=2880&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc5e0afc65e79bb9d2374e5ba08fa853298f1fbd\n\nHowever...the brother and father, dumb as a box of rocks.  I swear. \n\nI was right, the Prince did distract Lin Yan \n\nOmg the brother and father are so stupid.  Seriously, they make my blood boil \n\nYEP knew it\n\n...if you become useless...guess what...they probably just kill you, so not a good idea Gongcai...\n\nThis prince guy does seem crazy, makes sense given his dad.  However, for holding a child hostage and threatening her, I need something bad to happen to him later in the show. \n\nLOL at least there's some comedy there with the ex-wife thing.  I like that they all agree \n\nSo at least they can't be killed, starving isn't great either though \n\nLin Yan giving off Blossom vibes \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k298mwwf3cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aab338329e005a6a89077b80a6e08165e48070aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9vmdnjg3cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fa327e6e26582de49fdc48b500d81fa72ab8814\n\nLove that they escaped lol \n\nHe's so proud \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s99n25ah3cvf1.jpg?width=864&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0a6ed2cf882a697ec1bfbf52d98e0647cb22a7\n\nWell I'm excited to see how the next episodes turn out.  I do splurge for SVIP so I'm going to catch Episode 17 later today but for now, I need to finish working a bit.",

Poor girl.](https://preview.redd.it/p7nk7q4y9avf1.jpg?width=860&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce76275f130a0d62a5b960de0016e6cf6c3936ef)\n\nAlso, I am for sure he actually cares about her.\n\n[He's smitten alright. ](https://preview.redd.it/cvg63s9t9avf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8534419bcab98db3edbc87ea1c4e54a985b2f5e8)\n\n **At the Alliance**\n\nLu Ke being the **biggest** FSG–YX shipper is adorable. News from Susha finally arrives and…\n\n[His acting is really good here imo](https://i.redd.it/7ymutlu5aavf1.gif)\n\nWas it wise for YX to pop into the room right then? Shouldn’t she have waited till the people FSG trusted explained more?\n\nThat arrow — such a curse and a blessing. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0agt3b5gaavf1.gif\n\n💭 *What would you do? Leave the person you love so they can heal… or stay, even if it hurts, or be the end of you?*\n\n🌳 **The Tree**\n\nAuntie An is a romantic at heart. Old Huang gives YX hope with that marking on the tree —  \n正 = five days. \n\n***Just a note,*** *the 正 is like how we do the IIII and a cross to indicate 5x.* \n\nTo YX, this was a sign that deep in Old Huang's memories, there’s still traces of his wife. Which means, deep in FSG’s memories there are possibilities of traces of the good times him and her had together.\n\n**Back in Jinxiu**\n\nThe Emperor and his flower picking again. I see… this man likes the thorny ones.\n\n[I know there's something that's not right with him but I can't help being attracted to this hot mess.](https://preview.redd.it/irfu14lddavf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f28351a767cf2f92a6e0c7e8d97fdc483a95ac4)\n\nAnd wow — he talked back to his mother. She does *not* look pleased. 👏👏 for the effort.\n\n **At the Alliance again**\n\nYX remembers his plea not to abandon him — and her promise. So it’s settled then, our girl is staying!\n\n Then she tries to jog his memory: river/lakeside moment, spicy meat, and… is that a clay dinosaur?! 🤣\n\n[Lu Ke taking it for the team 🤣](https://preview.redd.it/22spt4cjdavf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b28beaaf8961d4b9b0ec8b3e6cc8b6432e7aa9c5)\n\nAnd who didn't laugh during this howling moment?\n\n[FSG: WTF?! 🤣](https://i.redd.it/5ayfppdwhavf1.gif)\n\n **In Jinxiu**\n\nThe Empress Dowager is scheming for war against Susha. Ministers divided. XJS still in her pocket. \n\nWhat is her end goal here with her son and XJS, I am still unclear. And I still can’t get a read on XJS’s expression. It’s always the same.\n\n[More less, always this face!](https://preview.redd.it/cv0f3pblcavf1.jpg?width=860&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51aeaf663979f2d249eba470a9e5e23e335bbd1b)\n\nThe Princess + Emperor pairing — whether real feelings or not — is 🔥🔥! She’s got brains; he’s got power. And at the moment, both got nothing to lose and going all the way.\n\nBasically: *everyone in Jinxiu is scheming and most are insane!*\n\n**Meanwhile in Susha**\n\nOur (弟弟/dìdi/little brother) Emperor wants the truth about Daddy Emperor’s death. I am happy he’s still a good kid and showing that he can stand on his own two feet.\n\n**Ending of Ep 31**\n\nFSG vs YX face-off. Sword drawn. Full circle to the arrow from episode 1.\n\n[Exactly what he said, what are you doing, YX?!](https://preview.redd.it/ecs107rldavf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=915be521cc701945a6751d6bed436559d7e154c2)\n\n  \nWas stabbing herself *really* necessary?!\n\n# Episode 32\n\nMaybe it was necessary, maybe that shock was what he needed because slowly, his memory returns.\n\nShortest amnesia trope ***ever*** in c-drama history!\n\n[😭 I’m crying with them 😭](https://i.redd.it/mz85wuhrdavf1.gif)\n\n#  Our couple is back!!\n\nI must say, both actors did an amazing job during the emotional scenes. The emotions seemed genuine and I was in tears.\n\n**Back to Jinxiu**\n\nPrincess is scheming hard, she knows who the mole is and sets her trap.\n\nEunuch Bai: *caught.* Strike one!\n\nAnd who did it? \n\n[Take that, XJS!](https://i.redd.it/t83u8pn0eavf1.gif)\n\nThe Emperor gave her the credit. 👏👏\n\nThen these two... \n\n[As heartless as XJS can be, at least he has good self-awareness.](https://preview.redd.it/m2m3cc65eavf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc27c6abcb57533da5a43146ff4e27f0daf42edc)\n\nI’m so conflicted about this Jinxiu Emperor. He’s insane but also oddly endearing — like a toddler who found his favourite toy.\n\n[The actor did a fabulous job with this character!](https://preview.redd.it/c00yfkjneavf1.jpg?width=2688&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=160f160a8adaaf2d8f359645bfd9231d9ce3a7fb)\n\n**Back at the Alliance**\n\nYX plans to leave in a few days and Auntie An looks worried. Like Fight Club, the Storm Alliance has rules. What’s Storm Alliance rule #1? No one leaves the compound!\n\nI do love the royal siblings’ closeness here — rare in dramas where they usually backstab each other à la Jinxiu.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/bpl9komseavf1.gif\n\n **The Alliance rule strikes Lu Ke**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b9nx5kvveavf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fbde1ddc974fac557dff9d4eb5e827b14325352\n\nElder Lei ponders FSG’s claim that it might not have been Daddy Emperor who ordered the Susha massacre.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k5spvlczeavf1.jpg?width=2740&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=229e3b7635ce95077ff692231920798c342acf7b\n\nI love that FSG himself is helping Lu Ke apply the medicine even though Ning Fei, for example, could have done it.\n\n **Didi Emperor**\n\nHe isn’t buying the “FSG killed Daddy Emperor” story. Through hints from that one silly Minister, he’s piecing it together. Poor kid, he’s going to be heartbroken.\n\n[Ding, ding, ding! Yup, you go it!](https://preview.redd.it/lop9wdrzfavf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=715eb761c7f45cd57bad1a937cc17a06e4b03053)\n\n**Alliance elders are divided**\n\nElder Zhou and the lady elder (blanking on her name) are plotting to kill Elder Lei. Zhou wants power; she just wants every Feng dead.\n\n**Ending Scene**\n\n[She's so pretty, and a view of her past innocence.](https://preview.redd.it/tsddy65hfavf1.jpg?width=2688&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc438e5326ea805081c9b82a8abf2f12258e57fa)\n\nPrincess walks through memory lane — her dowry triggers thoughts of her father and brothers. And she gets to see her maid again!\n\n**Preview for Ep 33–34**\n\nLooking forward to this: The Princess vs XJS heating up 🔥 \n\n**Question…**\n\nWhat do you think XJS truly wants — full power, both Emperor and Empress Dowager out, or happy to be leading to troops as long as the Emperor is dead?",

    "title": "Hilarious Family 2: Ep 01 to 16 and an appreciation of its comedy",
    "content": "Firstly, I have not tagged this with the spoiler flair, since  these gifs were mostly created because of their lines or reactions, with most of the humour relying on the context within the drama. Therefore i dont consider them spoilers. But ill immediately add it if someone points out the need for it🫡\n\nNow, I haven't watched Hilarious Family 1, so i had no expectations starting Hilarious Family 2, besides what i was told by by soul sister who was enjoying HF2. She described the drama as a cast of unserious people interacting with each other, and i think that is a perfect description.\n\nThe comedy has made me laugh my stomach sore several times. Its not the absurd sort, nor iis it deadpan comedy, and it reminds me of sitcoms more than anything. I find the characters very likeable, despite their flaws and I enjoy their interactions even more. Another aspect that contributes to its overall experience is the excellent use of sound!\n\nSome of my favourite scenes include the rescue of the great-grandaunt, the 'rivalry' between Ruan Ling and Guiwei, the rotten apples, and the fiasco over the fake letter. And for comedic duos, its Mrs Luo and her maid, Cuiyang, No 132 and 347, and of course, Ruan Ling and Jing Kan What were yours? (Preferably from this batch of episodes😅)",

    "title": "Some thoughts on When Destiny Brings the Demon Ep 19",
    "content": "Disclaimer: This post will contain spoilers up to this episode. Please do not post spoilers for future episodes in the comments please.\n\nI started When Destiny Brings the Demon a few weeks ago and have just finished episode 19 and thought I would share my thoughts since this is the first big climax/turning point that we've seen so far. Up to this point, I have mostly enjoyed this show, though I also come with a couple of concerns and issues which I would like to talk about.\n\nThe episode starts off with Sima Jiao entering Taiwei Mountain and meeting Sima Shi, also known as his father, who has been nurturing the Spirit Fire. The explanation was a bit confusing for me...they needed Sima Jiao to absorb the Spirit Fire to break the ascension curse (which renders the Fengshan Clan to be weaker?). In order to grow it, many clan members were sacrificed in the process..which is some pretty dark stuff. However, I just found that Sima Shi's delivery was a bit too nonchalant. And then he just \"dies\". I think the interaction between Sima Jiao and his father could've been executed better since he this is the first time seeing one of his family members, let alone his father, by adding more emotion to it. But maybe that was the point.\n\nAfter Sima Jiao absorbs the second spirit fire and then fights with Shi Qianlv, Shi Qianlv reminds him that Tingyan would also perish. Sima Jiao immediately leaves to find Tingyan (understandably) but also doesn't strike the final blow to Shi Qianlv, which would've probably prevented a bunch of future problems down the line. I just feel like that is bad writing.\n\nWe then see Tingyan get killed by the Spirit Fire and then we find out 1) there's an 18 year time skip and 2) she lost her memory when she's in the demon realm. The time skip is not \\*that\\* bad considering Sima Jiao was asleep during that time but it definitely felt jarring on first watch. I felt like they could've devoted a few more minutes just showing how the incident at Taiwei Mountain affected everything. It all happened so fast and I felt like I could've used some breathing room. Amnesia is a common trope in Cdramas and while I think that when executed well, it could be useful but I found out &gt;!through a comment that Tingyan doesn't get her memory back until ep 26...which is a very long time and will definitely test my patience...!&lt;\n\nLittle character rant:\n\n* They butchered Nianjiu after he turned into a human. First, he was naive in Ruling's schemes and got captured as a result -- and couldn't even fight back. Then he couldn't protect Tingyan when Ruling had come to capture her in this episode. This is the same character that protected Sima Jiao when he was sealed for 500 years? He is a liability both literally and figuratively. I can understand being naive when first turning human but at this point, he is only causing problems or not doing much at all. His character does have potential but at this point his character mostly serves as a plot device. I miss the CGI snake.\n\nAnyways, I know this post sounded kinda critical but I am excited (and mildly cautious) for the demon realm arc which is a nice change of setting from everything we've seen so far and should hopefully give us more insight into Tingyan's character. Would appreciate some thoughts.",

    "content": "I'm very grateful to have stumbled onto Watch Your Back. For those of you who travel, you know that pickpockets are a problem all over the world especially in big cities and for me, this is my first time ever to watch a crime drama specifically focused on pickpockets. The ML detective is sort of like a Colombo, but only cuz he dresses down. He’s like a friendly uncle, affable and very understated but so, so smart in how he spots and interacts with pickpockets.\n\nI’m only on ep 1, and just felt I had to write this cuz it had me laughing out loud and truly grateful to find something so different to watch. I don't think there's gonna be any romance but if you like eye candy, the new recruit should be “hosting a tv show,” per the ML, instead of being a cop going after pickpockets. And the FL who usually plays the typical pretty and smart… fill in ur choice of business woman, broadcaster, designer, etc., here, plays a TCM doctor, a woman who conducts herself very simply (not necessarily bland, just sort of a zen-like simple), speaks very little, if at all, in a low pitch, who has OCD tendencies and lives in her own world in a kind of standoffish way — not arrogant, just a very much, stay-in-her-own-lane, her own world, kind of eccentric gal.\n\nIt's just a refreshing different kind of show; I hope it stays interesting.\n",

There is a bit of folklore behind mooncakes during the Yuan Dynasty.

It’s gonna be a bumpy ride (I hope!).\n\n[Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o11y5s/love_in_the_clouds_%E5%85%A5%E9%9D%92%E4%BA%91_2025_what_are_your_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) | [Episodes 1 - 5 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o2r9tt/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_1_5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)| [Episodes 6 - 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o3ijm7/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_6_7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) | [Episodes 8 - 9 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o43xua/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_8_9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)| [Episodes 10 - 11](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o5ajyo/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_10/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) |\n\n# The calm before the storm\n\nEpisode 12 is full of cute and funny scenes.   it’s as if the writers want to fill us up with the warm and fuzzies before ripping our hearts out of our chests.\n\n❤️Women of the world, unite!\n\nZhang Tai has decided to leave Moonlit Blossom.  It’s a good thing that she actually has business acumen and can sell hairpins for  a living. While hawking her wares with Ming Yi, Tianji shows up.  After some slight, initial awkwardness, the women softens toward each other, with Tianji buying out all of Zhang Tai’s hairpins and Ming Yi putting a hairpin in Tianji’s hair.  In a world that is not kind to women, it’s nice to see these women forget their differences and bond over a mutual love of hair accessories.\n\n[Tianji may be frustrating at times, but she’s not a bad sort.  She just needs a friend. ](https://preview.redd.it/lxqdse2wx4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9218d5c6fade717644bed96bf904d8582b1a98c3)\n\nAnd how sweet it is of Zhang Tai and Ming Yi to go weep Xinliu’s tomb even though they have never met. Their good deeds are rewarded when Ming Yi comes across a scroll that Xinliu left, detailing Lord Hanfeng’s various crimes.  The scroll mostly lists things we already know - like Hanfeng raising a netherbeast and confining innocent people in the Sunken Abyss to refine Heavenly Grief - but the fact that these atrocities are done with the involvement of people from the upper three realms is interesting. Ming Yi promptly hands the scroll over to Bozai, but not before removing the bits about the people of the three realms being involved.  It’s yet another lie built upon the web of lies she already wove.  I understand why she did.  But it just adds the potential for more misunderstanding in the future.…&lt;sigh&gt;…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qugly4w1y4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98120eb2e7dc9ff61670bb23f94e7f0cc2d44443\n\n❤️The way to a woman’s heart…\n\nIs to take her shopping.  Ming Yi thinks Bozai’s feeling guilty because he’s using their marriage for his own purpose, but I think he just wants to make her happy after being encouraged by Nanny Xun to let Ming Yi share his life (bless that woman…)\n\n[It never occurs to Bozai to help her carry her purchases…](https://preview.redd.it/ykz7rm26y4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=339ab30372b3177c1f17f96c67d0dac814cd2011)\n\nMing Yi being Ming Yi, she’s not above using his goodwill to coax him into producing some useful magical artifacts for her. His indulgent smiles tells me he knows what she’s doing, but he lets her get away with it. In one of the beginning sequences Ming Xian lamented that no one knows her. I think Bozai does even if he doesn’t know her real identity. I just hope he remembers this when shit hits the fan.\n\n[Scallion pancake shield?  Is it edible? ](https://preview.redd.it/3o2peyyqz4vf1.jpg?width=1622&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0dcfe372fb57a756be87c26205cb9f1b799cfcb)\n\nHe then says that if she’s willing, their wedding can become reality.  He looks at her expectantly.  She looks like she has no idea what he’s talking about. So he flees the scene of the crime by making an excuse about having some important to attend to.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am1gnfyoz4vf1.jpg?width=1628&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfbe1bb8dc786ab71cba4d54bf1bb46fec3447ca\n\n❤️Master and disciple\n\nI found Ming Yi’s interaction with She Tianlin numerous and heartwarming. Did she really have no idea what he’s talking knows her real gender? They reason that if people from the upper three realms are in cahoots with Lord Hanfeng, then the person who poisoned Ming Xian may very well be someone from Yaoguan Mountain. So off he goes back to investigate. But not before worrying that Ming Xian may really be falling for Bozai. Here is one person who really seems to care about Ming Xian, even if her own father is starting to doubt her loyalty.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l71ub81jz4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2179e312d1a9f03f1d00eecd10ea83f908c15144\n\n# We are in the same boat now…\n\nAnd that brings us all to the moment we’ve been waiting for. Ming Xian’s secret is revealed when 27 braves the Sunken Abyss to look for the list of people in cahoots with Lord Hanfeng and gets captured. Hen then runs back to Wugui Sea and inadvertently leads Lord Hanfeng and his minions back to Ming Yi.\n\nOh, Er Shie Qi.  We love you but that was a stupid thing to do.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjdhqafgz4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ffc0440801247e5f7993e3a02bd997b9ba38742\n\nUpon hearing the news, various interested parties descend upon Wugui Sea to defend Ming Yi and Bozai, who is now being accused of consorting with the enemy.\n\nJi Bozai: The search mirror can easily be controlled.  Yes. I admit it. I am a traitor. Because Ming Xian begged me to let him lose. So he can pretend to be a woman and marry me. (Hum…it does sound ridiculous the way he puts it.)\n\nSitu Ling: The search mirror belongs to Yaoguan Mountain. So how did Lord Hanfeng get his hands on it? If Bozai is working with Yaoguan Mountain, why is Lord Hanfeng the one with an artifact from Yaoguan?\n\nTianji: Ming Yi can’t be Ming Xian. Why don’t we let them do the heart imprint on the Marriage Stone?\n\nUm…for a a second, I actually can’t tell if Tianji meant to be helpful. Or if she’s trying to catch Ming Yi in her lie. I think it’s the former though.\n\nBozai also pets Ming Yi’s hand in reassurance, which gives me hope. He surely knows who he is by now, but he understands and forgives her, right?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tge2lfdz4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4af98dce87210e8899bc15c7e1fe4a67646b7635\n\nNot so fast.  Because Bozai then says that he’s paying her back for what he owes. Stop giving mixed signals Bozai!\n\nAlso, all of these people seem to still think that Ming Xian is a man disguised as a woman, not the other way around. Wait until they find out that they’ve all been fooled by a mere woman…\n\nSo off to the Marriage Stone they go.\n\n❤️Obstacle #1: The love bridge will only connect for real lovers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3xfe1b9z4vf1.jpg?width=1617&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3be714a6a8e72a7d0d2f6deff5f95a2c97febaa7\n\nI think my question got answered by the fact that they are able to penetrate the Mengyuan Pond, because only true lovers can cross it. Mengyuan 盟鴛 means “Promised Couple”.  All the others who arrive after Ming Yi and Bozai, including an unhappy Situ Ling, are kept outside of the barrier.\n\n[“How can it be?” ](https://preview.redd.it/fi6jufq3z4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c2ec79b0936a6f31d23d8bb108f60fdd27e0d2c)\n\n❤️Obstacle #2: Carving their names on the Marriage Stone\n\nThis one turns out to be a doozy. Because if their love is fake, they will undergo divine punishment. The lighter punishment will see their primordial spirits damaged. The harsher punishment will have their souls scattered to the four winds.\n\nDespite the risk, Bozai proceeds with carving their names (his real names and Ming Yi’s fake one) on the stone anyway. Because what choice does he have? They are in the same boat now and Ming Yi can finally get what she wants.  This is the first inkling we have about how tightly Bozai is controlling his emotions right now.  For the first time since he got out of the Sunken Abyss, he trusts someone.  But she turns out to be only playing him for a fool.\n\nAs Bozai tries to carve Ming Yi’s name on the stone, he gets struck by lightning again and again. As he falls, a bottle of radiant spirit falls and breaks. So he did listen to Granny Yun and make a wish to the stars and harvest the radiant spirits in the hopes of having a real marriage with Ming Yi.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8qzzj0d1z4vf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e07d9e9fe04497aadc4489e052164f8d9e242951\n\nFinally, the Marriage Stone got tired of him and decides to let him carve Ming Yi’s fake name. Huh?  Or is this a case of his true love softening the marriage stone’s stone-cold heart?  Either way, a red thread now appears to bound them together.  They are well and truly wed now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7kktof4zy4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14c0975c5b7a9d3b28295c07ba875da076b0b295\n\nHum…But what this also means is that Ming Yi’s original plan of getting Bozai to carve their names on the Marriage Stone was SHITE.\n\nBut at least we can put all the lies behind us and star ane…\n\nHold my beer.  Says the writers.\n\n# I can’t tell him the truth just yet…\n\nBozai’s primordial spirit is obviously damaged from his bout against the marriage stone. So Ming Yi tries to heal his wounds and revealed that she has spiritual veins.\n\n“Who are you really?” Ji Bozai asks.\n\nWait…what?  I thought that was obvious?  I guess not.   Because that’s when Ming Yi starts spouting off more lies about her being Ming Xian’s fiancée and how she’s here to find out who in Yaoguan Mountain is working with Hanfeng and how close she is to Ming Xian which is why she can command his animal companion and…excuse me while I go find a huge rock I can use to hit her on her huge, stupid, useless, and constipated noggin.\n\nSeriously, this woman has the EQ of a gnat. Can’t she see that she’s only twisting the knife, and that now is not the time to appeal to his reasons but his emotions?  Granted, she’s probably going to end up in the slammer either way but talking about how he needs to keep her around to help him get to the bottom of Hanfeng’s perfidy is NOT the way to go.\n\nBut maybe it’s because she knows that he’s fallen for her, and doesn’t want to further exploit him?  Either way, I feel like channeling Tony Leung during the last scene of In the Mood for Love.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/io360riey4vf1.jpg?width=1513&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d54e39f0f20ca84c5b024bf45d190cc7f2c546c1\n\nAnd Ji Bozai is not buying it anyway.  He knows she’s still lying to him. And he’ll keep her locked up until she is ready to tell him the truth.\n\n# A Truce, of sorts.\n\nExcept Princess Tianji wants to see them, so Bozai had to let Ming Yi out to keep up appearances.  The two then reaches a detente, of sorts, after Ming Yi pledges to help Bozai refine the netherbeast by using her own body as the refining vessel.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/20m2zqn9y4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c2a69638451139a37e5fe631ce680022c66671c\n\nBozai doesn’t take her up on the offer, but does agree to work with her. On three conditions.\n\n1. Ming Yi cannot contact anyone from another realm. (Hum..methinks what he really wants is to prevent her from contacting Min Xian.  He is jealous of her alter ego.)\n2. Ming Yi has to come running whenever he summons her.\n3. She just need to tell him how to refine netherbeasts.  She doesn’t have to worry about anything else.\n\nSo the two are now working together but not completely trusting each other and not quite a couple. Honestly.  I feel like I’ve seen this script before.\n\n# 調虎離山 (Luring tiger away from the mountain)\n\nIt’s time to train for the next Qingyun tournament.  To keep an eye on Bozai, Hanfeng’s laptop Sun Liao suggests that the five warriors all move into Wuguai Sea. As a compromise, Tianji suggests that they all move into Shuohua Academy.\n\nUnlike the others, Bozai’s married status means that he gets to bring Ming Yi and have his own room. This allows the two to stage a fake fight.\n\n[\\\\\"A leak cannot be repaired.  Broken is broken. We can't go back to before.\\\\\" Um...this fake fight sounds all too real to me.  ](https://preview.redd.it/t5u49igep4vf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=956d9a2d6d6cc732a2940d713d776768bcf833d9)\n\nBozai pretends to be kicked out, goes to the Moonlit Blossom, proceeds to get roaring drunk, and asks Lord Hanfeng to visit him.  I am assuming this is lure Hanfeng away so Ming Yi can pay a visit to the Dragon Carp Terrace. Regardless if this ploy works, I really enjoyed watching Hou Ming Hao ham it up as the drunk, aggrieved husband.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkivuqz6q4vf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb4864e013573f71605be17b2c2b48c16f327942\n\n# Checking in on our other long suffering characters\n\nIn the entire realm of Jixing Abyss, there is not one happy camper to be found.\n\n❤️Tianji and Yan Xiao continue to do their song and dance, except this time it looks like Tianji is seriously considering cutting her losses. Yan Xiao‘s latest act of betrayal - leading guards to arrest Bozai in the one place that Tianji still has some control over - really cut her to the quick.\n\n[As usual, Quan Yi Lun’s micro-expressions stole the show for me. ](https://preview.redd.it/nnier54tr4vf1.jpg?width=2457&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5af7a04ce8692ae24966f796e1b46da02e778e)\n\nI really need to find out what Yan Xiao’s game plan is. Is he really an opportunist looking to advance, or is he trying to protect Tianji like some of you have speculated?\n\n❤️Situ Ling has one dream - to grow some spiritual veins and become a warrior like Ming Xian.  But when push comes to shove, he is willing to give up his dreams to save Ming Xian. Unlike Tianji and Yan Xiao, whose fates are no means certain but at least it’s not completely hopeless, I think it’s safe to say that Situ Ling has no chance against the misfortune of having been cast as cannon fodder.  It’s not your fault Ling Ling.  You are just not the ML.\n\n[“Their wedding must be fake.  There can’t be anything real between them”.  I am sorry Ling Ling.  But you are bound to be disappointed. ](https://preview.redd.it/02svaaf5u4vf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51320537fc782248cb2eb9e541b871e9557b5c99)\n\n# So,\n\nTrust the writers to give us a grand revelation and then walk it back. Are we back to square one?  Not exactly.  Have we made any progress then on the central relationship?  Yes and no.  Oh..whatever.  I am really not sure what I am saying anymore.  So I am just going to let those of you who are smarter than me figure it out.  Sound off in the comments below!",

    "title": "TOP 10 Chinese Dramas for the week (October 6-12)",
    "content": "It is a busy week and big budget costume dramas releasing every week but what is worth your time? For viewers who often wonder, ***“What should I watch besides my favorite actor’s latest drama?”*** \\- this ranking guide offers a good starting point. It highlights the most-watched Chinese dramas of the week while also introducing lesser-known yet high-quality series that are gaining strong reception in China but may still be under the radar for global audiences. Within the top 10, you’ll find not only shows featuring big-name stars but also hidden gems with relatively unknown casts that are attracting attention through compelling storytelling and solid production.\n\nKeep in mind that a single week’s ranking doesn’t necessarily reflect a drama’s overall quality- it simply shows what most audiences are watching at the moment. However, if a series continues to remain in the top 10 for several weeks, it may be a strong indication of consistent quality and widespread appeal.\n\n**TOP 10 DRAMAS** (*Dramas that are airing on both TV/WEB are excluded from the Web List*)\n\n**Bold**\\- New Entry / **Bold +** ***Italics***\\- New No. 1\n\n|Rank|WEB (platforms)               |TELEVISION (CCTV+Satellite)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|***Fated Hearts (Li Qin, Chen Zhe Yuan)- costume (1st week)***|***Love's Ambition (Zhao Lusi, William Chan)- modern (2nd week)***|\n|2|Hilarious Family Season 2 (Li Jiaqi, he Saifei)- costume|Silent Honor (Yu Hewei, Wu Yue)- republican|\n|3|The Journey of Legend (Cheng Yi, Guli Nazha)-costume|Growing Together S2 (Zhang Jiayi, Chen Hao)- modern comedy|\n|4|Time Raiders (Francis Ng, Xu Zhenxuan)- modern|Hunting (Wang Yang, Zhang Youhao)- modern|\n|5|Justice is Mine (Nick Cheung, Myolie Wu)- modern|The Guardians (Zhang Yishen, Elvis Han)- republican|\n|6|**Love in the clouds (Neo Hou, Lu Yuxiao)-costume**|Wild Ambition Bloom (Rayzha, Tony Yang)- republican|\n|7|Mobius (Bai Jingting, Janice Man)- modern|This Thriving Land (Yang Mi, Ou Hao)- republican|\n|8|Twelve Letters (Zhou Yiran, Wang Yinglu)- modern|The Long Way Back (Hun Jun, Li Naiwen)- republican|\n|9|**Yummy Yummy Yummy (Wang Yinglu, Li Yunrui)- costume**|Zhen Di (Feng Shaofeng, Li Chen)- republican|\n|10|**The Hunt (Huang Xuan, Teresa Li, Bai yu Fan)- modern**|Our Home land (Wang Lei, Yuqi Chen)- Republican |\n\nIf the drama sustains its presence in the ranking for more than 3 months, they will be moved to ''THE ETERNAL LIST'' table. The Eternal List table is the ranking of top 10 dramas so far releasing in 2025. The list below is a work in progress and not final.\n\n|RANK|THE ETERNAL LIST 2025|FINAL SCORE/100|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|This Thriving Land|77.79208|\n|2|The Legend of Zang Hai|63.87958|\n|3|In the Name of Justice|59.17396|\n|4|Northward|55.35938|\n|5|Flourished Peony|52.02208|\n|6|The Journey of the Legend|51.22865|\n|7|Love's Ambition|39.875|\n|8|The Prisoner of Beauty|37.64063|\n|9|Drifting Away|36.33333|\n|10|The Immortal Ascension|34.23167|\n\n**How the score works for the Eternal List**\n\n1. TV peak rating (cap 5%) → 25 pts. Reflects national broadcast strength (CCTV + satellite). Top-tier dramas (≥ 4-5 %) dominate primetime ratings. This is like Nielsen rating.\n2. Kuyun TV market share (cap 5%) → 15 pts. Measures real-time audience share across channels; complements traditional TV ratings with live tracking.\n3. Yunhe market share (cap 50%) → 20 pts. Captures streaming ecosystem dominance across iQIYI, Tencent, Youku, etc.\n4. Average play per episode → +15 pts. Rewards consistency of viewer number.\n5. Popularity heat ≥10,000 → +10 pts. Balances Tencent’s 0-30000 vs Youku/iQIYI’s 0-10000 scales. Measures online buzz &amp; virality.\n6. Total cumulative views → +10 pts. Rewards total views. This changes over time and is a dynamic parameter, affecting the ranking.\n7. Sustained #1 across charts/time slot (&gt;7 days) → +5 pts. Rewards consistency and long-term audience retention.\n\n**This Week's Highlights**\n\n**What to watch?**\n\n**TV Drama**\n\n**Silent Honor (Yu Hewei, Wu Yue)**\\- Jumped to 2nd position this week from 6th last week. It is a bold, ambitious entry in the Chinese espionage / war drama field. It distinguishes itself by focusing on a less dramatized front (in/Taiwan covert operations), employing serious production values, and gathering strong performances. It works best when viewed with a bit of historical-literary awareness, understanding that it is both drama and ideological narrative. If you enjoy spy thrillers, layered plotting, moral tension, and historical ambient weight, this could be a rewarding watch. If you prefer more balanced or less politically inflected storytelling, you might need to read it through a “filter.”\n\n**WEB Drama**\n\n**Fated Hearts**\\- It is an entertaining, no boring-episode drama. It has turned out to be a compelling mix of romance, intrigue, and action. Unexpected but wonderful chemistry between the leads. I am watching it myself. It aims to deliver on both emotional connection and plot tension, which has made it standout among recent historical romance dramas. If you like: Enemies → romance arcs,  Strong female leads who are not just damsels,  Intrigue, conspiracies, hidden agendas,  Costume dramas with aesthetic ambition, … then Fated Hearts is worth giving a try.\n\n*Ranking Process*\\- This has been designed to be the ''Mother of all rankings''. I am using the average of data across Kuyun, Yunhe, Vlinkage, Douban charts, and Datawin, weightage at 20% each. The mean value is recalculated dynamically for each consultant, for each day, and for every drama, for a period of 7 days.\n\n*For further details, please check: Original post (details about ranking and other notes):* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top\\_10\\_cdramas\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_week\\_32/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top_10_cdramas_for_the_week_week_32/) \n\n*For Eternal list process, please check:* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o6ndlq/top\\_10\\_chinese\\_dramas\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_october\\_612/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o6ndlq/top_10_chinese_dramas_for_the_week_october_612/)",

    "content": "One of my favourite things to do is to analyse a CDrama's Chinese title. So, Fated Hearts is **一笑随歌** in Chinese. It's actually their names to gether \"yi xiao (one laugh/smile) and sui ge (with a song ~~smile~~). So, \"A Smile with the Song\", which implies harmony. The smile and the song are companions; they exist together. It paints a picture of someone smiling *while* singing or listening to music, capturing a moment of joy.\n\nI thought it was such a beautiful name for the drama (and rather clever too, combining their names into something that showcases how our couple are together.)\n\nAnyway, on with the show, and as usual spoilers for episodes 1-30, and please spoiler tag if you want to discuss plot points after episode 30.\n\n[Masterpost Ep 1-6](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nvvi7h/fated_hearts_%E4%B8%80%E7%AC%91%E9%9A%8F%E6%AD%8C_2025_what_are_your_first/) | [Ep 1-8 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nxjknn/fated_hearts_%E4%B8%80%E7%AC%91%E9%9A%8F%E6%AD%8C_2025_ep_18_discussion/) | [Ep 9-10 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nym2kn/fated_hearts_%E4%B8%80%E7%AC%91%E9%9A%8F%E6%AD%8C_2025_episodes_910_discussion/) | [Ep 11-12 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nz7esi/fated_hearts_%E4%B8%80%E7%AC%91%E9%9A%8F%E6%AD%8C_2025_ep_1112_discussion/) | [Ep 13-14 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o03fp1/fated_hearts_episodes_13_14_discussion/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)| [Ep 15-16 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o0u8nv/fated_hearts_episode_15_16_discussion/) | [Ep 17-18 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o1h5k2/fated_hearts_episodes_1718_discussion/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) | [Ep 19-20 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o2e5sd/fated_hearts_episodes_1920_discussion/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) | [Ep 21-22 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o30h59/fated_hearts_episodes_2122_discussion/) | [Ep 23-24 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o44buu/fated_hearts_episode_2324_discussion/) | [Ep 25-26 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o4oh9m/fated_hearts_episodes_25_and_26_discussion/) | [Ep 27-28 Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o5l3vp/fated_hearts_episodes_27_and_26_discussion/) |\n\n# We have a new CP and it's mad 😵‍💫\n\nThe emperor delivers the news of the Susha emperor and Suige's deaths in the most brutal way. Alas, I actually feel sorry as she crawled on the ground crying and begging to return home.\n\n[And the OST comes on reliably at that moment](https://preview.redd.it/10gvova9j2vf1.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=705dcee335db38405a42f872bb76e5d39dcdbfdb)\n\nAnd wow, pray tell, is the emperor's expression softening during this scene? He even looked ... kind.\n\nI get the weird impression that he's like a teenage boy taunting the girl he likes. :P\n\nTheir interaction in the next few episodes is basically this: insults/threats -&gt; slaps/violence then 👇\n\nXiyang: OMG he's so gross  \nJingyan: OMG she's so hot\n\n[Honestly, how is Jinxiu even functioning right now with this emperor](https://i.redd.it/vdqinnx8k2vf1.gif)\n\nXiyan wants the empeor to find out the truth about her brother and father's deaths.\n\n# Jingshi is plotting (yawn)\n\nHow is Jingshi reacting to all this? At one point he even offered to help Xiyang but I have a hard time interpreting his expressions, so I've NO idea if he meant it, is trying to do something shifty, but the *sad music* comes on, and so I suppose is sad. Is it Xiyan who is sad? Jingshi? Who knows man, because interpreting Jingshi's expressions is harder than cracking the Enigma code because he looks like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwid5osvk2vf1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1ad6bb1365c844916b86736fcbe2616d4ab1ad1\n\nNo hate against the actor but lord help me can you emote a little more?  I swear a block of wood has more movement than his facial muscles. And since the actress who plays Xiyang can act circles around him, his lack of acting skills is even more stark beside her.\n\nEach time he appears on screen I sigh and feel the urge to just fast forward. I know Jingshi is planning something nasty overthrowing emperor stuff, but I don't give af. I'll stay awake for his inevitable demise, however.\n\n# Storm Alliance\n\nIt may be called the Storm Alliance, but to me it's the Hippie Commune of ~~Bloodthirsty~~ Jianghu Sages but it's a mouthful so we'll stick with the Alliance.\n\nNing Fei is fine now but he isn't very happy in that village. Turns out he's having some real survivor's guilt.\n\nLove Ning Fei, loyal to the bone but not the brightest bulb in the universe because he immediately outs Feng Suige.\n\nSee, apparently the emperor tried to wipe out the Alliance, and one of the rules is that every Feng has to die for that. Never mind that he is Qingyu's son. (Hey, isn't that a tad unfair? What has the son gotta do with the emperor's sins? Doesn't his mother's DNA count at all? Geez.)\n\nLater, I find out why Elder Lei and the main chief of the Alliance was so mad, and understandably - their children died in the siege. But there's a big chance it was Prime Minister Zhuang who did it, so I hope this doesn't escalate. (lmao who am i kidding)\n\nI immediately love Elder Zhou because he seemed nice. (I will come to &gt;!regret this once I see the previews lmao!&lt;)\n\nWe find out how Qingyu, Suige's mum, came to found the Alliance.\n\nNow I can understand Qingyu's mindset. We find out more about how she founded the Alliance. After being badly injured, she got tired of war and decided to create the Alliance to help the victims of war, and Dr. Ling was there from the start. I can see how all the palace intrigue and pettiness felt pointless compared to what she was trying to achieve with the Alliance.\n\n# Xiyan pays the price\n\nThe emperor finally meets someone more crazy than he is. A match made in Bonkersville. May the couple be blessed with many sane children.\n\nActually, jokes aside, I don't know if I'm supposed to ship them but there's one thing certain, being intimate wit the emperor disgusts Xiyan:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5n7qroian2vf1.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47e060faa87ab0d6f2a3abdb7867e31878032300\n\nYet the kiss was uhm, hot.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mjar8zown2vf1.gif\n\nStop it show, you're confusing me. I'm not sure if I should feel yuck about this CP or ship it hard. \\*sweats\\*\n\nAlso\n\n**Why does our mad couple have more kissing time than our leads dmanit, i protest**\n\nThe morning after - we can see clearly that the whole act has broken her a little. I guess her romance novel marriage dreams are done and dusted.\n\nAnyway, I don't know whether to feel sorry that she has to use the age-old weapon of femininity: sex - to achieve what she wants or be proud of her for her ability to manipulate the toddler emperor.\n\nI guess I take back what I said about her being unambitious. She's incredibly ambitious, and can be cunning and determined to get what she wants, as she told the empress. To quote someone on xhs: \"Siuge takes after his mom, Xiyang takes after her dad\".\n\nYet, I feel a little sad that she had to resort to this, lose her innocence like this and had to learn her lesson in such a terrible way.\n\nSuige is going to be SO MAD. Speaking of which ...\n\n# Suige is on the edge of death\n\nWhile the Alliance dallies with deciding whether he should be treated, Suige is closer to death. But finally they get the okay to proceed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qiout57p2vf1.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=767ea464ae49c533ac1f695e97c0614c7bcdd0ca\n\nMe while watching this\\*: Taking notes of the scars on his torso for medical research\\*\n\nUnfortunately, while he manages to wake up, Suigehas gone blind, and he won't recover his sight. This shatters Yixiao. (My heart broke a little when she covered her mouth to hide her sobbing from Suige.)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/dbytwggdm2vf1.gif\n\nSuige tries to comfort her by saying it's all right, he'll adapt. Yixiao, unlike Suige, isn't happy to \"settle\" with his blindness and demands/beg they heal him.\n\n(But secretly, Suige is frustrated and hugely upset with his condition as he had all this revenge thing to do. Suige, see what you did - you shouldn't have said the vengeance was over in episode 28. You've jinxed it and now we're in this fix :P )\n\nLater, to make things worse, Elder Zhou later tells Yixiao that there's a blood clot in his brain that could kill him. (He really cannot catch a break can he, Suige?) But fortunately there's a cure. 👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7c8us1kum2vf1.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03fd39188dd49d78b886da055dfa5dee9daf9b3b\n\nWell, hello ~~Sa Dingding~~  Lady An (though she's called \"Auntie An\" in Chinese), a woman Dr. Ling fears more than life. (Theory: She's his ex.)\n\nHer name may mean \"peace\" but she brings anything but that!\n\n# The palace people are still scheming against each other\n\nOof, what a nasty world. Murong Sr is urging Murong Yao to strengthen his position. The empress is telling Chenyang to distance himself from the Murongs eventually now that he's emperor. None of the kids look happy about their new lives. I have ZERO sympathy for Murong Yao, but poor Chenyang, he is so out of his depth as emperor. He's going to be **eaten alive.** (But is he having doubts about the tale the empress is telling him about Suige's treachery?)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dsknk0bwp2vf1.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb78fab0956ace27c29ef8cbaa66564408c541c0\n\nLook at the parents, living their dreams and ambitions through their kids. Story as old as time.\n\n# The price of healing\n\nI wonder if Suige briefly wondered that he could just settle in the Alliance with Yi Xiao and forget the world outside? After all the world thinks that he is dead, and no one will miss him (sobs).\n\nHowever, Suige is too honourable a person for this. Although he broke off things with his dad, I do know he will be driven to avenge him, and he still cares for his siblings who are caught in this messed up web.\n\nAlso, just because he forgets them, doesn't mean that the Murongs will ever stop hunting for him. Him being blind is a huge liability not just to him but to Yi Xiao, whom he never wants to put in danger. So in the end, I felt that his logic to go forward with the procedure made sense.\n\nOn top of that, all the men had died for him!! Retreating into a quiet life is effectively turning his back on them.\n\nSo the procedure was inevitable. And I find it interesting that Yixiao is egging him on to take it (I think it's her way of trying to save his life, even though I'm sure she doesn't want to lose the person who fell in love with her. She decided to put his desires before hers, basically.)\n\nBut so heartbreaking that Suige said, if I turn into that ruthless Killer God of Susha again, please don't leave me in disappointment 🥲\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1o6f37g/video/1vptizshq2vf1/player\n\n(BRB Going off to cry into a pillow)\n\nI like that he didn't do the classic noble idiot move of pushing her away! Instead he expressed his anxiety about losing her love.\n\nAs she waits for Suige to reawaken, she stares at the former patient of Auntie An who continues to stare blankly at the sky.\n\n# Oh noes\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/m12to0k4r2vf1.gif\n\nWell, I guess it didn't go well. 🫠\n\nSuige promptly passes out after his fit. Poor guy. Boy did the Murongs do a number on him. Unfortunately their deaths are probably going to swift. Prolonging the timeline of their suffering doesn't seem like a bad idea now.\n\n[I have to admire how handsome he looks eventhough he passed out from the mother of migraines ;P](https://preview.redd.it/fmxqvo1ls2vf1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af00c3089a41898dfa9b82984a84bd9c0e26d56f)\n\nSo, our couple doesn't have matching T-shirts.\n\nThey have matching MISERIES.\n\n✅ Shoulder bites  \n✅ Arrow wound on the shoulder  \n✅ Betrayed by loved ones  \n✅ Led by f-ed up people\n\nAnd now\n\n✅ AMNESIA\n\nNever say they don't understand each other's problems 🤣. Hey it's the foundation of a solid marriage\n\nAnyhoo, when I first heard that amneisa was coming, I was like\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/f2brgeh1i2vf1.gif\n\nBut sometimes, really, I am partial to amnesias. I find them amusing. It entertains the stand up comedian that is my brain. Oh man does my 🧠 go full on with the quips when amnesia strikes. But amnesia executed poorly is EXCRUCIATING. And one way is to drag it out for 10000 years.\n\nIt's just that most of the time amnesia is done badly and they do it drag things out and add more drama.\n\nThat said, I want to say I saw some spoilers that &gt;!the amnesia will last just an episode and memory returns in episode 31!&lt;\n\nNow, was it even necessary? Well, remember when Suige said what a blessing it is to forget the past? That way you can forget all the terrible things. Honestly, after the hell he's been through, including being brutally stabbed by someone he considers his true father figure, it is in a way, a relief and will give him space to process things.\n\nAnd thus the episode ends ... while we wait another 24 hours for more episodes. (Melts into a puddle)\n\nThese episodes weren't as intense as the previous batch but still as angsty. Poor Suige. Fate has out it for him.\n\n# Previews of episodes 31-32\n\nDamn it &gt;!Elder Zhou! I thought you were a good guy! Is there one person who doesn't want to betray Suige? Also, I'm pretty sure by ep 32 Suige is back to his old self.!&lt;\n\n# Questions to ponder\n\n1. Did you think the amnesia arc was necessary?\n2. Are you for/against the emperor/Xiyang arc?\n3. What do you think Jingshi is up to or are you checking out like I am? :P\n4. Yixiao pressures Suige to undergo the memory-altering procedure to save his life. Was she right to do so, even if it risks changing the man she fell in love with?\n5. With the reveal of her backstory, has your understanding of Qingyu's character and her taking away her children from the palace changed?",

Did you all also jump around while watching episode 12 or is it just me cuzz swoooooon?! 🥹 I'm jumping right into the discussion because these two episodes were so fun to watch! Be warned of spoilers!\n\n**Episode 11**\n\nWe are introduced to Lu Yun, the owner of Yunlai Tavern, who checks the ledger of the restaurants and finds deficit and loss in their sales.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93x9ukvys3vf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f41402c3412dfb3b74d421b408201cf6745dfd24\n\nSo he threatens the employees to handle the Shens asap and this makes Manager Feng lose his mind.\n\nSuddenly people eating at Shen's diner start to vomit and fall sick, so people surround the Shen's to attack them, accusing them of posioning the people. The Shen's deny poisoning the food.\n\nThe officers from the Capital Prefecture arrives and tries to put away the mob, but a man, who has been instigating the people saying his brother was posioned and was dying, tries screaming and accusing that the Shen's can still do business despite poisoning is because they are relatives of the Vice Prefect and that Lin Yan is supporting them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27adhzx8t3vf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73eee4bebea8cedf3e6b95e6014bdf1cbd5e774a\n\nBut Lin Yan arrives and announces to temporarily suspend the activities of Shen's Diner and seal it until further notice.\n\nThe Shen's feel wronged and thinks it's an unfair treatment towards them. The father and son duo thinks Lin Yan is being mean to them. Jicai is also angry and disappointed that he sealed their shop without hearing any justification.\n\nTo get out of this deadlock, they come up with an idea. The Shen family pretends Gongcai has also been poisoned and is dying and Mother Shen also pretends to jump and claims had they intentionally poisoned the food, she wouldn't have fed her son with her own hands, and Father Shen walks around the Juxian streets asking for justice for being wronged.\n\nIn the meantime, Lin Yan visits Princess Fuhui and gathers that she knows something about the culprites behind his family's execution.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uojb9pn6t3vf1.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c432209b34f3cb8f13771acacbe847341dc74544\n\nLin Yan also sees through the Shen's plans and tells them that he knows Gongcai isn't really poisoned.\n\nThe Shen family confesses that they are angry because Lin Yan unjustly selaed their restaurant, but Lin Yan explains that he did that to buy them some time. He suspects that someone intentionally poisoned their food or made them use posionous ingredient.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rvtx6s5et3vf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28b2d79419214ca2186c09c2d680045367c05e43\n\nThey identify that their mushrooms were switched with posioned mushrooms, which caused the food poisoning. And they suspected it was done by Yunlai Tavern.\n\nAnd since Manager Feng and the stewerd believed in ghosts and spirits, they decide to scare him. So Jicai dresses up as a ghost and Deyuan does zombie makeup on her face while Lin Yan watches adoringly.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijfz4cjlt3vf1.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e045546a3a11b68bcf229183f5263a76013fbe24\n\nWhile climbing the roof, Jicai falls down and Lin Yan hurriedly jumps to catch her, and they beautifully fly down with Jicai held in a princess carry in Lin Yan's arms.\n\nJicai is very surprised (her heart should have fluttered, right?)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7zk5e6st3vf1.png?width=1095&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dab78994bdb605e74982558d8c5c9e520cd9a4d\n\nLin Yan even puts on fake blood on her face. Being quite flirtious, aren't weeeee???!?!!\n\nAnyways, they scare the stewerd, and even uses the noble ladies who are crazy fans of Gongcai to make him confess. He admits everything was done by Manager Feng.\n\nThe next day, the court judges the Shen's as innocent and punishes the stewerd and the manager, who fled in fear of punishment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e2wj64vt3vf1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b926290e5db3496fb1820b5f0a57a6f2a776c5ee\n\nThe Shen's invite him to dinner and even bows down in apology and thanks him with deep gratitude. Yangyang runs to him, calling him master, that she learned from dramas and asks Lin Yan to become her master and teach her lightness skills.\n\nSo, after dinner, Lin Yan takes Yangyang and Jicai to show them the trick, but Yangyang gets scared and run away. Jicai also asks how it feels to fly, so Lin Yan holds her by her waist and flies upwards.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18gp2rhyt3vf1.png?width=1095&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6a3863289f276a41ac934b45d4680d2ec99f5a7\n\nScared, Jicai holds onto him tightly in a hug, and they land of the roofs. Jicai praises the night scenary of Yong'an and they sit down to talk about various things, including their thoughts and feelings about their home and childhood.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cvh81uz0u3vf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b55f251985f297d673e5078d922aad8603e3bf3\n\nJicai complains that she was angry because she thought he was only thinking about his career, but Lin Yan is instantly defensive and confesses that it wasn't the reason and he was just being petty ( I can't believe he did that because he held onto the marriage cancellation against them 😆😆😆)\n\nThey decide to be friends and shake hands, and Lin Yan relents from her touch for awhile (that is sooooo romantic!!!)  \n\n\n**Episode 12**   \n  \nThe next day, Princess Fuhui invites Lin Yan for a visit, but he denies, saying he had official business, despite the mid autumn holidays going on.\n\nIt's said that this is the third time he has denied the Princess's invitation.\n\nMother Shen brings mooncakes for everyone and explains Jicai has added fortune telling notes with them. The one Lin Yan finds wishes him a pretty bride, which he carefully tucks inside his sleeves.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2nw5ej7u3vf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=335375686dc02a7598da7943910e1d90e10534b2\n\nEveryone gets excited about what type of wife he would prefer and Gongcai jokes Lin Yan prefered someone like him. But Lin Yan ignores them all and stays quiet.\n\nLin Yan has everyone leave early for the festival but he stays back claiming he has work. But he is actually sad and misses his parents. He even takes a stroll and watches a family of three packing up their shop and leaving for home to celebrate the mid-autumn festival, the daughter even asks for a sesame flavored mooncake.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gry2rj4bu3vf1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f6f80e1300fa66cef42e81b8bdf0d511eb59c2f\n\nAt the Manor, Liu Chang says that Lin Yan is busy so no need to send him dinner, which the Shen's pretend to listen, but then laughs at Liu Chang as he complains in a low voice that they were so nonchalant about it.\n\nBut the Shens laugh and then prepares dinner for all of them. They call Lin Yan for the dinner, toasts to him and even picks out food for his bowl.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80j84tveu3vf1.png?width=1085&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d37a231e80a253a0adf469f9b4a5d00dd78248e9\n\nLin Yan looks happy that he is not alone. However, the happy dinner becomes a mess when Father and Mother Shen breaks into a fight, to the point of screaming fir a divorce. They get angry at each other and leaves the table.\n\nEveryone gets flabbergasted and goes after them, however, Jicai sits alone later. She also asks for forgiveness to Lin Yan that he had to see something so embarrassing and shares that their parents have struggled a lot.\n\nBut Lin Yan tries to comfort her, saying everyone had shortcomings. They both share tidbits about their families. So Jicai suggests that Lin Yan should become her confession partner.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ktswkgshu3vf1.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35f47a387f0d0a83ddee2f43bc1a9935e19047dc\n\nShe sets up a screen between them and shares a lot of things on her mind, from the modern times to her insecurities. Lin Yan also shares his thoughts, about feeling guilty for not being able to do anything for his family and missing them. Seeing him cry, Jicai hugs him, which takes Lin Yan by surprise.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vk228tku3vf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae0964c9b7d6284eca5c09d2d698253c79cf9f0d\n\nHowever, just when he was also going to embrace her, she stands up. They smile at each other, both feeling differently (Lin Yan obviously still reeling from her hug).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4n6rqmnu3vf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75a46ce205db5e67a72b837d26fbeb55e1d577ed\n\nThey begin drinking, and talk about funny things. Jicai tells him that he feels like a friend, but she should maintain respect between them. But Lin Yan doesn't like the sound of it, and sits closer to her, asking if she still thought he should be revered.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bldw4g3ru3vf1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87e15e40a1b52e433feda6faf64abc1c28d0016e\n\nJicai, drunk, leans in and kisses him, which completely takes him off guard. He even stands by the window later at night, staring outside, lost in thought.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uqmtsevuu3vf1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1fd04e410ff57271bd3edaef2435b087bb51711\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bg2h3mwwu3vf1.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7279f1d4527fddbd1dffa6d6b570a3a78e540b3b\n\n  \nThe next morning, Jicai wakes up and remembers kissing the Vice Prefect. She runs to his room and falls on her knews, kowtowing and hitting her head on the ground in shame, asking for forgiveness.\n\nLin Yan, who was brushing his teeth is surprised and asks her why she begging for forgiveness. He claims he doesn't remember anything from last night (but he clearly wasn't drunk).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3f0qz70v3vf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11d565f18774c5fe9d675503b77bc562b1f74c3e\n\nJicai grabs onto the opportunity and just pretends to ask forgiveness for being too blunt the previous day, as he is the respected Vice Prefect and even imagines Lin Yan princess carrying her into her room after checking her fever.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmf4a248v3vf1.png?width=1093&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62a6539d6d1e7656903a30f6d77d1c9bbd347f9c\n\nTurns out, it's half true, but instead of the princess carry, Lin Yan carries her on his shoulder. He puts her down in front of her room (so courtous!) since he can't enter an unmarried girl's room, but Jicai remarks it was okay since they even slept together (I think in Chinese, the word she used meant something more, since he got visibly embarrassed) and Lin Yan warns her to choose her words correctly when talking and to be careful to not talk like that as a girl.\n\nJicai is confused. She thinks she deserves the fever since it's divine pubishment for her conduct. Later, the family fusses over her fever and parent Shens continue verbal jabs against each other, but Lin Yan arrives with medicine.\n\nParent Shens try to feed her the medicine, but she refuses to drink anything, and so Gongcai suggests secretly to father Shen that Lin Yan should try as Jicai wouldn't refuse him.\n\nSo they ask Lin Yan to feed her, and out of embarrassment, Jicai drinks it all in one go, surprising everyone. Telling her to rest, everyone leaves, but Lin Yan takes a moment to linger to gently whisper to take proper rest.\n\nLin Yan remains gentle and polite, in fact, a little too gentle, rousing questions inside Jicai's mind if Lin Yan really didn't remeber anything.\n\nI think Lin Yan is pretending to respect Jicai, but he clearly remembers the kiss. Also, anyone having negative feeling regarding the marriage cancellation contract?\n\nThe contract clearly mentions his previous name, if someone finds it, it's trouble troubleeee!\n\nEdit: Previous post links and images.

My heart is still pounding from everything that’s happened. Let’s get started!\n\n# Ep. 27\n\nThis episode starts with the PM Zhuang and Feng Sui Ge showdown. My thought watching this scene—especially this part—was: how hypocritical of you to ask not to hurt your family because it’s your feud and the Emperor’s, but it’s okay for you to frame the late Empress and go after FSG?\n\n[You have no place to ask for this when this is something you didn't do yourself.](https://preview.redd.it/ap93i0n9xvuf1.jpg?width=931&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e471d23415531253e927dd4ef3a732de8d4caab)\n\nAnd all of us watching:\n\n[Excuse me?!](https://i.redd.it/r1y8ixxlxvuf1.gif)\n\nUp until a few episodes ago, I thought the PM was the main villain, or at least one of them. But it seems like all he wanted was to avenge his son’t death and that’s it. The grandson being the Emperor would just be a bonus and security for his family’s existance. So PM is out and FSG got his mom’s name cleared out.\n\nFSG leaving the palace with **“BREAKING NEWS!”**\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/vh2rsybsxvuf1.gif\n\nAnd the receiving end…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/laqbd8mvxvuf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7e303d0959e93c28b21e999c8ffa129522aabec\n\nDaddy Emperor—or ex-Daddy Emperor—even after all that, is still hung up on losing to his wife. And his issuing the imperial edict to confiscate the Zhuang’s property, including demolishing the ancestral hall **BUT** leaving the Empress alive, seems like the Emperor’s way of asking for his life to end sooner rather than later.\n\nDid I feel bad about the Empress when she was cradling her dad and hearing about the edict? A tiny bit but it was mostly because I knew there was a genuine father-daughter bond.\n\nWhere is Yi Xiao? She’s been helping Doc Ling and giving him a little attention once all the patients were taken care of.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jlqvfl6yxvuf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac111469cbf9751e142a1c221066c92ab571114c\n\nBut, the second she saw FSG, all her focus switched to FSG.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9c8l0yqzxvuf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8477b082e623194f7f0280c8f58d4af5ebc1a0f6\n\nEven the Doc was disappointed—and to be fair, if I were on the receiving end of that massage, I’d be too.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/svgt4m01yvuf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efa93f660922a62685b42a5a3470e1d4e79026fd\n\nMarquis Murong… he just wants his son to be safe. I get FSG and MY did try to kill them multiple times but I still feel bad about the Marquis. Then the Marquis kneeling in front of the Emperor’s door.\n\nI don’t like joyous occasions in the middle of a cdrama.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwaf3d55yvuf1.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe42edd935fbeeca56807f8f052cf6cd5130821b\n\nBecause I feel like it’s just the way for the directors to get us read for the angst and tears that’s about to come.\n\n[Not shy at all!](https://preview.redd.it/pwckmhs6yvuf1.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d5aa053dd07b67158e49d419dbda1092c7d6459)\n\nAnd yes, if you’re holding hands in front of your subordinates, you may as well be Mrs. Feng 😂\n\nFor those who speaks Mandarin fluently, did Lu Ke called FSG “大哥“/dage or “big brother” and so he then called YX “大嫂“/dasao or “eldest brother’s wife”? I had this part on repeat many times because I was almost sure Lu Ke didn’t call FSG 先生 but the translation said Mrs. Feng for YX.\n\nEither way, so cute!\n\nI love how they all bonded at the party and they are all ”兄弟“/xiongdi “Brothers”.\n\nI must say this is stunning visual.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/pndz481cyvuf1.gif\n\nAaaaahhh, Marquis went to the dark side to protect his son. And why did he have to kill the Eunuch?! My heart is broken. Eunuch Ma such a good man!\n\nFSG being framed and then attacked by the Marquis. And the sword stab…\n\nEnding ep 27 with this.\n\n[Love our couple!](https://i.redd.it/jh5wutudyvuf1.gif)\n\n# Ep. 28\n\nMurong Yao. Literally a back stabber.\n\nHow tragic. The person who thought of you as uncle and best friend became the end of you. And the Marquis being more ruthless than Murong Yao.\n\nIf you’re a regular cdrama viewer, you know that falling off a cliff does not equal death. I wonder how this one, which seems to be really dead, come back to life. Since it’s the ML we know that somehow he’ll come back, right?\n\n[Face of regrets](https://i.redd.it/8obvg1qhyvuf1.gif)\n\nMarquis and Empress teaming up. I didn’t see this coming. Did any of you?\n\nRuyan was true to her words in following MY. In the meantime, can anybody psychoanalyse and explain the different faces of MY here.\n\n[Are they all sadness or they're the good and bad face coming and going?](https://i.redd.it/6g9l2wvlyvuf1.gif)\n\nYS, don’t use a stick that aggressively, I get you but what if you accidentally slash his face with it?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtkxjqipyvuf1.jpg?width=930&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f1dfbb9d953d85576c9e72d4e0fd4bed6c816a4\n\nOooooohhh, he wasn’t really dead yet. Just unconscious because his airway was blocked. Ancient time surgery and stitching happening by Doc Ling. Everybody's anxious. I was too!\n\nMurong Yao is really sad. But it seems like he’s more sad that he made it difficult for his dad and not that his friend is dead.\n\nThis drama has very little balance on the fatherly love. One is the ignore the child so that he can be moulded to be what he envisioned a stronger Emperor should be and the other two is the do all they could, even if it means killing others who may be innocent, to get revenge or to protect.\n\nI appreciate how injuries don’t just heal overnight. The Marquis still has his forehead injury.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hbd3xqxtyvuf1.png?width=1892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dbc151c7716f7b4d67886cab979862c84f017ae\n\nThe Empress and her lies.

    "title": "Final impressions of empresses in the palace",
    "content": "Well, about a month ago I started watching the drama about empresses in the palace and made a post with my first impressions. Now I've finally finished the show and will give my final opinions. I'll tell you about the entire series, including spoilers. First of all, I must say I really liked it, and it made me reconsider watching dramas about that dynasty. They didn't appeal to me because I don't like hairstyles, both men's and women's. However, this drama made me regret not having given it a chance. It has some of the best acting and female characters I've ever seen, and the story is incredibly captivating.\n\n Now, I must say that about halfway through the series, I got very bored. The episodes with Huan in the temple dragged on forever. I understand the importance of that arc, but I had to give it a 1.5x to be able to finish that part, although after returning to the palace, the series picked up its pace.\n\n\nI want to talk specifically about the villains in this story, especially Consort Hua, who in my opinion is one of the most charismatic villains I've ever seen. While I was hoping for her death, the series still managed to make me feel bad for her. After all, more than her own actions, it was her brother's idiocy that caused her death. Not to mention that the emperor was well aware of all her evil deeds, but he never bothered to stop her until she got a new toy. \n\n\nOn the other hand, I enjoyed the downfall of An Linrong, a two-faced woman who distanced herself from those who wanted to help her, only to end up in the hands of the empress, who saw her as a tool at best.\n\nBut without a doubt, the death I enjoyed the most was that of the emperor, the main villain—or at least for me, he is. He allowed and, to a certain extent, encouraged everything that happened in the harem. I almost started laughing when, on his deathbed, I asked, \"Why does everyone betray him?\" I mean, brother, who is listed in alphabetical or chronological order? \n\n\nOne question the series left me with was why Zhen Huan named his adopted son emperor. Was it because he thought the youngest was too young for the position?\n\nTo finish I want to vent about something that somewhat ruined my experience with the series and that is the damn SPOILERS, I mean yes, the series is old, yes, the series is inspired by a real character, BUT, my god that is no reason to be telling the whole story, if the discussion were on a Chinese social network then I understand, but I for my part did not see Chinese history as a subject in school and just because the series is old does not mean that everyone has seen it, in fact on the contrary given that the series is foreign and until recently Chinese series began to be popular. I found comments that were spoilers for me on reddit and Facebook but the worst without a doubt were those on Youtube, the comments section of the series was wild, I stopped commenting on the episodes because there was always someone who gave spoilers of the ending even in the first episodes",

Jicai wanted to give her some money and have her leave for her hometown, but Deyuan has nowhere to go and cries that she will do all kinds of hardwork without wages and even starts cleaning. The Shen Family is confused and takes Jicai away to talk.\n\nThe family tells her she's wounded and weak, besides having one more person is good for the restaurant who can help around easily. Jicai tells them that they are staying at Lin Yan's manor and doesn't even earn themselves, so how can they feed another mouth. But Jicai is still unconvinced and hearing that Deyuan leaves. \n\nInside, Lin Yan appears and understands Jicai's predicament so he talks to her privately. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/985vdr22juuf1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6dd43955a1311a2481e730ec5756c6e15456c8e\n\nHe tells her she's kind and warm and even risked herself to save Deyuan. He ensures he will ensure he protects her and the Shen family and that his manor always have room for them and even a few extra people. It started to rain soon so Lin Yan and Jicai goes to look for her.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g3cksszejuuf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff9789a3c2b6e8696af070f9338baaa84a805ad2\n\nAfter some looking around, Jicai finds her taking shelter and in the rain and brings her to the Shen manor. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbks2isojuuf1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38763a9912dfc5896f1e625683e297c9397d243b\n\n Deyuan gives Jicai a slave bond contract, but Jicai tells her she will work and earn wages like a proper employee. She announces her a family member at the dining hall. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dzucufyjuuf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28bcb09ca2156f1ab29aeb44f254fc7fbbed5c55\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/suzy9ms1kuuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bafae1984303c5b2219d20d62a914d14135e53d3\n\nLin Yan looks very proud of her. At the dining hall, when everyone talks about Pauper's joy (lard rice) and Jicai mentions it's something people eat when they go hungry, which the Vice Prefector can't understand because he never had to worry about food.\n\nBut Lin Yan confesses about living like a begger on the streets and going hungry, but too ashamed to beg for food. The Shen family feels pity, but Deyuan doesn't understand. The Shen family quickly changes the topic and discusses how Pauper's Joy can be included in the diner's menu, but it can be called ''Every man's Joy''.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ugbhmt7luuf1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f44cf74927bf5e7ae887b2c1d9e7305a202bc34\n\nThis gives Jicai the idea to open the diner for the common folks instead of the upper class, since they have nowhere to eat out. Yunlai and Guixiang only serves the noble, so Shen's Diner should target customers who are the common people with low income. \n\nManager Feng at Yunlai Tavern finds out the Shen Family is related to Lin Yan and that Shen Shaoguang is his distant cousin and thinks of using this information later.\n\nAt night, becuase the dinnar was late, the curfew started so everyone had to stay back at the diner. They prepare beds and curtains and even Lin Yan helps out. Lin Yan asks Jicai if he could talk privately and Jicai takes him outside while everyone looks on at them cautiously.  \n\n\nOutside, Lin Yan hesitates a lot and doesn't directly ask what Jicai thinks of their marriage and asks in a roundabout way about her future plans. Jicai figures out that the ancestor wants to annul the engagement and happily agrees. Lin Yan is dumbfounded. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/204m9bxhnuuf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75ec247bab0647de30b49a6e0c90b58b986ea31c\n\n[Poor Lin Yan doesn't understand why she is so excited to break off the engagement xD ](https://preview.redd.it/dkb9c1tlnuuf1.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cb4af4db5a68df703c8a3945140c771192f21be)\n\nLin Yan is even more dumbfounded when the parent Shens and Jicai write an annulment letter where they call it '' a violation of human ethics, a moral collapse '' and that all future generations will condemn this engagement 😂😂😂\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/se6ymvq2ouuf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84ac834585479b6c2e870bb73e5833e8586adc72\n\nPoor Lin Yan feels very much insulted 😂 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8n1ewqj6ouuf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e3d47d0b38c681a31c48279c9d429b82b7b4441\n\nNo, he feels very much wronged and mortified 😂😂😂  \nHe even asks himself if he is really awful to them xD \n\nHe can't bear anymore and peeps in towards the females side to talk to Jicai, but she is fast asleep. He hesitates and tries to go back when Jicai grabs onto his arm. He gets his arm out, tries to leave again when Jicai sees him and he falls down xD \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ol8cz65dvuf1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a679c770305e891d9d0c1a6ce77fc3f9c2e8ba8\n\nThese whole scene is so funny (ans sooo cuteeee) xD \n\nThey hear a cat and goes outside to find a little kitten which they adopt through a pet adopting ritual. Jicai even excitedly claims they adopted the kitty together when naming it (such a couple thing to doooo so cuteeee) but then quickly retracts and names the cat ''Xiao Ming''.\n\n[so cuteeeeeee ](https://preview.redd.it/dppf336anvuf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3edc47b8fb6d8c8aaf7d03311aa4a58864c284a9)\n\nBut Lin Yan points out that Ming is a synonym of Yan and they mean ''bright'', so Jicai gets embarrassed and tries to change it, but Lin Yan tells her too keep it.\n\nAlthough Lin Yan is a bit reluctant, but when Jicai goes xiaomingxiaomingxiaomingxiaomingxiaoming, he stares lovingly at her. \n\nYunlai Tavern gets punished and their extended part domelished. Manager Feng openly threatens the Shens of harm. Jicai conveniently announces the passerby as witness to his threats. \n\nSoon, the Shen's successfully open their restaurant.   \n\n\n**Episode 10**\n\nThe Shen's are smoothly running their diner, with full house visitors. Jicai even solves an ongoing fight between a furniture maker and a clotheshop owner with new business idea in mind. \n\nBrother Shen seems to have opened a therapy corner, with noble ladies lining up to ask for his advice regarding their issues - married life, weight lose, etc. and everyone is swooning over his handsome face. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8j557kykovuf1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c20fbba9c7684e3e04c15ddc0703915e53f69f7a\n\nInside Yangyang and Jicai is struggling, but they don't call him in so that he can busk a little in his newfound glory. Later, Jicai and Deyuan goes out for shopping and discovers Yunlai Tavern has copied all their names - from names to taste - and with only the half price!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hgtp0pegpvuf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc92ab8ad52f18f2ef4b3f4c91f5ccfa4f809459\n\nThe Shen's Diner faces an unforeseen calamity. WIth half price, all their customers have turned to Yunlai, leaving Shen Diner empty. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w7k2g5hnpvuf1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3b1d913633fd503289a51f679ec6f14b29c9c2d\n\nThe Shen family comes to know the culprit is Yunlai and they think of ideas on how to cope with the situation. With Jicai's absense, they truly try their best and comes up with the idea of copying Yunlai in return. But what Shen father cooks isn't edible. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5f5qcs8qvuf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1634f411e8a6067385d468f16a5891d3f033ee5\n\nSoon, Jicai returns with pork meat and a metal wok. They are going to come up with a special item, a signature cooking style, and their own IP - which is hard to copy. That new item is pork dish items. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rs95jm3osvuf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aae59082b6ecb61d50e231cfc358e52accea23eb\n\nHowever, in the ancient times, people don't eat pork, due its smell and its eating habit. But pork is cheap and value for money, also the metal pot can be used to blanch and then stir-fry the meat with spices. Then the pork dishes won't have any smell and will be delicious to it. \n\nSo with renewed zeal, they introduce their new dish ''Agate Meat'' and offers the passers by to come and try for free. But as soon as they realise it's pork, they don't agree to it and disperses. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hg3x3tmatvuf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfeb60f1284ea82614548d20ca89e50c2dcaeef0\n\nSo the Shen family wonders how to make the common people eat it, and they soon come up with the idea to have the noble families try it. The commoners usually follow what they nobles do and eat, and the nobles don't eat pork due to its bad reputation. \n\nSo how to convince the noble? Turns out, Shen Gongcai is useful indeed. \n\nThe noble ladies who used to line up just to get his advices gets invited for foodtasting. Shen convices them with lip service to try the Agage meat, while the commoners gather outside the door to watch. After much hesitancy, the noble ladies try the meat and instantly submerges into it with praises. Wattching the ladies savor the taste of the pork meat and eating deliciously, they also hurry inside, jumping to taste the new dish. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qy603zc9wvuf1.png?width=1101&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9390e26fab0bec3f084445dfb6c216cc5918e275\n\nShen's diner successfully overcomes the trial and the diner is once again full.  \n\n\nAn enthusiast even girfted Father Shen ''The Best Chef in Juxian'' title which the father-son duo places in front of the seating area. The father boasts that he is successful and Shen's diner can't run without him, when Mother Shen arrives. So, Son Shen asks if he'd continue to listen to every word of Mother Shen and he brag even more that no one in Yong'an can control him. \n\nParent Shens argue and fight, eventually the Father Shen gives up under her deathly stare and starts wiping the tables. \n\nIn the evening, Jicai comes to the Prefecture with dinner and serves Lin Yan pig trotters. Jicai imagines him messily and hugrily eating it, but surprising her, Lin Yan beautifully debones the meat and eats very neatly. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9wj43pfxvuf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef379f2f54dbca8edb9c91a5d351bfd367e75e10\n\nLin Yan was surprised Jicai brought pig trotters, but unlike the people of Yong'an he didn't have any prejudice around it. \n\nJicai calls him a good mana nd even mentions whoever marries him would be lucky, which makes Lin Yan remember the utter rejection and marriage cancelletion incident 😂 \n\nHe accidentally drops food on his lap and Jicai tries to wipe it off, but she can't exactly clean that area 😂 So, Lin Yan changes the subject and asks why they though of selling pork. \n\nJicai bluntly answers it's cheap and value for money for common people. Then he informs Jicai that some poeple has taken notice and is trying to create issue regarding selling pork. They imply that Yunlai has connection with the wealthy, possibly in court as well who are trading anonymously with the help of their relatives. \n\nSo, Jicai asks if Lin Yan wanted to see the Shen's win or those people. Lin Yan smiles and bets in the Shens. \n\nThat's the end of the episode. I think the episodes were quite fair in their pacing and story, the small romantic moments aren't pushed into our faces but its natural flow is quite cute. Especially, the cat adopting scene and the scene where Lin Yan ties a handkarchief on Jicai's wound. \n\nHow did you guys think of the episodes? ",

So before our fake couple has a chance to say “I do”, well wishers have descended upon Luosheng Forest. Among them is Tianji, who is definitely not wishing our fake couple well and has come to stop the wedding. And to tell Bozai that she will spread lies about him having betrayed Jixing Abyss if he doesn’t comply.  Bozai of course refuses to cave into the petulant demands of a woman-child.  Good for him!\n\nSeriously, this is getting embarrassing. While I don’t fault Tianji for using everything in her arsenal to gain the upper hand over Mu Qibai, the guy has refused you.  It’s time to move on. Ming Yi, ever the negotiator, is right when she said that Tianji should focus on the benefits of making a deal with them instead.\n\nSo as a compromise, Tianji agrees to let Bozai and Ming Yi marry on the condition that they don’t form the heart imprint and share divine consciousness, because that will…impact Bozai’s performance in the next Qingyun tournament?  Is this kind of like when athletes abstain from…you know…before a big game? (So I hear…) And isn’t this kind of like the princess telling them that they can get married but can’t consummate their marriage?  Where does this woman get off?\n\nBut since the whole thing is fake anyway, Bozai agrees, much to Ming Yi’s chagrin.\n\n[This is a bit self indulgent but I just can’t resist posting pictures of beautiful weddings.  Also I liked how she grabs a hold of his clothes when he catches her.  C-drama directors take note.  Gravity is real, even in xianxia realms.  ](https://preview.redd.it/8hllp02rvsuf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ffde05267442f8f4b8c1fb7892eb6e944bc4c2b)\n\nAnd where is poor Situ Ling while our lead couple plays house? Trying to buy something pretty for his 姐姐. Cue sad violin.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4c3p52p4wsuf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b75f82378ebd42b18b09f97606e4fd61bd75454\n\n# What Dreams May Come\n\nAs expected, Xun Ming shows up with puppet Zhang Tai in tow.\n\nNot as expected, Xun Ming is onto Ming Yi and Bozai’s plan.  His most treasured memory is not his wedding with Xinliu, but he lets Ming Yi and Bozai into his illusory realm anyway because in his illusory realm, Bozai’s spiritual powers will be weakened. He can then get Bozai to disclose the location of the Golden Millet Dream before he kills him.\n\nSo poor Bozai gets strung up while battling his inner demons. He sees his master, who tries to get him to tell her where the Golden Millet Dream is. But even in a weakened mental state, Bozai is too smart to fall for such an obvious trick.  He kills his master’s illusion instead\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fx8bj1v8wsuf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49d3a3e34a2f4849d2adf196d1d9442d5c5b35b2\n\nBut his grasp on reality is fading.  Ming Yi reaches him just as he is about to lose his sanity.  He almost kills Ming Yi!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eq5uu3hcwsuf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=418c766d425670b2c8ad9d8e095ba6bbbeb9cf96\n\nBut then Ming Yi says to him what Xinliu used to say to Xun Ming: “Whether you have true feelings for me or not, you are the only one I love.” And she kisses him\n\n[It’s not the most passionate of kisses.  But I’ll take it.  ](https://preview.redd.it/3j0koahgwsuf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=751bc63d403b0862a6e234b0f85fc21d4cac4317)\n\nAnd that allows them to not only see but live Xun Ming’s most treasured memories. The meet as Xun Ming and Xinliu, when she broke a string while playing the zither (or is it guqin?). They get married, but then Xun Ming starts suffering from backlash because he’s raising the netherbeast with his own body. Xinliu died while trying to kill the netherbeast to protect Xun Ming.\n\nAnd we get to see Hou Ming Hao spit blood while baring his chest\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2orw3llwsuf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37911efee3851ed9e691f52556b5a4179d834dcb\n\nBut wait, the truth is not actually as Xun Ming remembers it because Mu Qibai altered his memories.  XInliu never loved Xun Ming.  As a matter of fact, she hated Xun Ming for taking away her freedom and died while trying to kill Xun Ming.\n\nI must say though, that during the illusion sequence when Bozai lived as Xun Ming, Hou Ming Hao gets to exhibit more emotions than he did the previous nine episodes combined. Not his fault, because the script has him pretty emotionally closed off. But as the stakes get raised, I hope to see more range from him\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2bgzpatpwsuf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c2fa0ea2ef42e7353179bc5458221f9b5e9c9c3\n\n# Turning over a new leaf\n\nHow good of a wingman is our hot psychotic general.  Let me count the ways.\n\n❤️He possesses Bozai and uses mental telepathy to get Ming Yi to stab her fake hubby. But that forces her to grab the blade with her bare hand so it wouldn’t go into Bozai’s heart.\n\nI guess what this also means that in her heart, Ming Yi has come to terms with the fact that Bozai didn’t poison her.\n\n[I take back everything bad I’ve ever said about this angel.  And the way a single tear rolls down his cheek and the way he holds her bloodied hand…](https://preview.redd.it/dya6s29vysuf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a04f88dc39efc9db2e75c175a8a336903ac736b)\n\n❤️He collapses his dream world, causing Bozai to risk his own well-being to save Ming Yi and Zhang Tai. Mere minutes later, Ming Yi returns the gesture in kind when she refuses to leave Bozai in Xun Ming’s illusory world, even going so far as to use her spiritual energy, which I am sure would cause all sorts of backlash on her body, to get them both out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y8sdnhxj1tuf1.jpg?width=2466&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f27631aa731487c9cf80e7f925c09d005d287b3\n\n❤️Our unconscious newlyweds are discovered by our resident cutie pie, who removes the grief blossom from Ming Yi’s wrist.  Does this mean she’s cured? But she barely spared a thought for her pristine wrist after she wakes up. And what did Situ Ling mean when he says that he cannot let Ming Yi discover his identity?  What identity? How did he manage to remove the grief blossom so easily?  He doesn’t even have any spiritual veins.\n\nEither way, nothing works better than a life-and-death situation to bring a couple closer together. Once Bozai wakes up, Ming Yi asks him if he ever thought about poisoning Ming Xian. His candid reply about not needing to and that he considers being killed by the former champion an honor finally puts to rest any doubt Ming Yi has about his character, I think. She even said that Bozai is not an opponent but a 知己, which is kind of a cross between a close friend and a soul mate.\n\nSo does this mean we can finally put all the manipulation to rest?  Does she still need the Golden Millet Dream? It would surely suck for her to revert to her old ways especially after they end the conversation with the grandest of grand gestures.  He drinks the medicine she hands him. Because he trusts her…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpsqxa054tuf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d36d3b0e2aff9048c30c21e6e46883a302405469\n\nThe episode ends with the two engaging in some fake PDA for Situ Ling’s benefit. I guess now that the entire realm thinks they are married, they have to keep up the illusion. But they looked like they were having too much fun “acting” if you ask me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3on2tyb65tuf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3023db80bee804f61c4714eb00ad6012569442f\n\n# So,\n\nWhat did you all think of these episodes? It looks like we have seen the last of General Xun Ming. Secrets still abound, as Ming Yi doesn’t know that Situ Ling is the one who removed her grief blossom and Bozai think that he’s the one who got them out of Xun Ming’s illusory realm? Did he really buy Ming Yi’s vague explanation?  Either way, things are definitely picking up and I can’t wait to find out what’s in store for our newlyweds.",

    "title": "Really Late To The Party: Finished Watching Love and Redemption. I LOVED IT!",
    "content": "I have no one to talk to in the real world about dramas I’ve watched so please allow me to share my love for this drama even though I’m years late to the party!\n\nI thought it was a good story and I loved Yu Sifeng and Chu Xuanji. The actors had great chemistry. And I really loved them together. I felt bad for Xuanji because her life was not her own. She was &gt;!pretty much manipulated by others.!&lt; One thing I loved was that once it was revealed &gt;!that she was firstly, The God of War, her dad still treated her like a daughter. It was very sweet to watch.!&lt; Speaking of her father, that dude is in like every drama ever made. 😂 I’ve seen him in quite a few dramas so I recognize him.\n\nThings started getting really good and heavy around episode 35 or 36. These episodes until the end were my favorite. The last 10 episodes were outstanding as the story came together. I found myself glued to the TV. \n\nI liked the secondary characters, and there were a lot of them. I think after the main characters the Flying Snake was my favorite. While I thought Lord Teng She was annoying at first, by the next episode I had fallen for him. I loved his sass. He insulted everyone and had an inflated ego. I loved his arrogance. I loved that he was motivated by food. I loved how he’d get flustered and uncomfortable around crying women. But under all that he was a truly good snake and very honorable. I loved his friendship with Xuanji in the later episodes and how he helped her through that rough spot. I loved when he’d hiss at people menacingly. I loved that the actor incorporated “hiss” sounds in his speech. It really added a layer of depth to the character. \n\nI also liked the merman, Ting Nu. I thought he was kind, smart, powerful and beautiful. I also thought he should not have spent all his time on land in a wooden wheel chair when he should have been in the water since he is merfolk. But Splash was a good guy and I liked him when he popped up.\n\nI liked the Purple Fox but hated the golden monkey. I only liked how powerful monkey man was compared to others. I hated how the fox practically threw herself at him by becoming human and he didn’t care. He pretty much abused her when she was the fox. Then she goes in search of him because she loves him so much. Like GIRL. WTF is wrong with you?!? She finds him &gt;!chained up but he does not recognize her. Later, when he is free and regains his powers, he still pushes her away.!&lt; I think I would have liked him more if he didn’t do what he did to Purple Fox. It’s was only after &gt;!her death that he finally admitted his feelings. That pissed me off. And that’s why I don’t like him. She deserved so much better than him. After seeing how her death affected monkey man and how the emperor gave him a second chance, I really hope he is a better person this time.!&lt;\n\nWu Tong. I hated what he did to &gt;!LingLong. She had vitality, a love of life, strong opinions, and she loved her sect members and family. After what happened to her, she was just an empty shell of her former self. Trauma and abuse does that to a person. You start doubting yourself as a person. You doubt others and their affections for you. You push people away. You walk through life just going through the motions. Linglong’s friends and boyfriend told her it wasn’t her fault and while she knew that, it was still very traumatizing.!&lt; And when Wu Tong &gt;!come back for her during her wedding and lifted her veil, it was very hard for me to watch. It gave me anxiety. But I’m glad she healed in the end.!&lt; I think the actress did an EXCELLENT job portraying the character’s &gt;!trauma.!&lt;\n\nKing Bailing was just straight up &gt;!evil to the core. He betrayed the Devil Star. I guess he wanted the power of demons to protect his kingdom but couldn’t do it with Mosha. And the Jade Emperor told him to stop and he didn’t. Then Bailing sealed Mosha‘s soul in the crystal cup so Bailing could control him. Bailing also changed his gender to female so no one would recognize who he really was and called her the God of War to use her against the Asuras. And then the God of War found out. F♥️cking Bailing. What a horrible person. I’m glad he got what he deserved.!&lt; I loved and hated his character. The actor did a great job.\n\nI did like the actor who portrayed the &gt;!Devil Star.!&lt; he was really good. He wasn’t on screen for long but his short appearance was impactful as a character.\n\nThe downside to this drama was that it seemed like this drama’s secondary characters were only used when the plot called for it.  They would just pop up and I was like, “Where was merman? Sitting in his wheelchair staring at a wall until he was needed?”Also, in episode 41 we see the merman has this pet flying pig that helped the fox get out of a certain situation. Then we never see it again. Things just appeared when the plot called for it.\n\nAlso another issue I had was that there were 59 episodes and I didn’t feel like this drama fleshed out the supporting characters the way other long dramas have done. I like to be immersed in the story and ALL the characters lives. I wanted to see what actions Brother Liu took to get the Celestial Eye. I wanted to see his back story along with his daughter’s story. I felt that they could have been utilized more. But I was happy with his story at the last episode. I most definitely wanted more back story on Teng She!!!! \n\nBut other than those issues I had,\nI was totally invested in all the characters. I really enjoyed this drama. I loved the story. It’s definitely on my rewatch list! \n\nPS - For a fun drinking game for a rewatch party with friends, take a shot of your favorite beverage every time someone says, “Sifeng!”\n\n\n\n",

Can you blame me though\n\n[Don't come between a prince and his woman, emperor](https://i.redd.it/3ujo3nh0aouf1.gif)\n\nSuige was probably thinking in this scene: I kept a vigil at his bedside, worried about him getting killed then going missing for *this*?\n\nAfter Suige's explosive \"conversation\" with his dad, our prince is all worn out, so Yixiao demands that he sleep.\n\nIs sleep all you want him to do, Yixiao HEHEHEH\n\n**Night of slaps**\n\nXiyang got slapped by Jingshi.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/l3w6a7gwaouf1.gif\n\nMurong Yao got slapped by dad.\n\n**The Marquis is so disappointed**\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tpe2ioxfbouf1.gif\n\nLook at all these filial sons, using their fathers' retirement as a nice reason for treachery.\n\nLord Murong, it must break your heart to know that your son is a murderous, unprincipled bastard.\n\nI thought this scene when they had their argument, with Murong Yao arguing why he had to do this, was well done. The writers are absolutely good at writing scenes like these, and the actors execute them so well.\n\nAnyway, a part of me is glad that the marquis was honourable until the end of the scene, but when he said that he'll go ask the emperor to punish him instead, I groaned.\n\nKnowing what we know about what the emperor did to Prime Minister Zhuang, my man, that's NOT a good decision. Alas, I don't think the Marquis' principled stance is going to last long.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43hrehgubouf1.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc495872b7adc9600689dae10a69aefc5a8a5e18\n\nLater, the Marquis straps thorns to his back and basically knelt all the way to the emperor's room. But the emperor is NOT in the mood. (He's had a bad day, see.)\n\nThe Marquis gets no answer (come on emperor, that's cruel, stringing him along for so long), but I have a feeling, after listening to that speech by the prime minister when he was pretending to be asleep, the emperor has had a change of mind.\n\n**Well, at least some people are having fun**\n\nYes, darlings, our couple finally DID IT.\n\nOur couple went from tearing each other's flesh off to tearing each other's clothes off. I APPROVE OF THIS PROGRESS.\n\nIt's about damn time!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zvb7bemlcouf1.gif\n\nOH LOOK THE MAGICAL SPOTLIGHT OF LOVE HAS APPEARED! THE MOON GODDESS HAS BLESSED OUR COUPLE AGAIN.\n\nDirector Big Light, I don't know if anyone told you this, but did you know it's not healthy to stare directly at the sun?\n\nOk back to the important bits, for your viewing pleasure\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1o4oh9m/video/91ckba2cdouf1/player\n\nBut but but this scene didn't last long enough damnit.\n\nBut I love their morning after. The warmth and closeness is so natural.  I love how they combed each other's hair. SQUEE\n\nBTW, I'm so surprised Lu Ke didn't barge in - he's always there when they have PDAs lol. (But if he didappear this time, I think Suige would've absolutely annihilated him.)\n\nBut wait, we see him running down the corridor towards the room!\n\n[Gee I wonder where he went](https://i.redd.it/ugktsmfkfouf1.gif)\n\nuhoh lmao.\n\nDamnit Lu Ke did it again lmao (Why are you so lucky/unlucky? Do you have some kind of magical power, Lu Ke?)\n\nBTW, for some reason, I fully expected Suige and Yi Xiao to confess that they were virgins. I dreaded it with the fire of a thousand suns. I'm glad that the writers subtly indicated the opposite because if they had that \"I've not slept with anyone ever\" that would've been seriously cringe.\n\n**The empress is truly delulu**\n\nYou mean to tell me she never suspected that the emperor didn't like her or her family? So that little matter of her father cowardly stabbing the empress from behind was just a minor matter?  Man, I do like her sense of reality.\n\n**The emperor is regretful, but how much and about what?**\n\nWe see a very tired emperor by the end of episode 26. After demanding that Suige kill Yixiao, Suige storms out. Then, Doctor Ling barges in and tells him that the empress had begged him to save him.\n\nThis news shattered him, because I think he had thought that she had hated him at the end. He had learned to hate the woman he used to love, hyperfocused on the fact that she tried to ruin his dynastic plans. And all the while she was trying to save his life. Maybe that's how he convinced himself that this long 15 years hammering at his big plan to hone Suige into a perfect emperor was the right move. That piece of news shattered the last shred of purpose he had.\n\nLater, he has a conversation with himself and the ghost of the empress ... explaining why he had to do what he he did. He talks about his poverty-stricken life and the one lesson he learned from that life: *If you don't fight and seize, you die.*\n\nAnd then he asks: Am I wrong?\n\nAltogether now:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/85ojdam5gouf1.gif\n\nAh man, imagine working and fighting so hard for so long for the wrong goal, only to realise it too, too late. Your daughter has run off to a psychotic kingdom, your son hates you and has basically spat on the legacy you prepared for him by kicking away the edict pronouncing him crown prince. I feel a tiny bit sorry for him.\n\nI must say I really love this actor's soliloquies, and that long conversation he had with Suige. Brilliantly performed.\n\n**A potential menage a trois in Jinxiu - saucy!**\n\nOh ok, after that big slap, we see a glimmer of toughness come into Xiyang's eyes. It took her long enough for her to wake up.\n\nBut as much as I admire her new backbone, I don't think insulting the Jinxiu emperor was a good move. You're no longer in Susha, princess. You're powerless here.\n\nFunnily enough though, after torturing her with thorns, he tries to *care* for her. Our emperor is still an absolute whacko, but by god do I see some kind of affection in Xiyang's eyes?? Or am I hallucinating? Has she read too many \"reform the rake\" bodice rippers??\n\nBut on some tiny corner of my mind, I am like: INTRIGUING\n\nThis is going to be some messed up relationship but I'm seated here with popcorn\n\nXiyang is devastated to know that her father is sick.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ja9zjstzgouf1.png?width=992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5127e4d573ed6d7d25bb8b5dbdf233253d1af1b2\n\nI DON'T KNOW LEMME THINK\n\nIronically, it took the mad emperor telling her what she did to her family to make her realise that her romantic fantasies had bad consequences, including her father falling sick.\n\nJingshi was absolutely cold to keep this from her though. And when the guards manhandled her, he just turned away. He's an absolute irredeemable bastard. Babe, I know you don't like her, but she did save you from her brother's wrath, you know?\n\nDo you realise now, Xiyang, what Suige was trying to rescue you from?\n\nI may eyeroll at her romantic fantasies which led her to this predicament, but I really hope that she could destroy the brothers (and I strongly suspect she will in her own way).\n\nI hope she takes advantage of the emperor's interest in her, manipulate him and pit both brothers against each other and destroy Jinxiu! Oh well, pipe dreams. I don't think our princess is that smart or motivated.\n\n**The prime minister's final stand**\n\nThe prime minister stages a suicidal final stand, hoping to kill Suige in an elaborate trap.\n\nYay! We get to see the wolf pack finally do battle but unfortunately, it's a nasty one - some of the assassins pretend to be civilians, the assassins attack the civilians, it's a mess. The prime minister is obviously trying to frame the prince for a massacre so that the people will turn against him.\n\nCan I tell you much I love the fact that our couple literally slays together? This is a true partnership.\n\nBut, anyway, the prime minister not only failed, but he completely achieved the opposite affect because Suige gains the favour of the civilians when Xiyang, Doctor Ling and his people tended to the wounded and he paraded the PM on the streets of the city.\n\n**A messy end for the Zhuangs**\n\nChengyang joins the empress in begging for an audience with the emperor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h83zq2zohouf1.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41d16dc5a5f5b997225bd06108f53b5368bf7d1d\n\nPoor second prince, you are too pure for this world.\n\nAs he finally arrives at the throne room, Suige remembers his own ordeal while watching the empress being restrained.\n\nIn this fantastic scene, the empress begs for her father's life, and the emperor says: \"My condolences\", echoing what she said to him when Qingyu, his first empress died.\n\n\"Don't cry, smile,\" he coyly tells her. He's basically telling her to do what he did before - bottle up his grief and pretend to be happy.\n\nAnd the  final scene, the emperor screams: \"Zhuang Shen. You should die here!\" pointing to the very spot his wife had died.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlkfqzsyhouf1.png?width=1018&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8571efdc691f980535f029607c1b7cad3c91ef07\n\nWhat a powerful scene!\n\nIn an earlier scene, the emperor had said that he had kept the prime minister alive all the while so he could test and hone Suige. So that meant that he had the desire to kill him all this while.\n\nNow, he finally realised what he should've done years ago: Avenge his wife's unjust murder.\n\n**Previews for 27 and 28**\n\nBwahaha wtf producers how dare you leave us with these previews and make us wait 24 hours to see these episodes\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/q8pn6wodiouf1.gif\n\n**Questions to ponder**\n\n1. What do you think of our couple finally getting together?? Did it live up to your expectations?\n2. What do you think about the prime minister's plan to kill Suige? Personally I thought it was poorly executed.\n3. Did you think the emperor finally regretted his actions?",

You can find the previous discussion posts here: [Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o23nk6/yummy_yummy_yummy_%E5%AE%B4%E9%81%87%E6%B0%B8%E5%AE%89_2025_what_are_your_first/) [Episode 5-6](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o3d780/yummy_yummy_yummy_episode_56_discussion_post/)\n\nI'll keep my post relatively short today and let y'all share your favourite moments more because I fell sick from getting drenched in the rain. Really sorry for the late post, I know all of you are dying to discuss the episodes! Also, don't worry, I'll post the next two episodes tonight in a few hours as well.   \n  \nPersonally, I really liked episode 7 because of the &gt;!fireflies scene!&lt;. It was just so romantic and wonderful. Episode 8 has given us more depth into the plot, and I really like the steady progress. Also, a new character introduction! \n\nLet's drive straight into the episodes now. Be warned of spoilers!\n\nEpisode 7\n\nNow that it's finally full moon and the Shen Family has prepared the whole manor beautifully with carved bamboo crafts and lights, and cooked Spring Water Lamb for their ancestor.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezyr96lv1juf1.png?width=1111&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a2900120607e143c18e94e2192d57ad7ebe2c18\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56nfjo8h2juf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07603622b30cf6451a50965e9ac260f53f770820\n\nThe hypothesis was that as long as Lin Yan likes the lamb dish, after they go to sleep, they will be able to go back to the modern world. \n\nLin Yan joins them at the table and tries the lamb, which he compliments, saying 'delicious'. Is it only me, who half-expects once the food is in someone's mouth, the scene will transition to them overly expressing the taste, getting lost and dancing after the Bon Appetit, Your Majesty? \n\nIt's just that the ancestor's expression was so plain when he said it was delicious that I had to pause and laugh 😂 However, the Shen Family's rejoicing with victory scene was pretty chaotic, our ancestor was very surprised. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8374hwzodnuf1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e87c80a2e44dedfe2574fe7b3dfed9bcd1df218\n\nLiu Chan reminds him about dissolving the engagement, and Lin Yan is very hesitant. He goes on to say that he has an important thing to discuss, but the Shen Family beats him to it and announces that they will be leaving Yong'An. \n\nThey thank him, offer him gifts and also toasts to him to express their gratefulness. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lip2xlv2enuf1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f88b1abd66b6d96fafc02610b8f1b64ab4d48e6e\n\nLin Yan decides not to speak about dissolving the marriage, and is further sad when Jicai shares the rice tofu recipe. \n\nLater, Lin Yan takes Yangyang and Jiai to watch the fireflies by the Cang River. When Yangyang plays with the fireflies, Lin Yan wishes Jicai to be free, and Jicai confesses that she sees him as a friend with a warm heart. However, because Yong'an is a fleeting chapter and they don't belong there, Jicai didn't want to make friends. Lin Yan also says that he also didn't have friends.\n\nJicai laughs and agrees to not be friends (*so you're acquintances? couples? Married in future? what are youuuu???*) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/01d0rm3efnuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=701aae85bc4926d0fa1289d10f8c485438133dca\n\n[Lin Yan is very much in love. ](https://preview.redd.it/22094htkfnuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1e9140e1db271ef86943cc5e86cf82eb3722b6c)\n\nLater, the family gathered together to count their assets and reminisce about their time here in Yong'An. They are very happy that they can finally go back to the present time. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umn7ej5vfnuf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5932071153a20fab1ecbf38ea98310bf8b71208a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lna173uphnuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e45252507d8c92abd393acb056ce75660f3018d1\n\nLin Yan seems sad, a little reluctant even.   \n  \nHowever, in the morning, much to the family's horror, they didn't transmigrate. Much to Jicai's dismay, the Shen Family wishes to stay and make a living in Yong'An, and tries to convince her, but Jicai was very sad hearing none of them wanted to live. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mddwke83inuf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96c2140e70cff17f8dbe146b3e42b77989a7a36a\n\nLater, the family, one by one, brings food to their ancestor and tries to confess, but none were able to, so mother Shen comes and explains that for some reason they're unable to leave and will have to stay some more. She also says that they won't freeload and that they will open a diner and earn their own living. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/602l1cacjnuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1be6034801775d8cd9689dcd0698f85c26e22033\n\nLin Yan gladly accepts. I also really liked the playful Lin Yan, but as much as he is pleased the Shen family is staying, Liu Chang reminds him that he must dissolve the marriage to protect his identity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxr1l6hrjnuf1.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5fe6cb1d5746046295d39dc39fb68df0e10ac95\n\nLater at night, Lin Yan sees Jicai sitting alone in the garden and brings her an outer robe to cover. But Jicai dismisses him saying she just has trouble sleeping and she'll return a little later and returns the robe.   \n\n\n[Lin Yan can't see his fiance sad. He's soooo smitten!](https://preview.redd.it/m4jn2b18knuf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b660d7abaf83143413c0ed1e9631a5e03b58024)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzmfg6pfknuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad3c580a63bdefd1feaef2d349b79f9d2f1b99e1\n\nDid you also notice his hesitancy and nervousness when he fidgets? He thoughtfully shares that if she is in trouble, he can solve it. He opened up to her, but she was to upset to read the room. \n\nJicai couldn't exactly tell him what was really troubling her, so I understand her response. It made Lin Yan very sad, though. \n\nThe enxt day, Shen Family looks around for shops to rent, and decides on a shabby, rundown but spacious shop in cheap. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lvfjwbgdlnuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b7c5bb0cae957f805af548ec74b5b433b46c4b4\n\nLiu Chang and Lin Yan discuss the illegal expansion of the shops in Juxian Valley and how they have powerful people backing them. But as the Vice Prefect of the Capital Prefecture, he will crack down on all of them. \n\nLater, they bring Jicai to show the shop, but she is still in denial and sad. The family tries again, but she remains unconvinced. She can't understand how they could abondone their life in the modern times and decide to stay here in the ancient times, where they didn't even have freedom to roam around. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6a0fsx2mnuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5df32e58c45d07ba0fea112bda382973c6bb5ce0\n\nLater, she is sitting by the river for a while and when she stands up, a gust of wind blows a cloth on her and she slips. A young lady sees her falling and runs to help. \n\n**Episode 8**\n\nThinking that the girl who just fell is trying to kill themselves, despite not knowing how to swim, the girl jumps into the river to save Jicai, and nearly drowns. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpqzq1rymnuf1.png?width=1097&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9d4298d7e60b3a9ba75e06c9c4a8b71f5f0a18a\n\nJicai takes her out of the water and scolds her, but the girl only laughs and says that had she not jumped, she wouldn't have been able to save her, even if it harmed her, she would jump again. This kindness moves Jicai. The young lady takes Jicai to her tavern to give her a dry, fresh set of clothes. \n\nHowever, the girl secretly enters her home through a doghole, which surprises Jicai. They change into dry clothes, and the girl shares her name is Deyuan, and she was an orphan. She was a commoner, but she stamped in a slave contract and became a slave due to debts. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65zy0rk3nnuf1.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f853eefae11e33b3ec2d1927d8173ead5fff3d85\n\nDeyuan also sighs that Jicai was too thin and that she should eat more lest she couldn't defend herself in need. Jicai notices the tightly shut doors and the bruises on her, but doesn't question her. She was from Sh,u and she missed her hometown so they talk for a long time. \n\nAt the Prefecture, the staff are eating, and one of them asks if they should call the Vice Prefect but the senior just tells them to eat their own lunch. They are obviously insecure an young person is their boss, however, Lin Yan comes out and addresses them head on. \n\nMother Shen also appears at that time with lunch and helps of Lin Yan. Lin Yan seems like he appreciated the help and doesn't stop her when she convinces the employees that working together with Lin Yan is beneficial for them. Lin Yan also convinces them with enough power and authority that he will ensure they get back on track, gain reputation and also have an increased salary. The employees, convinced, jump in to eat the food brought by Mother Shen, gains respect for Lin Yan and even shares their lunch table with him. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5gy36x07ouf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0947934fb06e021879b8ee3a174d6c8097add9f1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/duyqdc077ouf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1bbb0d83b1d319a99c82b97ad9af8347f47eeb2\n\nDeyuan is soon hungry, and Jicai finds lard in her kitchen, so she makes rice husk dish with lard. Deyuan calls it 'pauper's joy' due its simplicity but tastefulness and ability to fill up their stomach. \n\nRight at that moment, someone bangs on her door and calls her out, Deyuan seems scared. She tells Jicai to go back from the way they came in and that they will probably never meet again. She also tells her to keep the clothes and bids her farewell. \n\nJicai doesn't think much and leaves. Later, at the manor, Lin Yan brings back the lunch box and meets Yangyang and Jicai. Jicai asks him if a commoner could sell them as a slave by stamping on a slave contract and Lin Yan explains that they must register themselves at teh Market Office and only stamping a contract doesn't make them a slave and that it is illegal to keep one like that. Hearing that, Jicai takes the clothes she got from Deyuan and runs to her. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yoqwsm8v8ouf1.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eced89b9cfeed02682eaead13c90600003a4ac7\n\nYangyang returns and tells Lin Yan that Jicai is unhappy and her last hope was Lin Yan but it's already in vein. Hearing that Lin Yan thinks she knows about him wanting to dissolve the marriage and asks Yangyang if she was aware. But Yangyang only says it was ok to break the engagement because it wasn't her first time, but Lin Yan thinks it all a jest and a child's ramble. \n\nAt Yunlai Tavern, Jicai discovers Manager Feng hitting Deyuan and gets scared. But upon gathering courage, she holds the clothes Deyuan gave her and walks in smiling, pretending to side with Manager Feng. She says she casually met her and borrowed her clothes and then tries to convince him that beating her up will only stress him and that she can teach the slave to be more inclined. \n\nBut Manager Feng gets alert and accuses Jicai to steal his slave, further scolding Deyuan that she had grown bold because she thought she had backing. He remains unconvinced and threatens Jicai to leave. She understands that there was nothing she could do and leaves, but then she grabs a stone and returns to protect Deyuan. \n\nShe threatens him that she will report him for faking the slavery contract and tells him to return it. But Manager Fang calls in guards and ambushes them. Just then, people from the Prefecture arrives and calls Manager Fang out. \n\nIn a flashback we see that before leaving, Jicai tells Lin Yan to send reinforrcement to Yunlai Tavern if she doesn't return and accuses them of illegally expanding their back alley. \n\nThe officers accuse Yunlai Tavern for illegal expansion and also blocking the road when bookshop caught fire in April which delayed the rescue. But Manager Feng denies it and even pulls out an ex-employee of the bookshop, asking if their was delay. All passers by standing their were scared to speak up and even the ex-employee denies knowing anything. \n\nLin Yan arrives and tells him their delayed rescue killed three people so Yunlai Tavern must be held accountable but Manager Feng accidentally reveals that there were no death but only one person burnt themselves. \n\nThen Manager Feng tries to threaten Lin Yan, saying they have important people backing them up so they should tread lightly. Lin Yan says loudly that he was telling him to patronise influential people by bending the law. \n\nThe officer also rolls in saying that was probably how they buried the bookshop fire incident. Cornered, Manager Feng stays silent and Lin Yan orders to demolish the expanded shop.   \n  \nLin Yan also goes in and sees Jicai ambushed and orders them to release them. The guards also get their asses kicked when Jicai tells him they bullied her. Manager Feng assuses her of stealing his maid but Jicai tells him how Deyuan was tricked into slavery.   \n  \nLin Yan gets the fake contract from Manager Feng with some probing, but he devours to destroy the proof. Lin Yan sets Deyuan free and Jicai leaves with her. \n\nThat's the end of the two episodes. How did you think of the plot? I really, really liked how Lin Yan asks her ''did he bully you?'' and angry-glares at Manager Feng when he tries to threaten her in front of him. Such a cutie!\n\n",

    "content": "Don't click on the video if you don't want to be spoiled, but it's super light in terms of spoilers and you've seen a lot more spoilers for the Fated Hearts in the trailers.\n\nWe had so many female generals this year, and you must be used to the common complaint \"she doesn't look/behave like a female general\". Some people think this is unfair, and that there's an expectation the actress must be muscular and brawny or look a certain way.\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nIt's all in the attitude, the body language.\n\nIn this clip, we see how Li Qin embodied the general role just by*body language*.&gt;! See how the men are looking her up and down, studying her like a rack of prized meat. Any delicate lady would be hugely terrified by their gazes, but Yi Xiao met their stares with a confident strut, and her eyes scream: \"F\\*\\*\\* with me, and you will pay\". Then, as she walked away, the threatening gazes switch to grudging admiration. Everything communicated with no words.!&lt;\n\nI won't mention the actresses whose generals didn't live up to expectations, but here are my favourite female generals/warrior women in Cdramas:\n\n\\- Ni Huang in Nirvana in Fire\n\n\\- Shen Li in Legend of Shen Li\n\nTo me, if an actor/actress can't embody the role of a general, it usually takes me out massively. I coped with Shadow Love only because I didn't take it seriously at all. But if the general role is important part of the story, I expect the actress to convey the right body language for the role. And that includes wielding weapons like she's used it for decades!\n\nWhat do you think?",

It’s a visual novel kind of story game where you will pick and choose different choices and just try to survive in the palace. The game is in a drama format, so you will be watching a drama and be able to decide how it goes. Too stressful? Don’t worry, you can always go back and correct your choices. The acting is so good and the game is so good.

May you wish to discuss the plots for episodes beyond that, and if you hint at spoilers, please use the spoiler tags. ⚠️\n\n**Episode 23**\n\nSo let's get the history straight first. Emperor Feng Pingcheng, Prime Minister Zhuang Shen and Lord Marquis Murong, along with the Late Empress and Suige's mother, were the founders of the Susha Dynasty. Though Feng Pingcheng was chosen to ascend the throne based on his qualities as a ruler, and Zhuang Shen and Lord Marquis stayed loyally by his side to build the empire from scratch, neither of their sons was as loyal as they were. They felt that they deserved much more; their fathers had been treated unfairly, and they wanted to be free from the clutches of the imperial family. Finally, we have a clear picture of the power dynamics. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kf3gbwciuiuf1.png?width=1913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b134a3893001bcaf8edb95366af5b5805710ad8f\n\nI loved how Feng Suige looked heartbroken here, yet every bit as fierce as ever. I also loved how the tables have been turned in one day. Up until yesterday, it was scheming, plotting and betrayal all around him, today he got them all on chokehold. The tug of war is on another level every day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0pylhs7viuf1.png?width=1915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2e4b83822deef4e5755a3e83d31e991e920fc66\n\n\"It seems like you don't understand what I am capable of either. If Feng Suige and I cannot leave here safely, your father's life will also be worse than death\". Yessss my girl !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqix13prviuf1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab1921ffc1b890ba8a7ae6432bda052acc11e09\n\nI am posting this screenshot because I don't understand what it is.

Even though I made peace with the fact, I am still crying inside.

You can be whatever you want and take whatever surname you want\". Oh to have such a man who admires you, respects you, cherish you and love you for the way you are! Feng Suige is setting new standards every day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sn5u39j1xiuf1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=933e665dfd784b670bbb3a5517a783cf44112d27\n\nI am dropping this here just to admire his palace. Warm lighting, open courtyard, so many plants, moonlight, rocking chair. What a dream house!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/skoojpicxiuf1.png?width=1914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a333d6c6ecb7b85fc713122bb46c718f11b3fc0\n\n\"I have only one Goal\".

Oh are we looking at a possible rift between Yao and the prime minister?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fw2y2wuwxiuf1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0881ed61d53b54a5a8db57555a21b1038bc71619\n\nI love how he don't give a damn about the public display of affection and silently but assertively states \"Behold my woman\". So very in character. Feng Suige my man!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmqmqti7yiuf1.png?width=1912&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9f28bbdbf5eeca0510f6d6b9f980a44cd7b24b8\n\nSo just like Murong Yao, the prime minister's son also wanted to break off free from the submission to the imperial family and establish their own land and rules. Our guess regarding treason was correct.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ez7g2imjyiuf1.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3daefafe84e67082bc4b1adc7a3fbd695789f14b\n\nOkay I agree that he is a psychopath, I am dropping this here to acknowledge his acting. He is great. He is handsome too. He sort of looks like the Korean actor Seo In Guk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5craxnywyiuf1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11e4fc5f5850e9fe6a427b8cc6d4057178101368\n\nOkay so Jinheng though he was plotting treason, the Prime minister thinks the emperor could have spared his life, only if he wasn't responsible for the late Empress's death. So it was indeed a tit for tat. We were right about that too. I acknowledge his acting as well. He carries the commanding aura and a deeply grieving fatherly figure really well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdwxex2fziuf1.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a380e2f01b4d489a3921a71ad08383aa8f0501\n\nYesss my tigress slays again! The way she walked out with all those Quonqi faction of the Feng battalion's fierce stare. That was lit. And she is back to her ombre red robe. Love it.\n\n**Episode 24**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/260wudsk0juf1.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbc95f6a1c9285133d12c3109225e15feaf63cc7\n\nI was really missing his subtle cold threats and death glares. This episode really delivered on it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5o271fox0juf1.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df19c11c5452ab6eee724d95fae6832ddd528f9a\n\nThis man indeed looks like a lunatic hehe. And very intimidating too. Why would Feng Suige have the Quonqi faction in his battalion? If only Feng Suige was interested in the throne, he would make a powerful and glorious emperor. But yea, I don't want that for him. Man deserves some peace. His youth has been dipped in deceit and backstabbing. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nexxpoch1juf1.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ffea89b370331cbd94d90e0d38121840a0d11f8\n\nLol the guard made a wise choice of not to get closer. We would have got to see another snapping of the neck with bare hands.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgwmym9w1juf1.png?width=1919&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14853e45d3fa7b996f7406e3c76347e10711752e\n\nI don't think that the emperor didn't realise that the princess was there for some other purpose, and she hid something in that book. I feel that he deliberately let it go. He may not be interested in ruling the land, but he is definitely intelligent.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r02stwla3juf1.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=362a4d28c97ca0b37441d73a2981a5415aedec13\n\nOkay, so we finally get to see what Feng Suige's mother was like. Free spirited, defiant, proud, valuing family over anything else. We now know who Feng Suige takes after. She couldn't come to terms with the emperor's power hunger and all that politics and scheming, so she decided to leave, taking the children with her. As expected of a free-spirited warrior. The emperor, on the other hand, wanted him to be a submissive wife, and his son to claim the throne. It's true when they say that not all men can handle powerful women. Daddy Emperor should learn from his son how to love a powerful woman the right way. I also admired Feng Suige's argument that Xiyang can become the empress and he will cut off the head of every single one of her enemies for her. Such a stark contrast. A father who looks down upon women and a son who admires and cherishes the women. I am loving how the leading women in this drama are carefully written. Also, kudos to the actresses who portrayed them as well. \n\nThough the emperor and empress might have ended up separated, I don't think he intended to kill her. Prime Minister Zhuang just grabbed the opportunity to secure the throne for his family in the future. So later, when his son was accused of treason, the Emperor just grabbed his opportunity to pay back. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2l47hp55juf1.png?width=1914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84d1a1b753139bb146c5cb568851fde276768c07\n\nYes man I agree, absolute power corrupts absolutely. You may have been a powerful ruler, but you failed miserably as a father. The episode ends in a cliffhanger with the prime minister revealing that he has raised the private army in secret at the fort his son gifted him. Turbulent times ahead.\n\n**What we still don't know:**\n\n1. Who are the Storm Alliance and who is leading it now?\n\n2. Susha is about to plunge into chaos. Suige has no interest in ascending the throne. What does the future hold for Susha? Will Suige be forced to take up the throne for the country? \n\n3. What is the deal with Murong Yao - Xia Jinshi collaboration and the death army? What is Xia Jingshi's grand plan?\n\n**Preview of episode 25 and 26:** \n\nI am not adding spoilers but it's going to be high octane action and passion and I am all in for it. Fingers crossed.\n\nOver to you.",

    "title": "The blubber-fest of The Wind Blows from Longxi",
    "content": "I have a habit of fast forwarding a lot of the drama I watch, and I recently watched the first ep and the last ep of The Wind Blows from Longxi (and maybe a little of the second ep). I even dropped the first ep many times cuz even though you can tell it's a compelling drama, you know it's going to make you sit up and pay attention because of all of what's being said, all of what's happening/the action, is important and though it might seem random at first, you get a foreboding that nothing is random (plus there seemed to be lots of people involved so I didn't wanna tax my brain).\n\nI especially do this (fast forward) because I'm not good at handling misunderstandings and especially when people go undercover. (Sometimes after I finish the last episode, I might go back to previous episodes I skipped, sometimes in reverse order. I'm OK with this because I already know the misunderstandings have been resolved and I don't have to worry about how much longer the misunderstandings is going to create bad mojo between certain characters.)\n\nI think that... no, I know that, judging people as good or bad is too easy; we all have good and bad in us, and especially if someone goes under cover, there's no way they won't form relations with the people they will be betraying. TWBFL is even \"worse\" because it goes even below the surface (so are we getting double or triple agent here?), so the twists and turns of the relationships and the warring sides makes it so heartbreaking for the MLs who are supposedly on opposing sides and even though I didn't watch the 22 eps out of 24, the last ep had me blubbering like a fool. (But honestly, since this came out in 2022, after viewing the last ep today, there was talk about things that I seemed to remember that had to have come out in the episodes in between the first and last, so maybe in the past, I watched more episodes than I remember.)\n\nI understand people sacrifice themselves for many reasons so that, plus the fact that it's a drama after all, makes it a little less devastating. I hope this doesn't keep people from watching TWBFL; I put this one right up there with Nirvana in Fire, or at least real close to it.",

    "content": "Welcome to another discussion of **Love in the Clouds**!  I think some of us have been getting a little impatient about Ming Yi and Bozai’s lack of progress in the romance department but I think we are finally getting some movement. And all we needed was a catalyst!\n\n[Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o11y5s/love_in_the_clouds_%E5%85%A5%E9%9D%92%E4%BA%91_2025_what_are_your_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) | [Episodes 1 - 5 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o2r9tt/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_1_5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)| [Episodes 6 - 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o3ijm7/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_6_7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) |\n\n# A Childhood Connection\n\nIs usually not my favorite c-drama trope.  But in this case it totally works!  Mostly because it’s not with the ML so it’s totally unexpected.  Situ Ling met Ming Xian back when he was a bullied thirteen-year-old with dirt on his face. He had snuck in to see Ming Xian fight in the Qingyun tournament and the young warrior was kind enough to spare a few words of encouragement for him. Ming Xian also wore his arm cuff during her fight and used it to fashion a bow and arrow, which is how Situ Ling recognized her and why he backed up her story when she killed the netherbeast.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hsjmf6834juf1.jpg?width=2059&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2eecd4f9535ba918dec9c6aee4d002cb72b299e8\n\nEvery time he calls Ming Yi 姐姐 my heart skips a beat .\n\n(姐姐 = older sister, or an honorific reserved for a female slightly older than oneself.)\n\n[“姐姐 do you remember this?  You are the most important thing to me in the world.  I will surely protect you.“ ](https://preview.redd.it/4ahl9ad94juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48ad2e8886196c1c975ede0f46b42f469c1d7e11)\n\nThen Ming Yi breaks his heart by refusing to acknowledge him. But mends his heart when she surreptitiously glanced around as if she is afraid that someone is listening. And the way he gets this hangdog expression on his face (You are stone-cold Ming Yi!) and then immediately perks up again with a mischievous smile on his face, and then gets all sad again when Ming Yi runs away…I’m sorry Ji Bozai.  But I totally want this drama to turn into an older woman/younger man romance now…\n\n[“姐姐 are you unwilling to acknowledge me? I won‘t tell anyone.”  And I just want to use a shrinking spell on him and put him in my pocket.  I don’t know if I can take any more cuteness from this guy…](https://preview.redd.it/7hgeq3eg4juf1.jpg?width=1393&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e785f5c2f28cfb079ad6b6100e3246a97c9298)\n\nThe directors or whoever makes such decisions also did Ji Bozai dirty by giving Situ Ling’s flashback montage the childhood-sweethearts-reunite OST treatment.  Just saying…\n\n# Where in the world is the Golden Millet Dream?\n\nMu Qibai gives Situ Ling a locator artifact and asks Situ Ling to conduct a household-to-household of the netherbeast.  What he didn’t tell Situ Ling, of course, is that the artifact is actually designed to locate the Golden Millet Dream. And when Situ Ling’s search led him to Wugui Sea, Ming Yi figures out the artifact’s true purpose and directs him and to Bozai’s treasure room.  She is then able to manipulate events that result in the artifact getting destroyed and Bozai’s treasure room getting blown up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rn9zqfbe5juf1.jpg?width=2413&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0166201fb22126dab66e83fa5a7d8019d150bc3\n\nSitu Ling, meanwhile, doesn’t forget to put the moves on Ming Yi every chance he gets.  His tactics include:\n\n❤️The slow-mo walk-by and the we-have-a-secret-connection look as a harp plays in the background.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5nckqrvz4juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9802d94aa9c5509d32e8d7294b748a0431d83748\n\nWhich confused Ming Yi while Nanny Xun remained impressed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf95m4ti5juf1.jpg?width=2433&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6904fac406623ccd47e92dc78e322ab70c4c02\n\n❤️Trying to flat-out buy her.\n\n[Ji Bozai: “What do you want to do with my person?” Situ Ling: “She has no title or rank. How is she yours?  Did you buy her?  I will pay ten times the price.”  Ji Bozai: “Dream on.” ](https://preview.redd.it/kbr8if0t5juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95cba798cbe69c4ac4ee276c7da254c8a7a3aff0)\n\n❤️Channel his inner green-tea to elicit sympathy. Bozai didn’t push him that hard.\n\n[“I am sorry Immortal Ji.  I burnt down your treasury.  You have every right to take it out on me.” I guess this guy is not as harmless as he looks. ](https://preview.redd.it/zf2wgpoz5juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68cedb05ef6a7ed74f72b81c47910e37fe01f265)\n\n❤️And he really needs to stop calling Ming Yi 姐姐 or I am going to contract arrhythmia before the drama is half over.\n\nAll the shenanigans do get Bozai riled up a little. Ming Yi thinks he’s mad because his treasure room got burnt down.  But he’s really just jealous, as Ming YI soon realizes and points out.\n\nBozai also called Ming Yi “family”.  Aw…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9b7kjrd6juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c15fa27fbc4a2d73694db65bb9ab8c572cfbe5c9\n\nMing Yi then presses home her advantage and suggest that they get married. But instead of agreeing, he just showers her with more jewels and valuables instead.\n\n# Saving Zhang Tai \n\nMing Yi’s bestie is getting married!  To General Xun Ming!  But when Ming Yi and Bozai go to see her at the Moonlit Blossom, Ming Yi realizes that Zhang Tai is now a puppet. Xun Ming has extracted her seven senses and trapped her in illusory realm. The only way to save her is to find out what Xun Ming’s most treasured memory is and re-create it.  They will then be able to enter Xun Ming’s illusory realm and pull Zhang Tai out. \n\nSide note:  I am glad to see such genuine friendship between Ming Yi and Zhang TaI  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0u2eszaa1juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b5d7aa2bfbf30be8023f1499cd2884b52314d2d\n\nAnother side note: When Ming Yi asks Bozai to help her save Zhang Tai, I feel like it’s the first time I’ve seen her being real with him and not putting on some kind of act. \n\n[“Thank you my lord.”](https://preview.redd.it/5uvaqki12juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa77462c1da55ee48c2dc7820c7c3dac9c1ab007)\n\nAnyways. So Ming Yi‘s primordial spirit talks to Zhang Tai and finds out that Xun Ming was married to a woman named Mu Xinliu, and he remains so in love with her that he makes other women re-enact their wedding over and over again. Mu Xinliu, as it turns out, was Mu Qibai’s cousin. So the only way to save Zhang Tai is of course to hold a wedding in Luosheng forest where Xinliu’s bone was buried.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/thi39ufzziuf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68748168aa92d2f2dcabcc8e6c6c2ae1be989643\n\nHum…I wonder who get to play the bride and the groom. Buxiu and Granny Xun?  🤨 Ha…who are we kidding here…Although I thought it funny that Buxiu didn’t bat an eye when Bozai suggested that he weds Granny Xun…\n\nThus Ming Yi find herself proposing to Bozai again.  Bozai agrees this time after much hemming and hawing because it gives him a chance to kill Xun Ming. I guess that means he’s using Ming Yi again. But honestly, since every time he ‘uses” someone is always just when their goals happen to align, I tend to give him more of a pass than when Ming Yi tries to pull something. \n\n[“Let’s get married, my lord.”  “All right.” ](https://preview.redd.it/4e30mvod3juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4678457fc607ed68b70dd2d8469e32d1911588b8)\n\n \n\n# Other Notable Developments/Observations\n\n📝Situ Ling asks Ming Yi if she’s at Wugui Sea to kill Bozai.  Of course, since he knows her real identity he is also aware that her reason for being with Bozai is not as innocent as it looks. I guess it is another shared secret between these two.\n\n📝Despite telling Ming Yi that her secret is safe with him, Situ Ling turns right around and tells it to Fuyue.  But I can’t even be mad at him because he tells Fuyue that as long as he can protect her, he is willing to take on the six realms. He’s also been looking for her ever since she disappeared.\n\nBut it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that Fuyue obviously harbors feelings for Situ Ming.  I wonder how that is going to shake out. \n\n📝While researching Mu Xinliu’s identity in the Langhuan Pavilion, Bozai and Ming Yi ran into Situ Ling.  Bozai really didn’t like the way Situ Ling keeps on calling Ming Yi 姐姐 and suggested that he Situ Ling call him 姐夫 (brother-in-law).  I feel vindicated.  \n\n[“姐姐?”](https://preview.redd.it/8zxpn20l3juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=243a6c912fe9a9d9fc35f56de3858d7265932e07)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tov38yyi3juf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2591e7ddcdf2b3f45d2c410dac57059365394359\n\nSo…does this mean we get to see a wedding in the next episode?  Oh be still my beating heart…\n\n",

    "title": "Love In The Clouds- your thoughts?",
    "content": "Love In The Clouds had aired on Oct 8. The cinematography is soo good. It has a somehow darkish cinematography, but not as much dark like MJTY or FoF. I think the actors are doing really good job so far. Neo Hou or Lu Yu Xiao really compliment each other, they are not overshadowing each other.\n\nI first saw Lu Yuxiao in MJTY and she was really good for a not-so-popular actress back then. As for Neo Hou, he has been improving so steadily. I saw him first in \"Back From The Brink\" and cannot help comparing his acting in LITC. He has improved so much in a short time of 2 years.\n\nSpecial shoutout to supporting leads as well. They each are doing so well in their respective roles. And how is everyone so good-looking?\n\nAnyway, this is kind of a slow paced drama. The main storyline kind of started in episode 4-5. As the original novel reader, the story has changed A LOT, but for the better (For me personally)\n\nSome drastic changes: (Contains major spoilers from the novel, but story changed a lot so, these things may not happen in the drama at the first place, I also only mentioned the differences of things which have already heppened in the drama, so no major spoilers of the drama) In the novel, &gt;!Ji Bozai was an actual womanizer, not just pretending. He had his way with many women and then threw them away once he got bored, that's why Ming Yi could enter his home so easily. They also got intimate in the first night and continued to be intimate physically, not like the drama, where both tried to stop intimacy.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The world in the story looks down at women a lot, Ji Bo Zai was kind of looked down on women originally. Golden Millet Dream was not a big deal as far as I remember. Companion beasts also couldn't transform into a human form. 27 or Er Shi Qi and Bu Xiu - both were human subordinates of Ming Yi and Ji Bozai respectively. 27 hid in Wugui Sea and he was not a silly child like in the drama, he was a serious and quiet young man who only listened to Ming Yi. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Yan Xiao was not an enemy like the drama. They were considered friends, but later in the novel, Yan Xiao was revealed to be a spy and Ji Bozai knew from the start. But he didn't harm Ji Bozai so Ji Bozai didn't expose him either. Ji Bozai and Ming Yi held their wedding at the very last in the drama. Also, Ming Yi never fought Ji Bozai in the novel as her poison activated before the tournament and she didn't attend and fled to save her life. So she knew that Ji Bozai didn't poison her. She went to him for antidote as well as another major reason. Lastly, Ji Bozai was a true jerk in the novel. When their manipulations stopped, they loved each other and basically, everything was cleared up, Ji Bozai actually married another woman without Ming Yi knowing for political reasons, Ming Yi came to know after a whole year. Mind you, they were together back then honestly. Also, one time, Ming Yi also caught Ji Bozai with a maid- doing Idk what, but definitely not something proper yk. !&lt;\n\nSo, all in one, I'm satisfied with the changes in the drama. What about you guys? Those who have read the novel- are the changes good or bad to you? Those who haven't, are you liking the drama? And those who dropped the drama, what was your reason?",

I think it would be quite interesting to explore his past or dive into his future after his &gt;!sacrifice!&lt;. Li Lun was such a lovable character, in my opinion.

I really enjoyed reading all the insights and the things I missed.\n\n[Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o11y5s/love_in_the_clouds_%E5%85%A5%E9%9D%92%E4%BA%91_2025_what_are_your_first/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) | [Episodes 1 - 5 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o2r9tt/love_in_the_clouds_episode_discussion_episodes_1_5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)|\n\n# I volunteer as tribute…or not…\n\nContinuing with my Hunger Games reference, in Episode 6, we have Jixing Abyss’ most elite warriors competing for the honor to represent their realm in the next Qingyun tournament.\n\n[I am using the term “elite” ironically, because a sorrier bunch of “warriors” you will not see..](https://preview.redd.it/kap4ge64sduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba2289ff4fd6eda7ab66b27ae55b80ee08e1a4ca)\n\nBut the real drama is happening off the competition stage, as Bozai first riles everyone up by bringing Ming Yi as his plus 1, and then wearing one of her flowery hair ornaments as his lucky charm when Ming Yi is refused a seat at the table.  I can’t really tell if people are upset because his actions are tantamount to slapping Princess Tianji in the face, or because they all subscribe to a brand of toxic masculinity that frowns at a man putting a flower in his ear. My bet in on the latter.\n\n[So frequenting the Moonlit Blossom and living in sin with Ming Yi \\(or so people think\\) is okay.  But bringing her to an event and wearing a flower in his hair is scandalous.  The hypocrisy is real…](https://preview.redd.it/8chet2hbsduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f1a85c208b86a1835d41e7adc67b3c2812cbb5a)\n\nIn either case, the incident ends with Tianji agreeing to let Ming Yi stay and leaving the courtyard in tears. Or did she?  I admit to being a bit confused here because one minute she’s crying, the next minute she’s laughing, and the next next minute, she’s…poisoned herself?  But never fear, because with physician Xiao Yan’s superior medical skills, he is able to rid her of the poison and get her back on her feet so that she can announce the warriors who have made the Qingyun tournament shortlist like nothing has happened.\n\n[These two continue to torment each other and I am all for it. ](https://preview.redd.it/95ovsvmjsduf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbddc789e068b629180e786a2e4e4643fa506014)\n\n[The way she gave Yan Xiao the side-eye when asking both him and Meng Yanqiu to participate in the warrior selection is quite funny. ](https://preview.redd.it/qi2f375qsduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26daa5519e37441df23f84ad5aad7ce2ab3457f9)\n\nExcept that the list is actually not the final list, and other than Sun Liao, none of the warriors who made it on the list actually competed, and some of them are not even warriors and have no spiritual vein (Yan Xiao), and at least one of them do not actually wish to be on the list (Yan Xiao again)…\n\nI guess you can say Tianji is a progressive looking to reform an antiquated system.  But I thought that the Qingyun tournament is a combat competition?  Or does it have non-combat categories like weapon forging and medical skills?  And did Tianji poison herself to showcase Yan Xiao’s medical skills because she knew he was going to object to being enlisted?  If so, that’s quite the gamble if you ask me.  I just have…like…so many questions…\n\n# The Case of the Blood Pearl Bloom\n\nAfter the try-out, Emperor Mu Yuanfeng finally makes his long-awaited appearance, and this is when the former chief of the Justice Hall arrives to confess his crimes per Bozai’s directive\n\nHou Zhao confesses to using the prisoners in the Sunken Abyss to manufacture Heavenly Grief and Golden Millet Dream. But having only obtained half of the Bo family’s medical text, he is only able to successfully produce Heavenly Grief. His daughter Ruo Shui then arrives to accuse him of abducting innocent victims and imprisoning them in the Sunken Abyss, and that the toxic runoff from his pharmaceutical enterprise has polluted nearby villages.\n\n[Bozai was one of the slaves forced to churn away at Heavenly Grief.  Is that how he contracted the poison and grew his spirit veins? ](https://preview.redd.it/1zxgevgxsduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3377f58bfdfb063420ff93703faea5f52713e98c)\n\nThen, in a surprising move, Rui Shui calls upon Ming Yi to bear witness to Hou Zhao’s crimes because her fake parents lived in Freezing Hot Water and died from the Blood Pearl Bloom poison. (I had wondered how she came by her fake identity…)This further convinces Ming Yi that she is nothing but a chess piece in Bozai’s game.\n\n[Ever the cunning one, Ming Yi decides to go with the flow and join the rank of Hou Zhao’s accusers.](https://preview.redd.it/x6yzed94tduf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a4ae34f4214bfa293c6f8438348c213b12e20c)\n\nBozai’s plan to oust Mu Qibai as the mastermind behind it all is ultimately foiled when Yan Xiao causes the emperor to faint. Hou Zhao becomes the patsy and is sentenced to death by lightning, and Yan Xiao may as well be scorched by lightning after seeing the look on Tianji’s face.\n\n[The face of a guilty man.  Still, I am glad he didn’t do something really irredeemable, like killing Hou Zhao, which I thought may have been his intention. ](https://preview.redd.it/8oir2skbtduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96cd21dece81e2aa01c5f71649d3a75d0567df9b)\n\n[She’s onto him! ](https://preview.redd.it/o3cep4whtduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06b82146ef9a5b8cbcfb8ebb4a131bf930ea6340)\n\nBozai, however, did make a case for himself by stating that he’s liked in Sunken Abyss for as long as he can remember.  So what crime could he possibly have committed?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77drakpntduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c94ae7f09b6452f15ad614af34aabfc22d0bd903\n\n# It was beauty that killed the beast…\n\nDespite their having done a good service for the realm, they have broken the laws and accused someone of a higher rank!  Thus Ming Yi and Ruo Shui find themselves suffering through the hanging punishment.  Ruo Shui literally spends the entire day trying to convince Ming Yi that Bozai is a good person.  But Ming Yi won’t bite.\n\n[“He’s a good man.” “I don’t believe you.” “No, he really is.” “You think so.” ](https://preview.redd.it/ekk5uwhptduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad6913ebc9b9474c8a6e630bc92ee49514d9d516)\n\nAnd then a netherbeast - something that is thought to have been extinct for a hundred years - shows up to kill them.  Ming Yi uses her spiritual energy to kill the beast, resulting in her losing one petal from her Grief Blossom. A steep price to pay perhaps.  But she sure looked good slaying the beast…\n\n[I want to see more of the badass female warrior, not that the girlie Ming Yi is not cute as a button…](https://preview.redd.it/8vf2yxvvtduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=506892feae9f7663ed91e07d87bc4d601cdb7261)\n\nPlus it got Bozai to stay by her bed side the entire night. I may be wrong, but at this point the relationship feels rather one sided.  Bozai seems to care more about Ming Yi than Ming Yi cares for him…\n\n[How can any hot-blooded woman not be touched?  Although I’d probably have trouble falling asleep with a good-looking man staring at me…](https://preview.redd.it/0xq4epf1uduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bba995130d9cf13b5ccc4a97c2c221892926ad5)\n\nUnfortunately for Ming Yi, the entire scene is witnessed by Situ Ling.  But fortunately for her, Situ Ling decides to corroborate her story when she lied and said that Situ Ling is the one who killed the beast.  I wonder why he decided to help her, and how this is going to come into play later.  But judging by his reaction at the end of the episode, will Bozai find himself with some competition for the lady’s affections?\n\n[Is this the face of a smitten man?  ](https://preview.redd.it/jpv87dn7uduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbb08dc3e546984d4bc7dd601a0228fab3024349)\n\n# The Game of Cat and Mouse Continues\n\nHou Zhao finally pays for his crimes.  But before his soul is scattered to the six realms, Bozai and Buxiu arrives to give him a heavy dose of reality and, really, to gloat. He is not some loving father he likes to believe himself to be. As a matter of fact, to ensure a prosperous family line, he had offered Ruo Shui as sacrifice to the Divine Tree. The spell he put on Ruo Shui ensures that as soon as her withered bone disease is cured by the moonshade grass, she will go mad.  The bastard…\n\n[Always nice to see a bad guy get his comeuppance…](https://preview.redd.it/hoc888oauduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c35745aec6b06424d19e92b14cd4af8e82ae6875)\n\nUnbeknownst to Bozai, the entire exchanged is overheard by Ming Yi, who is now starting to doubt that Bozai is the one who poisoned her even though he is still not entirely above suspicion. Finally! But I think she is just stating what she has started to gather all along, that Bozai is not the ruthless villain she believed him to be. He is not even a philanderer!  There have been clues!  For Bozai’s part, he’s starting to develop a guilty conscience that he’s used Ming Yi.  So he does the “I have a friend” ruse and asks Bu Xiu and Granny Xun for advice. Will we get to see their fake act develop into something real soon?  I sure hope so…\n\nBut in the meantime, our future lovebirds still has quite a ways to go, as Ming Yi points out that positions dictate that they remain enemies. I had forgotten that she still wants to marry him…So she goes back into her ”manipulation mode” and acts all cute and gifts him a jug of wine.  And even though he never drinks wines not brewed by himself, he accepts it!\n\n[How can any hot-blooded man resist this face? ](https://preview.redd.it/0op8qw9fuduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86191103e2caa4cc3d5c54a5e785fd18f66e7395)\n\nAnd I do a happy jig, and comes back to earth with a thud as I find out that Ming Yi did something with the wine.  Hum…what did she do with the wine?  Oh, who cares.  Because we finally get to meet the man with the sexy lips.  And that is General Xun Ming, who is summoned by Mu Qibai to perhaps kill Bozai.\n\nBut how did Ming Yi know about Xun Ming?\n\n[I know I should hate this guy on sight. But it’s..um..difficult…](https://preview.redd.it/g202rw6iuduf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e01b41f16726fe1c3c44d2a36e5fcfaeb0ece2bc)\n\nSo now the stage is set for more games of seduction, games of power, and whatever else the writers have in store for us.  What do we all think?  Still having fun?  Sound off in the comments below!",

    "title": "Yummy Yummy Yummy Episode 5-6 Discussion Post",
    "content": "Hello! How have you all been?\n\nIt's great to host Yummy Yummy Yummy as I've been excitedly waiting for this drama to air, especially after WDBTD, I'm in love with Wang Yinglu! \n\nThis is also my third time hosting a drama, so please be patient and guide me in case I'm doing something wrong!  Along with me, u/sequesteredself will also be co-hosting, so I'm really looking forward to these episodic discussions!\n\nThe first four episodes have been such a ride! They were so enjoyable that I couldn't hit the pause button, and I binged-watched all of them together. One thing I wasn't prepared for was all the cooking scenes, I was so tempted by food that this time I actually cooked some dishes before starting the show and watched while eating lol \n\nLet's now dive into the episodes right in! Be warned of spoilers!  \n  \nThe show starts with the hint that Lin Yan is very interested in joining Princess Fuhui's Qixi Banquet, while also considering breaking up the engagement with Jicai to not implicate her and her family in his family's matter. He also allows the Shen Family to borrow anything they need, which is fully taken advantage of by the said family and takes almost everything away for their stall😂  \n\n\n[''They were certainly polite'', he is so sarcastic 😂😂](https://preview.redd.it/w3cs8jeb9cuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f2ebb0d820c54fb3620670eb47aea276e225bb2)\n\nTo my pleasant surprise, I find Li Yunrui very refreshing and mesmerising in this drama; his expressions are really good and expressive, sometimes even funny. I somehow keep remembering Song Mo, but these two people are so, so different! Li Yunrui truly is an amazing actor. \n\nNext, Jicai faces trouble in business as their competitor copies their recipe and are selling a better version of the pancake in lower price. Their business doesn't do well and they retire home, taking the competitor's pancakes for their ''family meeting''. \n\nEveryone finds them tasty, even Lin Yan. He even retracts calling them tasty, seeing Shen Jicai sad (*awwwww so cute, already sensitive to her likings and dislikings hahaha!*) and tries to comfort them. But Shen Jicai tells him not to comfort her and comes up with a new plan.\n\nTheir next plan is to sell lamb skewers, unique to the people of ancient times, and the buyers line up! I really loved the snail-style stall and the mic head and absolutely amazing how the screen showed live selling feature 😂😂😂\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9t9g76pacuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34b3b1e86f62dda14142d01ce2be2f6103f96416\n\n  \nThe funnier part was that they took all the lambs from their ancestor and sold them for only 10 yuan 😂😂 Lin Yan felt might have felt really guilty 😂\n\nNext, Censorate Pei takes Lin Yan to try the lamb skewers of the Shen Family, unknown to the fact that they are acquaintances, and accidentally witnesses the competitor restaurant people bullying the Shen family.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19bqi7z6dcuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9575380be953d0c5ecc32a05ac01dbdc749652bb\n\nJust when the goons were about to throw everything, Lin Yan steps in ( *we know, you wouldn't let anyone lay a hand on your lady, would you?* 😂) and rebukes them for trying to control the market. They realize who Lin Yan is and make excuses to run away. \n\nMother Shen accidentally calls Lin Yan son-in-law, which the Censorate overhears and presses Lin Yan to admit the truth. At first, Censorate Pei doesn't agree to marrying a merchant's daughter, but upon tasting the lamb skewers (*and finishing them lmaoooo*), he starts singing praises for Jicai 😂\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7z56zmcdcuf1.png?width=1105&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdbe97858fb4486bb2be8b4c7910401aa39708db\n\nIt must have been very funny to Lin Yan 😂 \n\nAt night, the Shen Family is rejoicing earning so much money and plans to become more sutainable and time-effective and decides to sell drinks along with the skewers. The next day, we see various sets of drinks with unique idioms as names being sold at Shen's Diner.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtdd071qdcuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15e0e3e7d148520f81c6a2c706b09daa63caa20d\n\nCensorate Pei gets a lamb skewers treat from Lin Yan, who trickily asks why he wanted an advance payment and if he faced any hardship. Pei confesses he wants to buy a selk outfit to fit in at the Princess's Qixi banquet. Lin Yan cleverly suggests buying him one, but Censorate Pei refuses, but quickly suggests of lending one from Lin Yan's clothes.   \n\n\nThis opens up Lin Yan's opportunity and he earns Censorate Pei's word to receive an invitation to the banquet as well. He also receives an offer for the Shen Family to cook for the banquet. Lin Yan looked fairly interested (and invested because of course, our ML has to look out for his girlfriend's earnings 😂)  \n\n\nThe drinks are superhit! Buyers line up, and Shen's Diner is completely sold out! Later, some military men come to the stall and offer to have some barrels delivered, to which Jicai refuses because military rations are strictly state-controlled; however, she also suggests selling the recipe to the military since they'll leave Yong'an soon. Besides, the military works hard to serve the country and people, so they deserve to try the best teas of Yong'an. The military general is impressed by her bold idea and buys the recipe. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzerthrsecuf1.png?width=1106&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c18ed77984fca049477e04240d046623964003f\n\nFrom far, Lin Yan also witnesses and admires Shen Jicai, saying that had she stayed in Yong'an, she'd become a good merchant. \n\nHe walks up to the stall and Shen Jicai makes him say the phrase ''Find an ideal husband, Ultra cute maiden purple'', and being unfaily played, Lin Yan gently strikes on her forehead and calls her name intimately, which completely takes Jicai by surprise. \n\n[THIS WAS SOOOOOO CUTEEEEEE](https://preview.redd.it/mtlrib0agcuf1.png?width=1098&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c91c28262ab4b6af23eff1f6b9955d9fb897746)\n\nAnyways, Lin Yan offers her to become the chef at the banquet.  \n  \n**Episode 6**  \n  \nThe Shen family at first disagrees to stay out of trouble, but hearing the pay is in gold bar, they agree readily. \n\nShen Jicai is preparing the flower desserts in the kitchen and realises her brother is again bunking work and being lazy. She comes to fetch him for work and even tries fighting, but the lazy brother just pretends to sleep or hurt to avoid the hardwork.\n\nJicai comes back to the kitchen and hears someone walk in. Thinking it's her brother, she tries to knock him with the roller, but Lin Yan stands there.\n\nHe says he came to check on how the food was being prepared since he was the one who recommended them, but honestly, he was just watching his soon-to-be girlfriend and admiring the Beauty cooking. \n\nNow, this here was just sooooo swooooningggg!!!! Did y'all blush?!? I think I kicked and rolled around with giggles and all becuase the next part was sooo cute!\n\nLin Yan gets flour on his face and Jicai gets them all off - touching his face, lips and whatnot and TAHT LOOOOK !! HOT AF !!!\n\nLin Yan is definitely falling, if not already in love with herrrr  [😩](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=679517c3ba0a5d08&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifNnotHVfbFCfcH3Diu-3Xm-jzGbPw:1760128566962&amp;q=%F0%9F%98%A9+Weary+Face&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJvvjvvZqQAxUJcGwGHaIDK_sQxccNegUIjAEQAQ) [😩](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=679517c3ba0a5d08&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifNnotHVfbFCfcH3Diu-3Xm-jzGbPw:1760128566962&amp;q=%F0%9F%98%A9+Weary+Face&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJvvjvvZqQAxUJcGwGHaIDK_sQxccNegUIjAEQAQ) [😩](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=679517c3ba0a5d08&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifNnotHVfbFCfcH3Diu-3Xm-jzGbPw:1760128566962&amp;q=%F0%9F%98%A9+Weary+Face&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiJvvjvvZqQAxUJcGwGHaIDK_sQxccNegUIjAEQAQ) (get the girl sooneeeer pleaseee) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqd13vbxgcuf1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0998d7e3796f05d16f1257216a3df3ec23d47ca\n\nThen when he starts rolling the dough, Jicai gets her apron and puts it on him (**did y'all get the deja vu and get goosebumps all over just like meee?!?**) He looks very aware and very sensitive and very very taken aback that she is so close to him, touching him. He seems to resist his feelings!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0u2dqw29icuf1.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a11c3fd7ed5e8400e42f4377bcab04626d654246\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esoz6ruaicuf1.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dad23eefa40b8d2d24a5f78cf1c37501a691e07\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0qfqrndicuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94e5f24b98dd214f7ab07220b79bfb9670bfc263\n\nJicai luaghs at him for wearing a cute, maiden apron and THAT STEP! That flirtatious expression! LI YUNRUIIIII!!!\n\nI really swooned! Lin Yan lightly strikes on her forehead again for teasing him, but Jicai praises him to be a hero and a man of valor. \n\nShen Jicai feeds him a cake and Lin Yan praises it. Jicai tells him she doesn't really like QIxi because the cowherd tricked the weaver girl just because he liked her, reducing her from any kind of freedom and agency. Lin Yan points out that because most poems are written by men, they would never think like this and realise the problem.  \n  \nJicai vaguely remembers her boyfriend from modern world, how he mocked her for being serious about a drama. Feeling heard, she is impressed by Lin Yan. They prepare the flowercakes together.  \n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tusvkesrjcuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb16bf9e5901668ef73b56a90e6a3d935acff7d4\n\nThese two episodes were really cute and wholesome, our leads are already getting close, and Lin Yan is already very sensitive to Jicai's presence! \n\nAt the banquet, Censorate Pei and Lin Yan sits side by side, praising each other. Lin Yan watches Shen Jicai deliver cakes and mesmerised by the festive scenes, and secretly asks a maid to ask for persmission of the princess for the chef family to attend the banquet as well.  \n  \nLin Yan also asks Shen Jicai to sit beside him and make tea, while the maid returns with the news that since the Princess is very satisfied with the food they made, she'll allw them to enjoy the banquet. The Shen family gets warned by Mother Shen to be at their best behavior and joins a table with Shen Jicai.   \n  \nLater, the nobles are gathering around notable figures and praising to get attention, flocking around Lin Yan as well. While offering tea, Lin Yan cheers to Jicai, which one noble doesn't like and comes to create an issue when Mother Shen accidentally bumps against him.\n\nHowever, Shen Jicai quickly retaliates, saying trying to kick them out from the banquet would mean he is dissatisfied iwth the princess's taste. This impresses the audiencdes and Lin Yan, who again realises she's bold and fearless.  \n  \nThe noble tries to create an issue, but Lin Yan, again, comes and sends him away after threatening him that the princess would soon join. Later, the brother is muttering how it's unfair that people are measured by class, which the owner of the Guixiang Tavern praises him for his statement. Fueled by praises, the brother stands up and farther criticises the high-low ranking system and how men are obsessed with domination and power, instead of giving proper respect as equals. \n\nThis attends the whole banquet's attention and someone counters that the rank must stay otherwise no son would follow the father and no wife would follow the husband. But the brother insists that in marriage, proper respect and mutual understanding is necessary otherwise they would leave if the men are overbearing and domineering. \n\nThe women at the banquet are very impressed and praises him, and the Princess also arrives to praise him, but is disappointed to see his ugly face 😂 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pxjrzt46mcuf1.png?width=1103&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce945df91160467afbb0b2669c1fe525f7331c07\n\nHowever, she does praise him for his unique insights and then doesn't stand on ceremony for long, leaving them be. Later, Lin Yan gives Shen Jicai 5 gold bars, saying the Princess provided them along with several yards of silk as reward. \n\nBut later when the Princess calls her, she finds out that the Princess only gave her some yards of silk , not the gold. Realising they're from Lin Yan, she goes to him to return them, but he refuses to take them, calling it a gratitude for helping him make connection with the Princess.  \n  \nShen Jicai also thanks him for the intervention during the conflict but Lin Yan only praises her for her rebuttal and calls the other party foul for their behaviour (*right right right, your girl is never the one in fault!*) The two stare and smile at each other with starry eyes (*and fluttering hearts, I hope!)*   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gfpi9hhncuf1.png?width=1096&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d03da616814be6b4e9ac6689f539cd8b23e6d902\n\nThey both flirting like it's nobody's business! invites him to a dinner soon and leaves with the gold. His right-hand man, Liu Chang, sees the bag and remarks how he could give away his  salary since entering the service (*myyy, we're giving away assets already!*) \n\nHe also politely reminds Lin Yan if he was going to dissolve the engagement any time soon and this makes all the color and sweetness fade away from his face. \n\nThis ends our episodic discussion for 5 and 6! You can find the first four episode discussion here: [Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o23nk6/yummy_yummy_yummy_%E5%AE%B4%E9%81%87%E6%B0%B8%E5%AE%89_2025_what_are_your_first/) \n\nI'm honestly so impressed with Wang Yinglu. She is the beauty and the brain, although it does bug me a little that the brother and father are protrayed like this - I think the Shen Family could have been smarter and interesting, but the lazy brother and devoted husband-father concept is also not too bad. Are you guys also watching? What are your thoughts? ",

    "content": "I'm finishing up &gt;!Love of Nirvana!&lt; and they decided to kill off the ML (btw, can his death be considered “noble idiocy”), and it got me thinking, what's the point of this? Because it adds realism and emotional depth? \n\nFor me, that's not good enough. The viewers spend their time watching 40+ episodes and more than 40 hours, all for a sad ending. In the above drama, it was excellent, 10/10, but why did he have to die? \n\nI think this is unfair. Yes, life is not always peachy and full of rainbows, but correct me if I'm wrong. Isn't the point of watching TV and listening to music to “escape reality” even if it's for 40+ hours?\n\nI can understand if they're making a drama based on real events or real people. (Perhaps some of these dramas are but because I am not knowledgeable in Chinese history?)\n\nI think that if they want to add realism and depth, they should do so early, midway, later, or with an open ending. Give us a coma for months, missing, unsure if they will wake up. I don't even mind it for 10 episodes, but going in the direction of killing the main character? C'mon!\n\nWhy not go this route?  &gt;!Wonderland of Love, Xu Kai’s character thought Jian Tian’s character was dead!&lt; he gave one of the greatest “refusal to let go/false death” I've ever seen. And what happened? &gt;!She wasn't really dead!&lt; it was beautifully done🤌\n\nAnother example &gt;!LBFAD!&lt; was open-ended, we all know &gt;!he's coming back, based on the moon thing!&lt; and hints at things throughout the show. I can't remember exactly, as I watched it a while ago\n\nAlso, another example &gt;!Who rules the world!&lt; it's known he’s gonna die (also one where I can't remember the full details) but I think he &gt;!sacrificed his life force to save her life!&lt; so the viewers know he's going to die but they didn't do it in the show or to end it, not only that, but I think he had like &gt;!10 years to live?!&lt;\n\nIt just seems like drama sabotage because many people will give low/bad ratings simply because you kill their favorite characters. \n\nI'm open to hearing the arguments for killing off a main character. What are your thoughts? I need to hear a convincing argument.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "\n# Shadow Love 与晋长安 (2025)\n\n[*Shadow Love*](https://mydramalist.com/716245-shadow-love) stars [Song Yi](https://mydramalist.com/people/11631-song-yi) as Li Shuang, the infamous female general of Taijin and [Cheng Lei](https://mydramalist.com/people/68393-cheng-lei) as Duan Ao Deng, the prince of Taijin's enemy, the Yao state. Cheng Lei's character loses his memory in episode one, and as a nameless stray, he is renamed Jin An by Li Shuang after she finds him lost in a field. Oh, also, amnesiac Cheng Lei also saved her life in the process.\n\nThe majority of the drama follows the relationship between Li Shaung and Ji An as they try to fend off the Yao state, which has recently lost its emperor, Duan Ao Ze (portrayed by [Dun Chu](https://mydramalist.com/people/855-du-chun)) - Duan Ao Deng's older brother.\n\n# Ruminations\n\nI enjoyed the drama, but there is no denying that there was an imbalance between the amount of time Cheng Lei's character spent with and without his original memories. Personally, I think episodes 23 - 30 could have been cut, or at least shortened, but I don't regret finishing it.\n\nSong Yi does strong female characters very well, and it was refreshing to see Cheng Lei in a role more dynamic than \"intimidating side-eye\". (Not complaining, I love that side eye).\n\nThere are many interesting places the drama could have gone, and I think instead of deep diving into interesting lore, they ended up making these potentially amazing storylines feel like filler.\n\nThat being said, I don't regret watching it. And I definitely don't regret finishing it since the part where Cheng Lei eventually regains his memories was very intense and enjoyable to watch. (Not a spoiler, obviously, the man was eventually going to regain his memories.)\n\n# The GIFs\n\nAs always, you are all more than welcome to use these GIFs - I make them so that they can be used. There is no need to give credit; however, if you use them for a post, please do mention where the GIFs originate from. \n",

Please do not discuss the plots for episodes beyond that, and if you hint at spoilers please use the spoiler tags. ⚠️\n\n# Episode 21\n\n**The squabble for the new emperor begins!**\n\nIn the fine tradition of CDramas, it's all the emperor's fault.\n\nDid I miss something? I do not understand the emperor at all. You have this terminal illness for 15 years and you did not have a succession plan nor did you secure Suige's position in court as a crown prince? (Note that he isn't the crown prince yet, merely referred to as the \"eldest prince\".)\n\nMy theory is that the emperor was purposely treating his son like an outcast for two reasons: He wants to force Suige to toughen as he really wants him to be the next emperor (like our prime minister guessed). However, due to power of the Zhuangs, he did not want to tip them off by favouring Suige in any way. (Note how the empress gloated when the emperor removed Suige from officiating the wedding of his sister.)\n\nThis included making Suige crown prince. He knew that once he declared Suige as the heir, his life would be at risk. The emperor also probably thought he had time to secure Suige, or maybe the final parts of his plan did not fall in place yet.\n\nOr, he could be truly incompetent in helping his son secure his position lol\n\nI'm leaning on a mix of incompetence and stupidity, how about you?\n\nSo, my theory is that all this is probably the emperor's way of protecting Suige, though I don't think it's a very effective strategy.\n\nBut the Marquis says that the emperor would've made arrangements already. Hmmmmm\n\n**These people just don't deserve Suige**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11h5tq278auf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f11bc17e23ebcb2c9a96e9c5cf6450354e096c4\n\nStill, despite his father's inaction and lack of foresight, Suige appears to be filial and really loves his father, despite their estrangement. Unfortunately, whispers in the court that he is plotting his father's demise.\n\nOh dear, I have a BIG FEELING I know where this is heading.  Suige, I'm already hurting for ya!\n\nI'm still moved by the love between our two brothers. Seriously, 2nd prince, how did you remain so sweet in this den of vipers?\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1o30h59/video/udgu8dtk6auf1/player\n\nAnd I love Suige for being such a good brother, determined to never spill the dark things his mother and grandfather was doing. But alas, like their sister Xiyang, our 2nd prince is far too innocent and even if he is made emperor by his scary grandfather he will be a mere puppet, with no ruthless streak to ensure that he has the upper hand. What a sad fate!\n\n**Don't cry for me, Jinxiu**\n\nWe continue to see what a miserable life Jingshi has (and had) in Jinxiu. I'm so sad.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1or5n0l07auf1.gif\n\nYeah, no.\n\nI have a problem with death camp owning, fake nice, pawn discarding people.\n\nXiyang, meanwhile, tries to cope with her new lot in life in the most positive way she can, saying that she wishes that she and Jingshi will have a beautiful life together. Jingshi pours cold water on that fantasy (well, I have to admire him for his honesty). I don't know what romance novels you read, lady, but I want a Goodreads recommendation from ya.\n\nAlso, did you notice when Xiyang gets sad, the song that plays has these lyrics: \"Don't cry, I'll remember the way home\"?\n\nWell, that's not fair, show, trying to make me cry for like that .\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jnw0ir487auf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd8e3c40fdc4ce10a4b596949d32dea4a60f116e\n\nTo the producers' credit, I'm a smidge sad for Xiyang, just a *smidge*.\n\nBy the way, I don't hate her, I'm just excessively annoyed by her naivete and lack of foresight. Who do you think she got *that* from?\n\nAlso, is it me or do I see tiny glimmers of warmth from Jingshi for Xiyang? And frankly, it doesn't feel comforting at all. And I don't think he appreciates her attempts at defending him as it humiliates him further.\n\nThis weird love triangle they're hinting at between Jingshi, Xiyang and the emperor? I wonder if Jingshi will eventually feel hideous jealousy as his brother the emperor starts flirting with his wife?Love? Nah, it's not love, it's the fact that the emperor is trying to take Xiyang and is humiliating him in the biggest way possible. (It'll be in his character to treat Xiyang like some kind of possession instead of an actual person, even if he doesn't appreciate said possession.)\n\nInstead of making me pity Jingshi I'm feeling even **more annoyed** with him. Then again, I'm even more annoyed with the emperor. At this moment I'm rootin' for Jingshi to run him through with a sword just for giggles.\n\n**All the plotters are a'plottin'**\n\nFinally, the Prime Minister's motives come clearly to light. He wants the emperor to beg for his son's life  and bury him - this is probably because the emperor caused his son's death? (Did I miss something)\n\n[My boss lady taking to kidnapping like she been doing it since birth. It's true love when you kidnap and maim bad guys for your man.](https://preview.redd.it/mkeuomll9auf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccbedea32df9a00f08e135296e702fcd76e1f096)\n\nMurong Yao's dad is at least more honourable than his deceitful son, sigh. Well, dad, it's not going to be pleasant when you find out the truth.\n\n**The empress' sad life (who cares?)**\n\nMeanwhile, we see the Empress' memory of being a not-favoured concubine. Looks like she did love the Emperor. Ah, the classic \"I'm jealous the Empress is the favoured one, so let's destroy her so I can take her place\" plot. She must've thought she would eventually gain the emperor's love this way by being the replacement. However, the emperor hiding his illness from her told her that he didn't trust her at all, and that he never intended to make their son the emperor.\n\n# Episode 22\n\nSo the empress is delulu in her own way. She ends up almost killing the emperor in a fit of rage. I bet your dad's gonna be thrilled, dearie. You would've robbed him of a satisfying revenge, not to mention your timing is a little inconvenient.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e0lqa3kh9auf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23168fdae8ca086cfcb66e38b89f12a8d206ec21\n\nThat memory of him slapping the dumplings from her hands and look of pure disgust. Here's my theory: He knew that the first empress was framed by the Zhuangs, and he knew that *she* was involved. So, our emperor was pretending to hate the former empress to throw the Zhuangs off the scent. 15 years is sure a long time to play house with the murderer of your beloved. Not sure if I should admire him or despise him for not seeking justice for his wife like Suige had begged.\n\nI want this empress to, like, go now.\n\nHonestly, I like how complex the villainous characters are written. I think she was genuinely a good mother to Xiyang and the second prince. But in her delulu way she thought that she could just step in to the former empress' life and live her dream life. The emperor put up a good show for 15 years!\n\n**Is the second prince finally folding??**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxpfwt4n7auf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e92904f82cb827bb585d544201029683f007faa8\n\nAnd alas, the second prince is getting corrupted! He seemed semi-convinced of the empress'  tale of how Suige will end up killing them once he ascends so he must kill him first. Alas! Don't be stupid, kid! If only you knew how much your brother loves you.\n\nWhen his grandfather tells him to be an emperor, he shakily says yes.\n\nUgh. I hate the Zhuangs.\n\nSecond prince, don't betray Suige too (sobs).\n\n(Why do I feel that sad end is coming for the second prince?)\n\n**Suige is still in the dark**\n\nA part of me is so frustrated that Yixiao took so long to tell Suige, but I understand why Yixiao hesitated.\n\nYixiao took her time to investigate thoroughly before giving Suige the information because she didn't want any doubts at all when she told him the truth.\n\nBecause, well, she could lose Suige if there was even a tiny bit of doubt. How would it look to Suige if she tried to turn him against his best friend, she being a former general of Jinxiu? On top of that, she knew it would be a terrible blow for Suige. So, when she told him the truth, there was a genuine worry that he'd not believe her and she would lose his trust.\n\nBut I love how efficient and business-like our girl is in torturing, kidnapping and beating up people to help her beau with his problems. True love, y'all!\n\nAnyway, Suige took it well.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/781hpnrr7auf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=388a59ee1262fa6cce1001b3fd640b5beadaaa66\n\nYeah, NO, Suige is NOT fine.  In fact, Suige has lost all logic. I was like literally, dude, no, not now! Aren't you losing the advantage of surprise? I don't know, shouldn't you plan something to counter them?\n\nBut my poor prince, he looks shattered and he's probably not thinking straight and it's his bestie!\n\nI almost wished that Yixiao had knocked him out  to stop him.\n\nAnyway, we get this fantastic scene between these two former best friends where Murong Yao finally shared his great bitterness over being a vassal to the Feng family.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/07xhc8dy7auf1.jpg?width=2712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de13601e08d025fac25762d9b931768ec14f3277\n\nWas Murong Yao ever considered Suige as a friend, or was he pretending all these years?\n\nAnd why did he goad Suige to kill him? Was he actually feeling guilty, trying to 'atone'? Or did he do it just to get his father freed?\n\nPoor Suige, he kept having people betray him.\n\n# Previews for episodes 23-24 \n\nEveryone &gt;!has lost their goddamn minds.!&lt;\n\n# Some details I noticed \n\n* In this universe, the moon will suddenly shine super brightly behind our couple. The Moon Goddess is truly blessing our couple. It's a good sign!\n* The wind mysteriously appears at the most badass moment. I stan the wind machine. But I'm dissapointed with the lack of flower petals.\n\n# Questions to ponder\n\n1. What do you think is Murong Yao's true reasons for mutiny?\n\n2. Did you think Murong Yao considered Suige a friend at all or was he just pretending?\n\n3.What do you think of the emperor's plans?\n\n4. Did you think it was a bad move for Suige to confront Murong Yao the way he did?\n\n5. Is your heart softening towards Jingshi? ",

Fantastic advice, but allow me to drop a brief pitch.\n\n**Why you should watch**\n\n• no filler, no prolonged scenes, no BS. If the \"skip cutscene\" sentiment was embodied in the Cdrama world, it would look like this. The whole story is done and dusted in roughly the length of two longer blockbuster movies, and it makes use of every minute\n\n• all the quality of a full-length drama (music, voice acting, costumes, and sets). They did not skimp!\n\n• S T E A M Y chemistry, like off the charts. Racier than many series dare to be as well 👀\n\n• First drama I've seen possibly ever where a crossdressing woman could pass for a man. Still incredibly petite and I'd still have to squint just right, but it's actually believable that people are fooled by her. The actress has also got the body language and demeanor of someone socialized as a man, and the voice actor has the voice just right as well\n\n**Why you shouldn't**\n\n• If you're looking for &gt;!a 100% happy ending!&lt;, this isn't it.\n\n• yes, that's literally all the fault I found in it\n\nAre you in? You can watch either the [compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFZPtGMtBLw&amp;list=PLPHFQiE-MdaKwr_6XnmYoHc8F91oWNZVI&amp;index=4) on YouTube or individual episodes from there or your preferred platform.

Please have a read through of the post below and feel free to ask any questions!\n\nSo, as you know, me and a couple of other users run the [r/CDrama](/r/CDrama/) Awards every year and there are always some complaints about how dramas that are seen in the second half of the year are more likely to be nominated, vs the ones in the beginning of the year.\n\nTo combat that, I created a Google Sheets document for you guys to use to record your faves from month to month, quarter to quarter. This will also help streamline the nominations process.\n\nSo here is how you use it:\n\nI have the document set on viewer mode for everyone. If you want to use this document to record your faves, please follow the instructions below.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Open the link --&gt; the document will open and you will notice that you can see it but cannot edit.\n2. Go to File --&gt; Make a Copy --&gt; Rename as you wish --&gt; press enter ( You should now have a google sheets that you can edit)\n\n**If you don't want to use google sheets**, you can use the same steps but instead of selecting \"Make a copy\" you would select \"Download\" and select the form you would want it in.\n\nLink: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MGJa0uUtzRp7dJD1IGxzb5S-NZUkgfXeCgYCFo3eRyo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MGJa0uUtzRp7dJD1IGxzb5S-NZUkgfXeCgYCFo3eRyo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIf you have any questions please let me know.

His uncle, Wu San Xing, discovers an enigmatic map hidden within it. To find the missing owner of the manuscript, Wu San Xing forms an expedition with Wu Xie, Pan Zi, Zhang Qi Ling, and Da Kui. They venture into the location marked on the map. During their quest, Wu Xie meets Wang Pang Zi, another explorer. Facing life-threatening challenges and attacks by mysterious creatures, the team relies on teamwork, wit, and courage to survive.\n\n[Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/s/6ktOJJkXzy)\n\nTime Raiders is a modern adventure and tomb-raiding drama.  It is part of **The Lost Tomb/Daomu Biji** series but Wu Xie's Private Notes, or **Time Raiders (2025)** is a perfect place to start as it goes back to the beginning. As someone who has had no contact with the original books, nor the previous adaption, i had no problems following along the story.  This [tumblr post](https://www.tumblr.com/foxofninetales/796586011189805056/daomu-bijithe-lost-tombtime-raiders-strict?source=share) is a perfect guide to the series, if you want to have a look. The drama, or series may appeal to **fans of of Lara Croft, Jumanji, The mummy, or Indiana Jones**\n\nWhen it  comes to adventure dramas, all I really ask is to have enjoy myself and to experience the thrill and danger of an adventure. And for me, Time Raiders easily delivered, kept me engaged and added a sprinkle of mystery. The drama was addictive, and that makes me question how most people suffered through the dramas an episode a day airing schedule. The characters are well-written, or more importantly felt normal and human, which contributed to their team dynamics.\n\nIt does suffer from the expositional dialogue that most fantasy or period cdramas have, but its easy to understand and serves as background knowledge. The fantasy elements of the drama were fascinating yet familiar, and the cgi and 'tomb-building' was excellent. *(People's opinion on this is subjective and often polarizing- i liked it and found it realistic for the most part, chances are high that there's someone who disagrees with me.)*  The drama is fast-paced, but there is a dip in the pacing of the drama in the middle, as they end an adventure and prepare for the next, which is expected and usually important for plot-reasons.\n\nThe characters are also well-written, or more importantly felt normal and human, which contributed to their team dynamics. It was easy to care for them and enjoy their interactions.\n\n[i apologise for the terrible cut, but i really wanted to use this gif, Wu Xie and Pangzi fist-bumb](https://i.redd.it/b42rqhfrmauf1.gif)\n\nThe drama can be broken down into two arcs, and while they effortlessly lead to the other, our main excavation team differs. The \"Iron Triangle\" get to stand on their own and grown on each other (and me) mostly in the second arc, while we see their foundational interactions and introductions in the first arc.  In my opinion, this makes it a much more enjoyable experience. The drama ends by finishing the current adventure, answering the relevent questions, and by giving us hints that there's more to come.\n\nthis was my first modern adventure cdrama, so I will definitely be checking out others, like *Parallel  World.*\n\n[the main character, Wu Xie](https://i.redd.it/u4wgayngnauf1.gif)\n\n[the mysterious Xiaoge ](https://i.redd.it/fmhtsldtnauf1.gif)",

So you’ve been warned.\n\nLinks to Discussions:  [Masterpost ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o11y5s/love_in_the_clouds_%E5%85%A5%E9%9D%92%E4%BA%91_2025_what_are_your_first/)\n\n# The Premise\n\nIt‘s a tale as old as time - countries fighting over valuable resources.  So to eliminate further bloodshed, the emperors from the six realms signed an agreement over a millennia ago to start the Qingyun tournament. Each realm will send out warriors to compete in the tournament and the realm that emerge as the victor will get to enjoy the beneficence of the Blessed Rain for a year, after which they get to repeat the whole song-and-dance again.\n\nOver the last seven years, victory has belonged to Yaoguan Mountain, whose crowned prince Ming Xian seems poised for an eight consecutive win until a former felon named Jin Bozai from Jixing Abyss arrives to best him. Almost overnight, the once-feted MVP falls from the clouds into the mud and is forced to flee from Yaoguan Mountain. Ming Xian also discovers that the reason he lost to Jin Bozai is because he has contracted a poison called Heavenly Grief.  To save his life, he will need to find a herb/antidote called the Golden Millet Dream and he will need to do within a year, before the last petal from the Grief Blossom mark on his wrist falls.\n\n[I find the beginning fight sequence quite bad-ass. And the Hunger Games style live-cast is quite cool. ](https://preview.redd.it/jsm8bowpl7uf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a41e3fa3080a32a8aab7f785c1b24d2d18fb4d1)\n\n# Meet Mr. and Mrs. Smith\n\nExcept that Ming Xian is not a he but a she - she has been using magic to disguise herself as a man. So what is a girl to do but get a job as a dancer at Moonlit Blossom, a pleasure house Jin Bozai frequents, so that she can seduce him into taking her home with him? The Heavenly Grief destroys the spiritual veins of those who already have them, but grows spiritual veins for those who don’t already have them. Since Jin Bozai wasn’t born with spiritual veins, Ming Xian - now called Ming Yi - figures that he’s probably ingested Heavenly Grief himself, which means that he’s also in possession of the Golden Millet Dream.\n\nWhat follows is a game of wits between two people who don’t trust each other but are forced to put on the act of a loving couple. Ming Yi wants to find the Golden Millet Dream, and Bozai wants to use Ming Yi as an excuse not to accept the female spies Mu Qibai, brother to the emperor of the Jixing Abyss, keeps on trying to install in his household. The pros of this arrangement? We get treated to some romantic and seemingly steamy visuals all within the first 3 episodes of the drama. The cons? I say “seemingly steamy” because I didn’t feel much heat from the encounters since no genuine emotion is involved. But these two sure are pretty.\n\n[We get an almost-kiss, two people undressing each other in bed, the FL studying a dual cultivation manual, and a body frisk…all within he first 3 episodes. ](https://preview.redd.it/42bx78dkl7uf1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=614028e5b2017e2b3c0b04ad762045565978e01d)\n\n# Bozai’s Revenge\n\nSo how did Ji Bozai rise from a prisoner in the Sunken Abyss to a national hero and what is his end game?  It turns out that he offered his services to Princess Tianjin in return for clearing his name.  But his real purpose is to find out who killed his master Bo Yulan so he can avenge his master’s death.  Bo Yulan comes from a prominent family of physicians who cultivated both the Heavenly Grief and the Golden Millet Dream. By blackmailing Hou Zhao, former chief to the Justice Hall, Bozai finds out that Mu Qibai and Hou Zhao inadvertently killed Bo Yulan when trying to force her to disclose the location of the Golden Millet Dream’s formula.\n\n[I need more “earthy” Hou Ming Hao in peasant garb.  Also hope to see more of his back story. ](https://preview.redd.it/a6axg95jm7uf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=344e484b2c129b9bcb5e4d5c4eb367caf53b8963)\n\n[The Soul-Seizing Technique is supposed to make Bo Yulan dislocate the Golden Millet Dream’s location but ended up killing her. ](https://preview.redd.it/4ocemzcwl7uf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08dadea1395b521f65d16dc66d69db8cbccd4d87)\n\n# The Marriage Scheme\n\nMing Yi finds Bozai’s spiritual well, where she thinks he has hidden the Golden Millet Dream (My ears immediately perked up upon hearing the words “spiritual well”.  Those of you who have seen **When Destiny Brings the Demon** knows why…). Since the only way to gain access to Bozai’s spiritual well is to share his divine consciousness, and married couples can freely share each other’s consciousness, the solution seems simple, at least to Ming Yi.  She must get Bozai to marry her!\n\nTowards that purpose, she decides to help Bozai steal Bo Yulan’s portrait from the Hall of Justice. It just so happens that Bozai had the same idea. So the two ends up breaking into the Hall of Justice together.  Even though they do manage to steal the painting, Ming Yi also gets herself shot by the Soul-Devouring Arrow in the process which leads to more of our favorite romantic tropes - Bozai healing Ming Yi with his spiritual energy and taking her out to dinner at the market.  And he even remembered that her favorite food is scallion pancakes!  Aw…\n\n[Ming Yi is touched that Bozai remembered her farvorite food…](https://preview.redd.it/qyp8i9dfn7uf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaf7e1128475bcf165ad638bb9646748cd2ae77d)\n\n[But then she goes into her manipulation mode again…](https://preview.redd.it/jyqxyfdjn7uf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c763dfe1d1f1a4fcd4b8e3a0ccf9ed5ea0219d15)\n\nAnd that leads to my biggest gripe with this drama so far.  Instead of letting any genuine attraction and emotion develop, everything is played for laughs. I mean, I can overlook the shift to a more comedic tone after the seriousness of the QIngyun tournament, but Ming Yi’s shift from a warrior to a more girlish persona gives me whiplash.  She seems smart and adept at psychological warfare one minute - pretending to be a thief to distract Bozai from her real purposes for coming to Wugui Sea, deliberately getting shot by the soul-devouring arrow to make her him feel indebted to her. The next she is displaying the emotional maturity of a doorknob and don’t seem to understand the ramifications of her actions when it comes to the opposite sex.  She reads the dual cultivation manual and tries to copy it but her heart doesn’t beat any faster. She seems touched by the fact that Bozai remembered her favorite food but goes into her manipulation mood before she’s even had time to swallow the said pancake. She just seems a bit…empty right now. And as someone who believes the Bozai poisoned her, she also doesn’t seem to exhibit the proper amount of animosity or hate or any kind of emotion whatsoever…\n\n# The Real Potential Lovers-To-Enemies-To-Lovers Again\n\nplotline belongs to Princess Tianji and Yan Xiao, the physician immortal. We find out that Yan Xiao used to be the princess’ guard but defected to Mu Qibai’s side after studying to become a physician because Mu Qibai’s has more to offer him in terms of upward mobility.  So now the childhood sweethearts are now at odds with each other even though he clearly still harbors some feelings for her. For the princess’ part, she seems to have moved on and is now on a quest to get Bozai to marry her.  I can’t quite decide if she really likes Bozai or only wants to marry him because he will be a good ally for her. But if the drama keeps going on the trajectory it is on now, I may very well end up being more invested in this pairing. And it is definitely NOT because Yan Xiao is played on Quan Yi Lun….\n\n[Is a reconciliation in store for these two? ](https://preview.redd.it/mpcw3546l7uf1.jpg?width=2732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0ad20e938ab238f61a0710674c51ffad510f20e)\n\n# So There You Have it.\n\nWhat did you think of the drama so far?  Personally, I am hoping that the writers tone down the comedy a bit and hope that they make some progress on the romance soon. Is this one of those stories where the ML falls first, gets his heart broken by the FL, and then the FL will need to work overtime to win him back?  I hope so because right now, she is being just a tad too manipulative for my liking.  And for those of you who have read the novel, no spoilers!\n\n# ",

It's not like I'm not getting the jokes, I do understand them but I don't find them funny at all. On the contrary, jokes that don't hit makes this drama less appealing for me because a I love to have a good laugh once in a while while watching my dramas. I will say the sets and outfits are gorgeous though so if you like pretty people and pretty things maybe they'll compensate for the niché humour. This drama seems to have a lot of fan service moments which, to *me*   , is a little cringe. Like I don't mind fan service dramas, I'm obsessed with TTEOTM, but this one seems too obvious with their fan service and also a little weird. What do you think though? ",

    "title": "Reminder: Why \"Melons\" 🍉 or gossip and rumours belong to the Yumcha thread on Tuesdays. (Also, how to differentiate between real news and rumours!)",
    "content": "Hello all,\n\nAs we have new members in our community all the time, I thought it'll be a good idea to periodically remind and educate everyone about what's real / fake news in the Chinese entertainment scene.\n\nFirst, here's a really useful article written by u/Technical-Abroad8918 \\-  [Melon Accounts 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/13ox2q7/melon_accounts_101/). \n\nAlso, [Can someone pls explain the word “YXH” and how bad it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/17isrlr/can_someone_pls_explain_the_word_yxh_and_how_bad/)? \n\nDue to the language barrier, a lot of international CDrama fans have come to rely on CDrama \"news\" from Twitter or blogs. FYI, a lot of them source their news from \"marketing accounts\" (or yxh) in China that do not do any due diligence in fact checking, often spread unverified news or spin false news. \n\nSome of the news are explosive and sensational enough to cause anxiety among fans, actors and productions. Actors' careers have been destroyed by them.\n\nTax evasion news, for example. Affairs. Casting is another favourite because fans of Actor A gets upset if their idol is paired with Actor B and the Internet melts down.\n\nWhen I came back to watching CDramas, I was also fooled by these \"news\", so I don't blame anyone for falling for them.\n\n# Real news vs melons 🍉\n\nMy advice on how to identify real news is REALLY boring. If you want to get real news about Chinese dramas, whether it be casting news, airing dates etc, rely on these sources:\n\n* Production companies\n* The actor's \"studio\"\n* Platforms like Youku, iQIYI, Tencent etc\n* Official media like People's Daily, Xinhua, Global Times, China Daily, South China Morning Post (please ignore the entertainment rags, they're often unreliable)\n* The Chinese government, especially about taxes and other legal matters. Recently, China's Actors Committee of China Federation of Radio and Television Association (CFRTA) [announced](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202501/1326450.shtml) that \"tax-related matters should be based on the official announcements of the relevant national tax authorities\". So, if a random Weibo account or paparazzi announces an actor has tax issues, WAIT for the government to make an announcement to confirm that news.\n\nRecently, I came across a Weibo post that said: \"Weibo is a toilet, and if you're reading this, you're eating my s%!t\". This made me laugh out loud because no truer words have been written!\n\nMelons can cause unnecessary anxiety and stress for fans ... and celebrities themselves. \n\nBut they are also fun, and we understand the desire to talk about them, which is why we have the [Yumcha Thread every Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/search/?q=%22%F0%9F%8D%B5+Yumcha+Tea+Time+Tuesdays%22&amp;cId=c725896e-b395-477e-8ee7-06ee2d6d7cbb&amp;iId=360c550c-e236-4579-a16c-6f765d5d8dfd&amp;sort=new). There's an understanding that everything written in the Yumcha Thread is unverified and most probably untrue. We funnel unverified news to this thread and discourage rumours as individual posts because we don't want them to be mistaken as real news and to prevent unnecessary alarm.\n\nWhile it's fun to read melons, always be aware that being gossiped about is not a fun experience for anyone, even celebrities, so let's practice kindness and have a healthy dose of skepticism about them. :)\n\nThanks!\n\nPS: This message will be periodically published as a reminder.",

As a person who just wants to stay in a fantasy world, this drama hit me hard with the ending. I don’t know if it’s a happy ending or not because the ML, of course, doesn’t remember anything, and how would they even be together when it’s like office and real world, and the real world is so harsh and reality doesn’t fill any fantasy. The whole illusion that this isn’t reality but was just a dream and fantasy is so true that it’s troubling me. I feel like I can’t really describe this feeling of emptiness and sadness, and I don’t know if anyone can relate to that or not, but I feel like I am also back to reality.

Meng Junran (the Masked Man) is Murong Yao &amp; Yixiao knows that info!  Suige knows that Meng Junran is in charge of the death camp warriors now that Weiran and Jingshi have left the capital.  It will be a huge betrayal when Suige finds out Meng Junran is his BF.\n2. Murong Yao isn't working alone. He is part of a group.  It will be interesting to find out who is in this group in Susha.\n3. The Emperor is terminally ill.  And he’s had this illness for 15 years. \n4. The secret group in the forest that is healing Ning Fei is called Storm Alliance and Suige’s mother founded the group. \n\n**Themes from today's episodes**\n\n**A)** An overarching for this show: The theme of women being saved by men. Being loyal to those men. And then those men using them as pawns / being willing for the women to die to protect their great cause.\n\nI wondered why we were getting so much of Miss Ruyan in Ep 19 &amp; 20.  Then Yixiao said she sees herself in Miss Ruyan and I realized there's an overaching theme for the show writer(s).\n\nThe theme of being saved, devoted, and discarded is true for Yixiao and Miss Ruyan. Xiyang is in this same category but her end fate is still TBD. I hope Miss Ruyan and Xiyang will follow Yixiao's lead and live for themselves.\n\n**B)** Our leads are very hot when being fierce.\n\n[Yixiao loves to be in control :\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ibtvldtpm4uf1.jpg?width=918&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0b88e2174d54a0087099a42e878bc7556e53ee8)\n\n[Suige looks like he's getting turned on by hurting the Death Camp Chief who tortured his love as a child. ](https://preview.redd.it/x5edi83um4uf1.jpg?width=918&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7366b72cfab7e3cc8097cca7b59825378a88dd44)\n\n**C)** Both leads used trackers in these episodes.

The token allows him to connect with the death camp leader.\n* Doc Ling sends Suige a prescription.  Is this a prescription or a secret message?\n* Suige decides benevolently to Xiyang to send her servants with her dowry so she won't be as lonely.\n   * Will Xiyang’s servant who has been spying for the Empress feel happy to be shipped off to Jinxiu?\n* Xiyang and Jingshi- Xiyang is still starring as the lead in the romance novel she wrote. (Shout out to [u/kichererbs](https://www.reddit.com/user/kichererbs/) for naming this in their comment yesterday).\n   * She thinks Jingshi must be thinking of fond childhood memories.\n   * Jingshi is thinking about how he was beaten up by his brother the Emperor.\n   * We learn that Jingshi’s mother is a maid. I was guessing a concubine but we learn it’s a maid.\n   * I guess Jingyan really takes after his father in the playboy role.\n* Oh how I wanted to wipe the smirk off of Muroung’s face in his confrontation with Yixiao.\n* We had a long time for the reveal of Murong Yao as Meng Junran.  Therefore, I knew he wouldn’t be taken down easily.  But I don’t know what to think of his comments that he intends to spare Suige. We didn’t get any more about his overall plan. Though we did learn he is part of a group not a lone wolf.  His group could kill the emperor at any time. \n* I hope Yixiao doesn’t sit on this info for too long. Suige needs to know ASAP in a clandestine manner to be aware that his BF is plotting something. \n* Doc Xueying’s return to the villa will allow her to treat the minister of war. \n* We learn the Minister of War is the only minister on Suige's side in court. I note this because I've been wondering for a while why it seems like no one in court is on his side.  I would think he would have his own faction of ministers.  I guess it's just one.\n* Multiple groups like poisoned arrows. The backup to the guy Empress Zhuang sent to kill Yixiao had poisoned arrows that shot Ning Fei. And now these death camp warriors have poison arrows. \n   * It almost seems like Yixiao is the only one without poison in her arrow tips. \n\n**Ep 20:**\n\n* We continue the trend of love goggles blinding us from the truth and making someone delulu. Yesterday it was Xiyang. Today it was Miss Ruyan. Despite knowing her lover sent people to kill her, she still stumbles towards Murong mansion.\n* Xiyang might be realizing her life in Jinxiu might not be the fun adventure she had in her imagination for her romance novel.  She started to figure that out before she learned she be living in the prior Eunuch hospice care facility.\n* Any bets on how soon it will be before her new brother in law tries to seduce her? I'm hoping the Jinxiu Emperor tries to seduce and doesn't just jump to trying to rape her.  Sad that I think that. But it's a theme in too many shows to not know it's a possibility.\n* Murong Yao asks Suige to be in charge of the Imperial guards for a couple of days so he can rest.  I think this is a trap for Suige.\n* Yesterday I said the ministers only had one track ***blame the First Prince***.\n* Today I think Feng Suige might have his own one track ***Did Prime Minister Zhuang put you up to this?***\n   * I hope Suige widens his thinking moving forward.\n\n**Prime Minister Zhuang Musings:**\n\nReminder in Ep 1, PM Zhuang says his son died and that's why he wants revenge.  I forgot about this.  Others in yesterday's discussion also didn't remember the son.\n\nI'm assuming the son was a similar age to the Emperor or just a bit younger.  We haven't gotten any details on how the son died.  I am thinking it might have been in a battle, but I don't know if the show hinted at that.  I assume the Prime Minister thought the Emperor (and maybe the first Empress) were responsible for the death of his only son.  I mention this because this detail must come back onto play soon.\n\nI can't tell if PM Zhuang and Murong Yao are working together. Or are there two different groups working on schemes in the capital?  I'm not convinced that these two must be working together.  PM Zhuang doesn't seem like the kind of person who would treat Murong Yao as his equal.  And Murong Yao doesn't strike me as someone who would be subservient to PM Zhuang.  I can't wait to read your theories.\n\n**Final Visuals of the day:**\n\n[I love the embroidery details on Yixiao's outfit ](https://preview.redd.it/sjfwp3k9s4uf1.jpg?width=2688&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6a86dc8b4d12b96bb41a630c2768ffb5411b12d)\n\n[While you are self soothing in a rocking chair, I hope you have your own emotional support animal which living or plush. And hopefully yours is way cuter than this figurine :\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/3zi73yocs4uf1.png?width=2532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c473bb65de429ad8eb59850e7240363b683d021)\n\nTomorrow for Ep 21-22, you will have a different host for the day!  It's been a pleasure hosting the discussions yesterday and today.  I'll see you all in the comments :)\n\nAs [u/AirRealistic1112](https://www.reddit.com/user/AirRealistic1112/), who started us off with these great discussions, likes to say... **Over to you** ....",

Discussions about the acting industry, including how actors work, industry trends, and the filmmaking process, are **encouraged**. Feel free to share insights into acting techniques, career paths, and the business side of entertainment.\n\n2.  You may post about actors' roles in films or television, their contributions to the industry, and their professional achievements. Please ensure that the focus remains on their work rather than their personal lives. \n\n3. Maintain a respectful tone in all discussions. Critiques should be constructive and focused on professional aspects and acting techniques rather than personal attacks on an actors' looks, rumours etc. It is fine to critique an actor's performance, but not ok to be derogatory about them.\n\n**What's not OK**\n\n1. Comparing actors' popularity like it's some kind of race to the top.  \n\n2. Treating melon (rumours) like facts, so let's avoid accusing actors of this or that based on unverified melons.\n\n3. Being mean, rude and nasty during discussions. \n\n4. Calling the actors or other celebrities mean names or talk about them in a derogatory way. BTW, critiquing an actor's performance (it's bad/good) is fine.",

    "title": "Love me Love my voice and it’s flawless characters",
    "content": "I had watched love me love my voice when it first came out but I didn’t finish it, I couldn’t remember why.\n\nHowever, I recently watched Under the Skin and loved Tan Jianci so I decided to watch some of the dramas.\n\nLove me love my voice has a unique perspective on voice actors. A lot of the things I love about shows/movies in general are the way actors deliver their lines so it was nice to see a drama about voice actors.\n\nI liked that it is a fluffy drama, not high stakes and I did go into it expecting that. I like that there really wasn’t a “chase”, the ML and FL  liked eo and started dating, then their relationship progressed from there.\n\nWith that being said, I had a gripe with the writing of the characters. First, the life maturity gap between the two leads was too obvious. He was a doctor working and she was…a college student. To be fair, I don’t think their age gap is astronomical, but there is a huge difference between their life experience which unfortunately bled into their relationship. Watching the scenes of him leaving his “job” to drive her to classes, and sometimes sit in on her classes got a chuckle out of me, like that’s so dating an older man started pack classic.\n\nmy problem was I couldn’t finish it the second time around. The male lead had no flaws, the characters in general had no flaws so there was barely any source of conflict which was very unrealistic.\n\nWe had a MQC that was a successful voice actor, a surgeon, an outpatient doctor in an hospital in two locations, a food connoisseur, a great friend and an even greater boyfriend. Even though he was supposed to come across as a complex character with all these attributes, he felt very one dimensional. \nI got bored watching the same scenes play out over and over, no climax, no conflict just smooth sailing. Even sitcoms have conflicts. And when I say “conflict”, I don’t mean a fight, I mean some hurdle or something that showcases a character’s growth. The lack of these made it a hard watch.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that I liked that the two leads started dating as soon as they liked each other and we see them slowly get closer the more their relationship progresses. This is where I would have loved to see some oomph. We had two people that barely knew anything about the other before they started dating, I would have loved to see them handling their differences in personalities and expectations, dating styles etc but we really didn’t get that. Which brings me to my other point of the maturity gap between both leads.\n\nAlthough we hear that the MQC had never dated before, which could be plausible depending on how you think about it (he had like med school and was doing the voice acting thing) and the FL that was her first relationship too, it didn’t feel like one. They didn’t portray that feeling to me in the sense that everything just came together. I also think it’s an extra thing in the writing to kinda justify the “age gap”. Like what if we made him have no dating experience, then it wouldn’t matter that he’s more experienced in every other aspect of life lol. \n\nLast thing about their relationship, although MQC never deliberately did this, he ends up treating Sheng Sheng like she’s his apprentice. Their relationship, although very sweet, came across like teacher and student/idol and fan type relationship to me, although that is a result of the circumstances of how they met. \n\nFinally, these are not points that only apply to the leads, in general, the drama kinda had no climax for me, no deciding points in the storytelling. The writer took a lukewarm temperature and stuck with that same temp throughout the entire show. Most of the characters came across as one dimensional to me. Most of them were just perfect or close to perfect. \n\nOverall, it was a very sweet drama. These thoughts just came to my head as I was going through my “continue watching” list on viki and was introspecting about why I never actually finished it TWICE. This is not hate on the drama, very cute actors, beautiful people throughout the drama, it just lacks character for me.\n\n",

    "title": "The Glory is so different from what I expected",
    "content": "Just finished watching the Glory Chen Duling and Xin Yunlai and I have so much to say. \n\nThis drama has SO MANY FREAKING PLOT HOLES that if a road was made with the script government would've fined, confined and jailed the person who made it. The story itself is enjoyable of you shut of your brain to watch it but sometimes the the story feels like a drunk after thought. BUT there are some things I enjoyed!\n\n\n-----------------\n\n\n**Positives**\n\nA. I LOVED the actress who played fl's mother!!! If this drama was American she would've most certainly gotten an Emmy's nomination if not an award! I think most female actresses in this drama did a great job acting. \n\nB. The outfits are gorgeous!!!!\n\nC. We don't have any weird camera angles!\n\nD. The dynamic between the fl and the ml lead! This couple reminded me of Jiang Li and Duke Su from the Double and even though their chemistry wasn't as strong and fiery I still enjoyed it\n\nE. The plot was ok(?). It was definitely enjoyable but some of the plot holes drove me mad\n\n\n----------------\n\n**Negatives**\n\nA. Plot holes- this drama has so many plot holes that I can write a 600 page book with them.\n\nB. Acting for most part was done well but there is a certain actor who does not know how to give expressions. That one actor ruined quite a few scenes for me\n\nC. It's my personal preference but I kinda wish they kept the fl's best friend (assasin) throughout the story. Her departure didn't make any sense \n\nD. The women helping other women plot could've been done wayyyyy better. They way that plot unfolded seemed was way to unrealistic and pulled me out of the story\n\nE. The way the dad was punished wasn't satisfactory at all. It was honestly hilarious that they decided to end his fate like that. He deserved a proper punishment rather than that. \n\n\n----------\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOverall, I give this drama a 7.5/10 with a rewatch value of 7/10. This is a fun story if you don't have anything else to watch or want to pass time with a decent drama. ",

I can't wait to read what you all enjoyed and see your snaps and gifs!  Let's keep the fun discussions going.\n\n**Episode 17 Observations**\n\n**Main couple:**\n\n* Fire embers street scene - I found this to be unique. And I loved the warm yellow white color grade\n* Meat date\n* Yixiao so matter of fact about her bringing home smitten soldiers whose lives she saved to tutor the kids.\n\n[I loved these warm lit lanterns](https://preview.redd.it/odin8vf4bxtf1.jpg?width=2688&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e946d5c0a3234aeb8011b874dc0f5a4d8d20822a)\n\n[We get to see Yixiao happy.  She deserves it!  And a side embrance with a hand hold.](https://preview.redd.it/vl33ypc7bxtf1.jpg?width=918&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=142a06e18fb793ee7fc507ead655ee8826f05061)\n\n**My Xiyang Aside:**\n\n* Man handling your husband on your wedding night, that's a choice.\n* Treason? Is taking your father's token treason?\n\nFor context, I wrote this next part when Yixiao was practicing her archery in Wutong Mansion and realized Feng Suige might be in danger.  I paused the show and wrote this. I didn't edit it after seeing how the episode unfolded.\n\n* Xiyang - do like your wedding gift? Did it live up to your dreams?\n   * No gift better tells you this man will never love you — than him trying to kill your beloved brother as your wedding gift.  Way better and more meaningful than sparing your life and giving you water, right, Xiyang?\n* ***That said I don’t dislike Xiyang.*** **I think she is young and naive.**\n   * I am used to seeing 17-18 year olds in historical dramas that act like they are in their late 20s maturity wise and that’s what I’m used to as a viewer.  I speculate that's what many of us are used to seeing.\n   * For Xiyang, I just remind myself that she’s a true sheltered privileged TEEN.\n   * Please ... no slander and hate towards Xiyang in the comments.  Critiques are welcome but let's not wish pain and misfortune.\n\n**My note to the Princess:**   Xiyang - [I finally woke up on Jingshi yesterday and stopped expecting redeeming qualities for him](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1o0u8nv/comment/nicjdan/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). Please wake up ASAP and join us in our dislike for Jingshi’s lack of care for the people in his country and his hatred of kids that he wants them tortured and as killing machines. Get out before you have a child, Xiyang. You can do it girl. We’ve seen glimpses of your strength and bravery.\n\n**Notes from the Road Confrontation:**\n\n* Stepping over Weiran was savage\n* Yixiao siding with Feng Suige was rewarding to watch.\n\n**Back to the main couple:**\n\n* Her love confession. I liked it. On brand with her being empowered. I liked that she confessed first even though we've been seeing on Suige's face and with his gestures for a couple of episodes.\n* First kiss - awkward. I’ve been liking the main couple and was wanting more. I was sitting there silently chanting another kiss please. Make it better. And they delivered. With northern lights included.\n\n[We have a couple!](https://preview.redd.it/6g2qr3ewaxtf1.jpg?width=2688&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05fba6ef32041d80c5a48b8c5fad1bba1b0d3474)\n\n**Episode 18 Observations**\n\n* Weiran - “The fact that the Three Heroes of Jinxiu ended up like this was all my fault.” You deserve some blame. But don’t forget to blame your master who groomed you in a death camp.\n   * Are you so down with the great cause, Weiran, that you’ve forgiven him for raising you in a death camp? Or is he hiding that part of his great plan from you?\n* Ancient surgery for Yixiao.\n* Blaming the First Prince for letting his sister and Xia Jingshi go.\n   * These ministers have one recorded track that they play over and over - ***blame the First Prince***.\n* Eunuch recognizes Dad Doc at Wutong Mansion. This community's theories that the Emperor is his secret patient gets further support.\n* Eunuch Ma giving Feng Suige a pep talk to allow himself to be scolded for family unity sake.\n* The Emperor father twisting the truth.\n   * Xiyang lied to you sir? When she was a kid saying she would ever marry and always be your daughter.\n   * Weren’t you the one encouraging that she accepts this marriage alliance?\n   * Weren’t you sending her to Jinxiu until your son defied you and set a strategy in motion to have matrilocal marriage? Come on writers. You’ve done well with this show. This was a hiccup.\n* Feng Suige declaring that his father won’t get a political marriage out of him.\n\n[Feng Suige and his Dad - After I took this image, I realized we had a mirror in the scene on the left. ](https://preview.redd.it/60tldgvpaxtf1.jpg?width=2688&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=065250e829076b05d8bec1142df3170c1df35e03)\n\n* I had been thinking that humor and witty banter form the earlier episodes has been as prominent.\n   * Cue Dad Doc’s humorous lines. He must have owed the First Prince a debt in a past live.\n   * And the humor kept coming from Dad Doc the rest of his scenes.\n* Zhuangs have infiltrated all the palace staff. That’s ominous.\n* At least Enuch Ma is likely loyal to the Emperor. We’ll see what role these Jinwa guards play in the story.\n\n[First of 3 verbal sparing between Feng Suige and Empress Zhuang](https://preview.redd.it/nvg0pp3gaxtf1.jpg?width=918&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b3e6822550226062cef77d5c56fdad06c3ce7fc)\n\n[Nice outing.

Apparently, many of my replies ended up as new comments instead of replies :p so sorry to those of you who I didn’t get to interact with more.\n\n·       **This won’t be a synopsis post as I woke up today with atypical fatigue; I started trying to write a synopsis and after a few hours with slow progress I realized it wasn’t worth it &lt;3 hopefully I’m not getting sick.**\n\n **So, please use this discussion space to post your own images, video clips, and everything you liked or did not like about episodes 15 &amp; 16. &lt;3 &lt;3**\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nThe bit I was able to get done before I needed to rest &lt;3\n\n**Episode 15**\n\nWe open right where we left off with Empress Zhuang. I was surprised she went to confront the Eldest Prince on her own. This means, in a way, that she defied the Emperor asking her to go back to the harem. It would not be fun to be related to and noticed by anyone in the Zhuang family. Here she is, thinking she is mighty, and pushing blame for actions that would ‘upset Feng Xi Yang’ wedding’ onto the people who are doing nothing other than cleaning up her mess. Just like Xia Jing Shi saying ‘don’t make me’ to Fu Yi Xiao. These people with their issues with taking responsibility. Annoying. Typical.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26xbrr52trtf1.png?width=2028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=263843495669a0ed48c6a663b8c8dd4b4d2d0a27\n\nEldest Prince ends their confrontation by saying he will give her face this time but that if anyone comes after Yi Xiao again, he will kill them. Without caring about their dignity. Total Feng Sui Ge style.\n\n \n\nMurong Yao and his father, the Elder Marquis, are both back for Princess Xi Yang’ wedding. Suspicious timing with the Dad Dr being around and Jing Shi wanting to get out of town.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/osyfjhb3trtf1.png?width=1676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c74aff04808132325093050946dff079936e349e\n\n \n\nYi Xiao overhears Lu Ke &amp; Yun Fang discussing the confrontation between Feng Sui Ge and Feng Ping Cheng. That he went to the depths of violating an imperial command to make sure to send the message that she is not to be touched. This would be both moving and upsetting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi5bcbx4trtf1.png?width=1992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a871ce3f14f38399ed3a0e3fc18183033bd66d\n\n \n\nNext we overhear another who is joining the delulu band. Empress Zhuang discusses with her father Zhuang Shen about the Emperor’s actions indicate him favoring Feng Changyang for the position of Crown Prince. This Empress is so unwise over and over again. Entitled. I dislike them both so much. Another group of “for our great cause” justifiers. Blek. Zhuang Shen wastes no time in spreading this matter to the public so that everyone knows Sui Ge has lost the Emperors favor. This really might have all been an intentional plot of Sui Ge: if this is talked about a lot, then everyone will know that touching Yi Xiao is a death sentence.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8pu6197trtf1.png?width=1998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=441de317d02f5b69012ee39a215c7c5a39dd54ba\n\nIf I didn’t detest Zhuang Shen so much, I’d almost feel bad for him. He raised a younger generation who are all inept. They were too privileged, to spoiled, too pampered and it shows. They aren’t sharp enough. They’ve had too much given to them and it leads to underestimating their opponents.\n\nI do have to wonder if Chengyang is truly such a simple person who loves all of his family. I hope he is. I wrote down in my notes about him that he is an extremely young 20 yr old.\n\n \n\nWe see young Sui Ge kneeling and pleading for what I bet is the last time till the present day. He asks his Father to find the truth and justice for his Mother and the Emperor simply walks away.\n\n&lt;See Gif 1 in comments as it is too big &gt;\n\n \n\nWe see more and more examples of why Sui Ge would believe his father doesn’t love him / is choosing to ignore issues with Zhuangs. We also see what has to be clear falsity building from the Emperor. He is tricking the Zhuangs into over-comfortableness. Slowly. Stalking them from the shadows and using Sui Ge to pounce on them as the prey they will be. These two clips really struck me. The first, his attitude even from a young age. The second, those defiant eyes as he is being struck.\n\n&lt;See Gif 2 &amp; 3 in comments as they are too big &gt;\n\n \n\nAfter paying respects to his deceased mother, QingYu, Sui Ge is met by Yi Xiao who is looking to cheer him up / distract him by giving him new clues.\n\n \n\nJing Shi shows his steely resolve by only taking a small bite of his antidote. We see him stockpiling for a future when he is no longer willing to sit under the thumb of his Emperor nor his Empress Dowager. We start to see the type of torture he has lived with for likely the majority of his life. The Eunuch who was asked to draw out the reading so he had to suffer while the antidote was in sight.  I have to say, smug eunuch’s never end well.\n\nXi Yang walks in on Jing Shi struggling to get the antidote he dropped. She will learn a tiny piece about his suffering, enough to make her empathize with him and see him as an even greater man than she already did. Xi Yang is giving all the signs that she will be completely on Jing Shi’ side after they are married. I believe she’d betray her brothers and parents for him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dkn2qo2htrtf1.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c3fa20238572bf611f1fba3ec4f3c842d9208f2\n\n \n\nAh yes, I needed to take you out here to ‘talk’ about the secret merchant. Not trying to help you relax after a bad day. Not at all.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oew48dditrtf1.png?width=2010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9124ab54d4121753c336710a52e8bb640139b6\n\n \n\nYi Xiao takes the time to draw out Sui Ge and let him talk about his soul pain that today’s events were a trigger to. Getting to spend these quiet moments with our leads is so intimate. They each share as they can, getting deeper and deeper, while offering support in their own ways. It is beautiful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9hfl8cjtrtf1.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abacb12413f30171fa602a9ca087b39bb5162909\n\nAwww, Yi Xiao offers to murder the killers of Sui Ge’ mother &lt;3 &lt;3 and off of nothing but his word hahahaha (not actually cool :p )\n\n“From now on, I will protect you and make sure no one can hurt you”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pory0ycktrtf1.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a9888a2a905f9244a4fb607f4a4b3d74882b2c1\n\n  \n“From now on, as long as I’m still in your residence, it’ll be my duty to protect you.” Yay &lt;3 Yi Xiao’ loyalty is no joke and a serious gift to be given. It is worth even more as she leaves if you are not worthy of it. Making it a clear sighted thing, not something offered without choice.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkuelzeltrtf1.png?width=1082&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46eac56ab4710ee87bf58abfed364953552b2fde\n\n\n\nAh, lo &amp; behold, the Murongs.\n\n \n\n**What did you think?**\n\n·       Share your thoughts on these episodes; I’m excited to read what you each have to say!",

    "content": "I know that this post might be futile because I haven't watched the entire drama yet. \n\nBut I just finished episode 25 and I am torn and I need to sort my thoughts, so please, bear with me.\n\nThe thing is (as lovely as the romance is) this is not a particularly deep, heavy, dark or angsty drama in any sense. It's actually rather light - not very dramatic, not action packed or gory and all conflicts are resolved quickly by the next episode the latest (and they are not that serious to begin with).\n\n**But even as a veteran drama watcher, I struggle to define where the plot is leading us.**\n\nThe SML, Wei Yan, seemed like a villain in making but they backed off from that trope for now. Keeping him on the good side is more refreshing, so I have no objections.\n\nFor several episodes it seemed that Wei Yan's father Chen Pang is set up to be the main villain...I expected a big conflict between him and Wei Yan/Wei Shao or with both, but he had barely any scenes so far.\n\nIs the main villain Lady Yu Lou? But there are only 11 episodes left and I know nothing of her motivations or her endgoal. Aside from, you know, hating the Qiao clan for ruining her happy future as Vengo Gao's wife (= valid). (btw: Anyone else finds it distractingly ridiculous that anyone could think that she was born with that obviously painted huadian?)\n\nLiu Yan now suddenly reappeared after like 15(?) episodes and immediately claimed the big evil spot &gt;!by murdering his family!&lt;. Ok, then.\n\n**It's just....I am not really grasping what the main conflict is supposed to be, or who is the \"final boss\" so to speak.** \n\n**I understand that this is romance-driven show and the politics is mostly just the background for the lovestory to play out and I would be 100% ok with that BUT!!**\n\n**I accidentally read some random spoilers** &gt;!&gt;!\\- apparently Wei Liang is supposed to die? - and I am so confused, because killing off a beloved character like that, who very much serves as comic relief!&lt;!&lt;is completely at odds with the overall fairly lighthearted vibe of the drama. \n\nNot saying it's a comedy, but how do they even justify going from romance driven drama that mostly deals with minor domestic issues to that?\n\n(don't give me more big spoilers, I am trying to hold myself back from reading through MDL spoiler section like a madwoman)\n\n**Sorry for the rant, like I said, I just needed to write this out to sort out my thoughts a little.**",

    "title": "TOP 10 C-Dramas for the week (September 29- Oct 05)",
    "content": "Love's Ambition record breaking week? For viewers who often wonder, ***“What should I watch besides my favorite actor’s latest drama?”*** \\- this ranking guide offers a good starting point. It highlights the most-watched Chinese dramas of the week while also introducing lesser-known yet high-quality series that are gaining strong reception in China but may still be under the radar for global audiences. Within the top 10, you’ll find not only shows featuring big-name stars but also hidden gems with relatively unknown casts that are attracting attention through compelling storytelling and solid production. Keep in mind that a single week’s ranking doesn’t necessarily reflect a drama’s overall quality- it simply shows what most audiences are watching at the moment. However, if a series continues to remain in the top 10 for several weeks, it may be a strong indication of consistent quality and widespread appeal.\n\nTOP 10 DRAMAS (**Dramas that are airing on both TV/WEB are excluded from the Web List**)\n\n**Bold**\\- New Entry / **Bold +** ***Italics***\\- New No. 1\n\n|RANK|WEB (platforms)       |TELEVISION (tv)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|***Love's Ambition (Zhao Lusi, William Chan)- modern*** (1st week)|Growing Together S2 (Zhang Jiayi, Chen Hao)- modern comedy (2nd week)|\n|2|Time Raiders (Francis Ng, Xu Zhenxuan)- modern|Hunting (Wang Yang, Zhang Youhao)- modern|\n|3|The Journey of Legend (Cheng Yi, Guli Nazha)-costume|Wild Ambition Bloom (Rayzha, Tony Yang)- republican|\n|4|Hilarious Family Season 2 (Li Jiaqi, he Saifei)- costume|The Guardians (Zhang Yishen, Elvis Han)- republican|\n|5|**Fated Hearts (Li Qin, Chen Zhe Yuan)- costume**|This Thriving Land (Yang Mi, Ou Hao)- republican|\n|6|**Justice is Mine (Nick Cheung, Myolie Wu)- modern**|**Silent Honor (Yu Hewei, Wu Yue)- republican**|\n|7|Mobius (Bai Jingting, Janice Man)- modern|The Long Way Back (Hun Jun, Li Naiwen)- republican|\n|8|Twelve Letters (Zhou Yiran, Wang Yinglu)- modern|Legend of the Female General (ZhouYe, Cheng Lei) costume|\n|9|Golden Forest (Roger Kwok, Hera Chan)- modern|Zhen Di (Feng Shaofeng, Li Chen)- republican|\n|10|Shadow Love (Song Yi, Cheng Lei)- costume|Our Home land (Wang Lei, Yuqi Chen)- Republican |\n\n# This Week's Highlights\n\n**What to watch?**\n\n**TV Drama**\n\nNot much happening in tv dramas lately. If you hate costume dramas in the web and don't want to watch them, perhaps try hunting. **Hunting** moved from 8 to 2nd position. It is shaping up as a good entry in the Chinese anti-drug / crime drama genre. Its ambition, commitment to realism, and focus on lesser told angles (female roles, modern trafficking methods) make it stand out from formulaic counterparts.\n\nIf it maintains narrative coherence, balances its multiple threads well, and ensures emotional impact doesn't get lost in technical detail, it has the potential to be memorable. So far, early feedback is favorable, and viewership metrics suggest it’s garnering interest.\n\n**WEB Drama**\n\n**Time Raiders**\\- **Time Raiders (2025)** looks like a promising adaptation for fans of grave-raiding adventure, mystery, and team dynamics. It leans into the lore of 盗墓笔记 while trying to bring fresh energy with new casting and episodic structure. If you like suspense, puzzles, artifact hunting, and slow world-building, this is likely to be rewarding. But if you demand tight emotional arcs or perfect execution early on, you might find some moments underwhelming until the story fully picks up.\n\n**Love's Ambition**\\- It is shaping up to be a drama with more ambition (no pun intended) than your average modern romance. It offers: A more layered, character-driven conflict rather than just love vs obstacles, Emotional and psychological tension through secrets and identity, Strong leads whose chemistry is creating buzz. However, its success will depend heavily on whether it can keep surprises, deepen emotional stakes, and avoid slipping into clichés. If you like modern dramas with both heart and intrigue, this one is likely to reward you - especially once the plot thickens. \n\n**Fated Hearts**\\- At this stage, it shows strong promise. It hits many of the right notes: Intriguing setup with built-in tension, Solid production values and visual flair, A romantic arc with emotional stakes beyond mere love, and enough political / intrigue layers to elevate it beyond a simple historical romance. If the writing stays sharp, character motivations remain clear, and the leads grow in chemistry further, this could be a standout in 2025’s costume C-drama lineup.\n\n*Ranking Process*\\- This has been designed to be the ''Mother of all rankings''. I am using the average of data across Kuyun, Yunhe, Vlinkage, Douban charts, and Datawin, weightage at 20% each. The mean value is recalculated dynamically for each consultant, for each day, and for every drama, for a period of 7 days.\n\n*For further details, please check: Original post (details about ranking and other notes):* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top\\_10\\_cdramas\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_week\\_32/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top_10_cdramas_for_the_week_week_32/)",

    "title": "📢 Guide: How to critique actors respectfully",
    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nIt is the philosophy of our sub to allow critiques of actors and their dramas. But to keep conversations respectful and on-topic, here’s a quick guide: \n\n✅ **Allowed:**\n\n* “Their acting felt flat in emotional scenes.”\n* “They weren’t convincing as \\[character\\].”\n* “The script didn’t use their strengths well.”\n\n❌ Not Respectful (and may be removed or locked):\n\n* “They’re ugly/talentless/dull/stupid/idiots.” (Personal attacks)\n* “Only idiots like this actor.” or \"You are an idiot for liking this actor\". (Insulting fans)\n* “They look like a \\[body-shaming remark\\].”\n\nActors are people. Critique the role, not their looks or worth.\n\n*Disagreements don’t mean rudeness.* Reply civilly if you disagree. If you find yourself getting a little feisty on the keyboard, it's time to move away. The block function is a useful button.\n\n# Still unsure? Here's a quick checklist on spotting personal attacks\n\nAsk yourself: Does the comment…\n\n1. **Insult the person** (not the performance)?\n   * ✅ *\"His acting was wooden.\"* → **Respectful** (critiques skill)\n   * ❌ *\"He’s a talentless hack.\"* → **Personal attack**\n2. **Mock someone’s looks/body**?\n   * ✅ *\"The costume didn’t flatter her.\"* → **Respectful**\n   * ❌ *\"She’s built like a toothpick.\"* → **Body-shaming**\n3. **Attack fans** for liking/disliking something?\n   * ✅ *\"I don’t get why people like this show.\"* → **Allowed**\n   * ❌ *\"Only morons stan this actor.\"* → **Not allowed**\n4. **Use exaggerated, dehumanizing words**?\n   * ✅ *\"This casting was a miss.\"* → **Allowed**\n   * ❌ *\"This actor ruins everything like a cancer.\"* → **Not allowed**\n\n**Still unsure?** Think: *\"Would I say this to their face in public?\"* If not, rephrase!\n\n# How you can help keep discussions respectful \n\nThe truth is, mods won’t be able catch everything, so we rely on members to also keep discussions fun and fair. \n\nWe also don't believe in policing every thread; we believe that sub members can handle discussions like adults. (Right? *Right??* Don't let us mods down.)\n\nHere's how you can help:\n\n* Remind others gently if they cross the line (“Hey, keep it about the performance!”).\n* Reports are for personal attacks, not opinions you dislike. (Seriously, false reports slow us down.)\n* Block users who annoy you\n* Hide the post from your feed\n\n Still, we get it, tempers flare.\n\nThis is where we get serious and say that if you are consistently breaking Rule 4: Be Nice, we would have to enforce a ban on you. If you get a modmail saying you broke a rule, don’t ignore it. \n\nWe don't want to end up banning you, because we want you to continue hanging out in the sub, so we please take this seriously.  \n\n— Your Mod Team\n\nPS: This will be republished once a month as a reminder.",

When conflicts arise, Xu Yan breaks free from Shen Haoming's control and leaves without looking back. Shen Haoming, however, realizes he has fallen deeply in love and is determined to win Xu Yan back.\n\nPlease be sure to tag spoilers if you have read the novel or are watching with the express package.

For someone who has cared so much about her family asking her opinion on the matter, we have yet to see Princess Xi Yang ever ask Jing Shi on his own willingness in this matter. There is much left to be seen as far as who these two really are. Will Jing Shi be able to treat Xi Yang with respect and caring? She is clearly trying to form a relationship between them. Jing Shi has already shown himself willing to give up his morals (murdering his previous fiancé) for his larger plan.\n\n \n\nOur Three Heros of Jinxiu are having a tough time.\n\nSweet, open Ning Fei is actually thinking and this is making him drink. Fu Yi Xiao is starting to practice her archery again. Her hand slowly strengthens as her amnesia slowly lessens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qo1ueo3tltf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8617f99af58af86695de46872698caea713fa2d0\n\n \n\nThe feelings between Yi Xiao and Feng Suige deepen as we watch. He asks why she does things that make those close to her grieve and her enemies glad. Yi Xiao declares, for the millionth time, that her affairs are none of his business. He vows to make them his business and in Yi Xioa’ haste to get away from this disturbing statement, she cuts Sui Ge with the arrow he grasps. You can see the regret that she has caused him pain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hco2xwe5tltf1.png?width=2040&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9ddf14cfa26866319cc372d7e5aa81395069595\n\nYi Xiao goes on to set the record straight for what they mean to each other. They are working together, that is all. She has had two questions since waking with amnesia: who killed her? Why did they want her dead? Once she has these answers, the partnership they’ve agreed on will be over. Sui Ge once again alludes that he has personal experience with betrayal by loved ones and shows that he is capable of reasoned, empathetic responses (sometimes 😉 ). After Yi Xiao dismisses his ability to understand her feelings, Sui Ge continues to show his sincerity towards her by telling about the death of his beloved Mother, the previous Empress.  \n\nIn Sui Ge’s mind: his mother was murdered by the now Empress Zhuang, his father turned a blind eye, he was forbidden from ever speaking of his birth mother again, the Nanny he’d grown up with tried to burn him alive to gain favor with Empress Zhuang, and then his swordsmanship instructor used one of their lessons to try to stab Sui Ge through. Wow. Anyone would have serious trust issues after this. Yet he goes on to choose to build family with his siblings and with his military comrades.\n\nThis moment between our leads feels like the first time Yi Xiao is willing to acknowledge Sui Ge as a person person. Not just a prince, nor a partner whom both are using towards their own ends. But as someone who was once a child, abandoned. I am reminded of Jing Shi saying that no one could touch Yi Xiao when she was first rescued from the death camp. Her shying away and recoiling, almost feral. I am sure that our eldest prince can relate to the hyperawareness that would develop as a result of each of their own child hood traumas.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkv55o68tltf1.png?width=2004&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b0be95382b8ff3b906897c19f626b0983157d47\n\n\n\nAhh, our one light-hearted and emotionally equal pairing is continuing to develop :p\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nc8z34catltf1.png?width=2002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c92746314a73593b06ffd938c8f0921b34149c3d\n\nI agree with everyone that our medical savant Ling Xue Ying is a bit sus. Why is she so attached to Yi Xiao? From saving her life? To be fair, if given the opportunity to have friend like Yi Xiao, I’d jump on that too. Xue Ying seems to be at home alone a lot without her father there. She is another one of our cast who is looking to build chosen family. But is she more than just emotionally too alone and a little odd? Is she instead tying herself to Yi Xiao for other purposes? We’ll have to wait to see.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qoy3wuvbtltf1.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b2f921fc42fd278c821540054fe3214c6681e12\n\nWe learn more about the childhood shared by Ning Fei, Wei Ran, and Yi Xiao. So sad. So horribly sad. To have such ties, and have them broken, when you’d survived again and again through ridiculously poor odds by relying on each other; oofta. The pain of that would leave anyone numb for a very long time.  \n\nAs Yi Xiao is sharing about how their lives were so mutually dependent, we get more “encouraging” this-is-real-life pep talk from our Eldest Prince haha. He points out the everything in life can change. Yi Xiao asks the question on everyone’s mind: can the past really be left in the past? Can we put down revenge? This is the question of this series. Two countries just at war, now trying for peace. Can we truly put down our own pain to allow for the growth of a more healthy world?\n\n \n\n“If His Highness ordered Yi Xiao’ death, would you kill her or not?”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43q9u4cdtltf1.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e57264fecf0805673d062d1771d55986e907551\n\nPoor Ning Fei is realizing that Sui Ge did not lie. Wei Ran is responsible for the assassination attempts on Yi Xiao. And beyond that -- something I hadn’t thought of – he sent the three orphans who is basically an Uncle to, to be used as bait to lure out their adoptive Mom so that she could be killed. When your “great cause” takes these types of sacrifices from innocent others who haven’t consented, you are not on the right side.\n\nLook at Yi Xiao, so ruthless going straight for the sweet potato of memory! Thus, the three Heroes of Jinxiu are no more. Yin Xiao declares she is no longer beholden to Jinxiu and she will not let herself be killed for some “great cause”. Yay!\n\n \n\nNing Fei being sent to the secret healers with blood transfusions is interesting. We’ve ended the three heros arc with 1 – missing in action with secret healers; separate from the world. 2 – with Jing Shi; not making their own decisions. 3 – with Sui Ge; living for themselves. Could these mystic healers be related to the strange poison in Jing Shi? To the masked man who is most likely Murong Yao?\n\nI do like the outro and intro songs for this series &lt;3 I have yet to look up their translations but the feelings they evoke move me.\n\n**Episode 14**\n\nLooks like we are getting some more time with Ling Feng, Master of the Righteous Villa. Master Ling Feng seems to have known the late Empress and her personality sounds hilarious! Much like her son.\n\n \n\nThe collusion threads start to be found &amp; we are given our first name: Meng Junran. Rongtong Escort Agency is escorting funds. Fu Yi Xiao finally has her chance to confront Xia Jing Shi. While her memories are still mostly not her own, her emotions and emotional reactions truly feel like they are. Here we see the fateful moment where Yi Xiao doesn’t listen to Jing Shi. And more than not listening, she questions the morals of his choices. He planned to sacrificed the people of Zhennan Pass, not even soldiers, civilians, for his “great ambition”. Once again, we are seeing that like Feng Sui Ge, Yi Xiao is highly principled. She “passes” her morality tests that would come up for anyone in war while the Prince she loved does not.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3u8za9gtltf1.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc5d7ac8d7f4dc85748669b9bd0d50fcc82e5cc0\n\nWe learn even more about the type of person Jing Shi is. He says and believes that if he had even the tiniest bit of soft-heartedness in him, he would not have lived to see this day. Let us all note this about his character and how he has responded to the world experiences he has had.\n\nYi Xiao tells her love that she wants to make a decision for their future, just as Jing Shi claims to be doing. The decision she wants to make is to stop her Prince from continuing down a path of ruthlessness; one that has already led to him condoning mass murder (300K lives in Zhennan Pass). I am touched by Yi Xiao. She concludes with “will you let me?”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ao7zh07ltltf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4276333f663618f1a8790fb24829a0b10bc7d0c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iw8uetbmtltf1.png?width=2032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b6d2ebb71b1b61907672fa2fdd01a6e98279e34\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/573kkoentltf1.png?width=2012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ac555146e962ddc66a233c82dca1bccac89e77b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fc3aaceotltf1.png?width=1998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4390ad7fcfa8f01738db1fed7cc228df3ac093ff\n\nAnd so we conclude the arc of: who wanted to kill me? Why did they want me dead? This has been our driving force behind Yi Xiao to this point. Yet these answers are only the beginning of the threads that Feng Sui Ge must unwind.\n\nI find this shot of Xia Jing Shi combined with the lyrics “Shadows take root in the mountain pass” well done. Who would not have shadows growing in their mind after murdering their closest, most loved one? To have to confront the truth of your own ruthlessness would be soul breaking. Is this what is meant by having the bearing of a ruler?  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rxw0v08qtltf1.png?width=2012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b313105b685b23f8427081da431d96a0b896c7b\n\nThe closing conversation on the relationship between Fu Yi Xiao &amp; Xia Jing Shi was also moving. Her telling him he looked ridiculous as he pleaded with her to start over with him, that when he shot that arrow, the old Fu Yi Xiao died.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ozaa4pkutltf1.png?width=2022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1aeb2ec0c80f24e2856d129a61d99717e4cd0c39\n\nHow honorable is Yi Xiao? She clearly expresses her gratitude for being saved by Jing Shi; express that gratitude has been absorbed by him shooting her; lets him know that if they do meet again, they will be enemies. Nothing in the shadows, all open and aboveboard. I really enjoy a forthright person.\n\n \n\nClosing out Yi Xiao’ past: enter Sui Ge with another well timed catch 😊\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7f24x6wtltf1.png?width=1922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0136a8ada282e626ef98728ba94a2ab04444e8d6\n\nYi Xiao offering our Eldest Prince some of her first real softness, first real emotions. I find this smile before she faints beautiful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9qbutr4ytltf1.png?width=1936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57625da8143804d4eeb79cecf52e4e105aa63469\n\n \n\nI’d like to take a moment to say that going around to light all those candles by hand would be an act of pure love haha. There are SO MANY!\n\n \n\nWe learn that the blood clot in Yi Xiao’ brain could burst with too much stimulation. Naturally, we’ll assume this will come back to haunt us later at a very emotional, very inopportune time :p\n\n \n\nFor those of us hoping for my genuine emotional connection time between our MLs, I feel we’ve really started to get into it with these two episodes! Most exciting.\n\n \n\nWAIT! As our leads discuss the golden armor, I am reminded that Murong Yao gave it to Sui Ge before the attack on Pingling City. Am I remembering that wrong? Or was Murong Yao trying to make certain sure that Sui Ge would make it inside of the city to fall into the trap? Was it a gift made to facilitate the death of Sui Ge?\n\n \n\nSome potential foreshadowing of future issues for our couple. We learn that the former Empress was a general herself; free-spirited and valiant. Someone who yearned for a life of peace &amp; simplicity, away from the regular hustle of life. Not too dissimilar to both Yi Xiao and Sui Ge. Sui Ge shares that his mother would never have agreed to be trapped inside the palace if it wasn’t for her love for his father. Will Sui Ge make assumptions about Yi Xiao in the future based off of this interpretation of his mother?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a9qk03u0ultf1.png?width=1946&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d9603084a3882dc1e6a6451a54ce055a3d7cd05\n\n\n\nA loving couple. A happy family. No wonder Sui Ge creates family wherever he goes and values it so much.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgeih9l3ultf1.png?width=2044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9c79fbdcdb8351dc09144364b56a9f705c8433e\n\n\n\nOur man is sending out all the signals that he wants her to seek him 😊\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bg7v7f15ultf1.png?width=1652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ef64f93a58da6c55d24f5a67456cc5bc59b2149\n\nSui Ge reiterates that Yi Xiao can leave; she is a person, not a thing. He offers to find her a beautiful, peaceful place to take her children to. An out from the complicated political things.\n\nHehehehhe I do love Yi Xiao making Sui Ge uncomfortable :p just like the previous scene by the river. LOL an amazing fake out by Yi Xiao! Can Sui Ge be any more cute with his discomfort, shyness, and happiness all rolled into one?!?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uekc4xh7ultf1.png?width=1932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00becc281beb1904fd2ae9aae613823cf95c414e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84qndox8ultf1.png?width=2038&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a86fcc780197f70de4731bd65ef7cff105ec3ddd\n\nSui Ge fanning the bug repellant into her sleeping chamber &lt;3\n\nFlowers for calming beauty when she wakes &lt;3\n\n \n\nThey do a good job so far in this show of making sure we see the humanity in each of our characters. The distant cousin of Empress Zhuang who was supposed to assassinate Yi Xiao is another good example of this. The music that is our cue for love and loss and hope and separation played when he saw his young daughter through the back gate of their home. He loves her and cannot go to her.\n\n \n\nWe see the tension between Feng Sui Ge and Feng Ping Cheng increase. The child is unsatisfied with his father’s handling of the murder of his Mother. I am sure that what the Eldest Prince doesn’t know about the situation is  a lot. I am looking forward to this story being unwound more.\n\n \n\n**What did you think?**\n\n·       Share your thoughts on these episodes; I’m excited to read what you each have to say!\n\n·       Let me know any pointers you might have on my hosting as it is my first time.

    "content": "Hello again, good people of the CDrama subreddit ❤️ I have returned to once again to yap about Under the Power now that I have almost finished the show. Yes, I am the one that just posted about it like 7 days ago here 💀: https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/s/KnCfgRgiaj\n\nAll of you that mentioned the CGI/special effects being bad sure were correct. The ghost ship immediately made me giggle and I’m not even going to bring up that one horse riding scene… like oof… 😂\n\nBut omg 🥹 Lu Yi and Yuan Jinxia together is so cute! They had such sweet chemistry and I look like an idiot smiling at the screen when I watch them. \n\nPersonally, I really didn’t mind that the crime solving went away and the focus became much more narrowed on to the families plus their relationships. I think it made a lot of sense tbh given that all the early cases do have everything to do with the Yan family and that becomes more and more evident as time goes on. I’m not done yet with the show but I do generally know what happens because I spoiled it for myself lol Despite this not being the best written drama story line perhaps, I found it to be still thoroughly enjoyable. The cast they got for this drama really worked hard! \n\nI’ve also gotten used to the voice dubbing. It took a few episodes for me to shake off the fact that I was overly aware of their real voices but it didn’t impact my ability to enjoy what was happening. \n\nI will probably take a break from Ren Jia Lun’s dramas for a little bit after this one and try to grit my teeth and ready my eyes (tears) through The Story of Yanxi Palace because I’ve kept that one on my watch list for too long. But I’ve got Love of Nirvana on my watch list now!!! \n\nI’m curious what you all thought about &gt;!how Lu Ting went about planning against the Yan family (I feel like he could have told Lu Yi earlier and things would have worked out better), Constable Yang’s decision and attempt to try to keep Jinxia’s identity from being known by her and everyone else, and ye olde silly attempt to make things up to someone and “not hurt them” by pretending you don’t want to be with them anymore 🤦🏻‍♀️. !&lt; And of course, overall, any other thoughts about the show!! Wish I had more people IRL to chat about this with 😂 \n\nFinal thing I will say about the story is, JFC XIE XIAO GOT SO ANNOYING FOR SO LONG. I’m glad he eventually opened his eyes and unsmoothed his brain but sheesh. \n\nWould absolutely love to see our ML and FL come back together for a drama in the future. They’re both so great at their job and have had fantastic dramas since Under the Power. I would be so hyped!\n\nEdit to add: 祝大家中秋快乐🎑✨！",

I will still see you in the comment threads! Thank you to the lovely co-hosts [u/emotional-vegetable1](https://www.reddit.com/user/emotional-vegetable1/) and u/beautiful_candle1729 who will be hosting some of the following episodes. In between, there will be automods, thank you u/alcibiad for creating those!\n\n**Spoilers** If you'd like to discuss anything beyond Episode 12, please use spoiler tags.\n\n**Episode 11 \"I won't go back on my word.\"**\n\n* We open with the scary Empress Dowager who is not impressed by her son's choice of lifestyle. Be more like an Emperor she tells him, and he's like, what? Like, Xia Jingshi, who is now going to be the live-in son-in-law of the enemy state?\n* It's funny to see her reaction to Xia Jingyan's, and the the Susha Emperor's reaction to Suige's respective letters they sent with huge ramifications.\n* Yixiao asks Ning Fei again what happened after the Battle at Pingling. Seems like the last person to see her was the Prince.\n* Jingshi wants to take Yixiao away from Susha as soon as possible before anything unexpected happens. Weiran tells Jingshi that Suige is hard to read, more so than the Emperor, and if become Emperor, it would mean the downfall of Jinxiu.\n* Yixiao starts to test Jingshi and Weiran more and more boldly! I am loving the little knowing looks between the characters. This is like cat and mouse. But, it shows the Prince is still all in for Yixiao. He drinks the medicine she brought him, tell her he will listen to her.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7193v952cetf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dd9cf78003ad345f75c8d59d5d45c06d2f25f5f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aobgewu2cetf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f273e59432bcb4d61ab142498c69bf9dba02f94\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9am6lgs3cetf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a75fb0a1d466105d8697bf7d3c45bf4ff999b28\n\n* I like how the Prince said to Weiran to stop being so suspicious! It is so suspenseful when both sides are testing each other. There are lies all around, who can you trust? And wow, Yixiao looks at him and says she would not let the person who shot her go. We get to see the Prince squirm.\n* Yixiao questions Ning Fei again, this time, he remembers there was another party present. A suspicious merchant.\n\n[Yixiao confronting Weiran. Now that was heart-stopping for him.](https://preview.redd.it/44urt8nibetf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fd8b672ae61f635baed4ad2dede01b8aae399d1)\n\n[Yixiao confronting Jingshi! Boy, that was tense! I didn't image she would outright tell him she thought the shooter was him.](https://preview.redd.it/amgt4wgiaetf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bb7a8f93960d4310eb9ce701f5d0e1bf8c8c76f)\n\n[ He is scared now. ](https://preview.redd.it/wy20chyebetf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d60d4b676e747c24a465dd02cd27fddc230f3547)\n\n[Yixiao realises that Suige knew Jingshi was the culprit and has been trying to protect her all along. He gives her a mystery gift. ](https://preview.redd.it/p9m7rfigaetf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c88b22076cf2d4e2cd57d363d2b4fac794ff7d3d)\n\n* Oof, the ministers want to impeach the First Prince.\n\n**Episode 12**\n\n* The reply from the Jinxiu Emperor has arrived. The proposal has been accepted! The First Prince has been saved from impeachment. Go you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8f2dpu3detf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d1fc03699b515e404055f5e45b6e239069e937a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ro42vpt4detf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=900988d41e5306f391e004e5a727ef38059dad65\n\n[Take that, Prime Minister!](https://preview.redd.it/8h65u2p5detf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=776310ff9cc55d69def5999c5242a68c5ca7e6c1)\n\n[The Emperor is proud of his son.](https://preview.redd.it/pa5raff6detf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=717c53cde81acce523242c3934fae0ea09d9cfc8)\n\n* My favourite sequence of the series so far, other than the fighting choreography in the forest in the first episode: Li Qin and the actor of Weiran acted their hearts out. It was outstanding. She let him go, but Suige arrives and captures him.\n\n[It's Suige's chainmail! He saved her life. ](https://preview.redd.it/5ypmqiydhetf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07a5ecac9bfa488b19fceec2956250f0ae864a7b)\n\n[This sequence was devastating. The actors expressions were so good here. I can't get over it.](https://preview.redd.it/jt0tytlehetf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f3a311e94cd5866b8d6db09ab8498288a40d714)\n\n* Okay, but was anyone else confused as to how Yixiao and Weiran both seemed quite normal after what seemed like a battle to the death with all those sword slashes and stabs and blood everywhere? I thought we were going to get some fainty wound caring from Suige with Yixiao, but I guess we are still too early to stray into romantic wound care.\n\n[Suige looks over Yixiao. She is sharpening her weapons.](https://preview.redd.it/33eb6wibietf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c90fd36bd2c014c50adbb99641e93ef2e50cfed4)\n\n[Ning Fei learns the truth from Suige.](https://preview.redd.it/zopevat6ietf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b839802e84f2950a1399fbfec31595295b254c8)\n\n[The plans for the Prince to marry into Susha has far reaching consequences for the Princess who was planning on living a free life. ](https://preview.redd.it/ubxwgkkiietf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1ddad6355aa0250d9936ff708a65c6d1fd2f7be)\n\n[Oh, hoho, all the guards falling into position around his new residence. You are caged now. But, what is this? The Prime Minister has other plans for him after the wedding. The Prince's expression after hearing that is almost chilling.](https://preview.redd.it/7zsokg9vietf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd11eddbd7ae90c24c4820d3c605697e09a00462)\n\n* The episode ends with the Princess arriving at the residence. How will the Prince react?\n\n**Questions and thoughts**\n\n* How the relationship between the Jinxiu three and the Prince will play out. Will they ever get back on the same side? Is this like (spoilers for another drama: &gt;!My Journey to You, which I didn't finish, but I think the second ML started off like villain but joined hands with ML in the end?!&lt;) The trailer for the next episodes show &gt;!Yixiao breaking off their sworn brotherhood with the other two devastated and sobbing - I feel sorry for Weiran, he is always so stoic and he even almost killed Yixiao but he looks like such a poor baby here.!&lt;\n* Previous comments have mentioned a spoiler in the ending credits: &gt;!Where the Princess of Susha ends up in Jinxiu and not having the life she imagined. !&lt; I look forward to this arc in how it affects Jingshi's character development.\n* I like how both ML and FL's story developments are still largely separate but connected. I do want to see more screen time between them but I can also appreciate how it will make it much more better when they actually do start to be closer. The slow burn is good. They have enough to deal with separately at the moment.\n* I like how we are not too bogged down with all the political stuff and those scenes are only the really relevant ones to the main plot.\n\nThe emotions are ramping up and it is getting quite exciting! Over to you!",

    "content": "i’m talking pause the show several times just to read them the riot act behind the screen. frustration to the power of ten. getting overly familiar with the skip button cuz you can’t even hate watch their scenes. characters that genuinely enrage you. characters that- even if they’re given a sympathy plot line- couldn’t move you if they tried. \n\ni’m fresh off a rewatch of some of my favorite dramas and have started and finished at least 2 new ones so i have my list locked and loaded😭 \n\nthese are the characters that have frustrated me to no end:\n\n\nthe emperor (empresses in the palace)- he has a name. i won’t use it. i would say that wretched man will crumble but zhen huan was already ten steps ahead and handled him in my stead. i couldn’t stand him ever in the drama but i felt my frustration peak with the dress debacle. there was no logical way for that to have been zhen huan’s fault. usually with schemes meant to sow discord between two characters an explanation is at least partly necessary to make it clear whoever is being schemed against is faultless. but here it’s like ??? she didn’t even need to explain! that quite literally COULDNT have been her fault- and yet here he goes. blaming my girl. a loser\n\n\nerqing (yanxi palace)- you’ve heard of delusion, get ready for the new and improved erqing exclusive version!! i tried to understand her, but she was ridiculous and my mind doesn’t work that way. it was a lost cause. \n\n\nwei ting yu (blossom)- i won’t lie and say i wasn’t holding on to some resentment towards him from the 15 minutes of dou zhao’s first life we all saw. cuz i absolutely was!! but he did enough in their second life to make him my least favorite character all over again. just so incredibly incapable. he didn’t do anything right and if he did, it was the efforts of 5 other people with more sense than him pushing, shoving, and then carrying him in the right direction. you know you’re broke! but won’t get a job! you paint all day! but won’t sell your paintings or take criticisms of them! he tried once (ONCE) but felt he was being low balled on the price. i’m like.. at this point does that matter? you’re BROKE! take that little 1000 coins and sell another painting tomorrow. tuh\n\n\nthe first crown prince (royal feast)- yet another incapable man. he’s not a bad guy but when his father had to issue and order throughout the whole palace just to get him to eat his vegetables? at his big age? it was a wrap. the cooks were disguising vegetables in his food like he was a toddler. something about grown men acting like children while also being in positions of power irritates me. if someone told me the crown prince, the future emperor himself, won’t eat a vegetable unless ordered to by his father and can’t ride a horse i would’ve started the rebellion my damn self. \n\n\nthere are several others but i’m wordy i won’t make this more of a novel than it already is😭 \n\nwhat characters can you not stand? and if there’s none that you really genuinely dislike, which sympathy arcs just didn’t work on you? you don’t dislike the character but you certainly don’t feel for them. \n\nalso this is no hate to any of the actors, i’m talking exclusively about the characters they’re playing!! in fact this is a compliment to them, characters are meant to make us feel things and these actors really did their big one🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️",

Some mention that she's quite GL coded\n* Everyone is enjoying the real enemies to lovers trope\n* The strategist and the prince are the likely culprits behind Yixiao's cliff fall\n* The comments in the previous discussions are really insightful and adds to the excitement of following an airing show with other viewers!\n\n**Episode 9 \"If fate shows no mercy, then don't blame my recklessness.\"**\n\n* Suige doesn't have an appetite since Yixiao is meeting Jingshi. His buddy was funny imagining then crying and hugging.\n* Jingshi claims to protect Yixiao for life, asks her to come home and offers her her bow back. She declines the bow.\n* Yixiao apologises for wrongly accusing him of preventing Jingshi from meeting her. I love her pretends not to care but secretly looks at what she's doing through his window. Both the female voice and male voiced osts are beautiful here\n* Yixiao left the manor but was thoughtful enough to leave a secret message and Suige appreciate her collaboration. Does anyone know what the cricket means?\n* The minister who agreed to the extra prisoner swap of Yixiao is so funny. Who would dare to take someone from the First Prince's manor?\n* The Emperor's words about Suige using Yixiao by pulling one thread to move the entire fabric is very cool to show how much forethought the First Prince is putting into his plans and is bigger we think it is.\n* I also love how the Emperor knows Suige would even kill Jingshi and burn down the Emperor's palace to stop the marriage if he didn't approve. That he is daring but sticks to his principles. We see this in how he feels for and protects Yixiao since she has been hunted by one of her own\n* Suige now has proof of collusion between the Prime Minister and someone from Jinxiu's undercover guard.\n* Yixiao learns by getting Ning Fei drunk that he was told she accidentally fell off the cliff and that Jingshi received intelligence and suddenly changed battle plans that she wasn't told about.  She learns that her arrow to Suige saved him from ambush. Weiran hears everything.\n* Yixiao chooses neither of her two MLs. They agree to let her choose her own path. Jingshi is confident she'll go with him when she remembers everything. Suige asks shouldn't he be scared when that day comes?\n* The Princess tried to assert her standing with Yixiao, but it doesn't affect her at all. I feel like the a princess is a bit delulu in love. The four meet at the street markets. I like how Jingshi only has eyes for Yixiao but he still treats the Princess with respect.\n* Our leads already know each other so well only after meeting for a short time, they know the other doesn't like crowds.\n\n**Episode 10 \"I'll be your left hand\"**\n\n* Suige is so much of Yixiao's support and pillar in the archery scene and the aftermath of her flashback. I'd like to see more of this. And based on Episode 10, I'd actually like to see it from Jingshi, too. That would make things interesting\n* The four actors here did a great job with the nuances of their facial expressions at the market. We're starting to see the developing dynamics between them.\n* And so Jingshi was the one who shot at her on the cliff. I thought that with the new flashbacks of him almost dying and giving her his token to command the army, telling her to save herself, that she would sooner get her feelings back for him and get our love triangle going, but I'm also glad that it didn't sway her.  The fact that he was the one who shot her and is hiding things from her, scares her but she needs to stay and find out the truth.\n* You guys were right, it was Weiran and Jingshi. But at the moment, Jingshi doesn't know Weiran is meant to kill her.\n* Based on what Weiran said to the masked man and his reaction when the man said he'd do it himself, I think Weiran won't end up trying to kill Yixiao.\n* And now, the Empress also wants Yixiao dead\n* Suige's plan is quite a surprise, but it's a good one to keep the plot going!\n\n**What I would like to see**\n\n* More direct interaction between our leads\n* Genuine feelings coming into play between our quadrangle\n* Jingshi saving Yixiao from the Empress's assassin\n\n**Questions**\n\n* What is Jingshi's grand plan? Why can't he have his antidote before it?\n* Did the his brother the Emperor poison him?\n* Will Jingshi take care of the princess?\n\n**And over to you**, what did you like or dislike about these episodes?",

    "content": "I've been watching Cdramas for a little over a year. Maybe 50 so far of all types. so feel I have a decent grasp on how well some actors perform in my view. And I've never dropped a drama because of acting. So that being said, I just felt the need to express my feelings for on particular actor in one particular drama.\n\n  \nI'm sure most of you have heard of Meet You at the Blossom. a BL drama that wasn't exactly top tier. In fact it lacked a lot. One ML was torn apart in reviews but I'm not going to talk about that. Instead, let's talk about the other ML, Wang Yun Kai who plays Jin Xiao Bao. A carefree son of a rich family who falls in love with the other ML.  In the show he gets poisoned, a very painful poison. We see him go from a happy, sincere, in love young man to one that can barely hang onto his life. His mental transition from this optimistic and hopeful person to living in agony was flawless. \n\nBut the part that got me was when each time the poison would go into effect he suffered excruciating pain. I mean bone tearing, scream into the void physical pain. That was when his performance really shined. I have never seen such a true to life expression of body pain in any drama, Chinese or Western. Each time he cried out I winced, each time he struggled to get help I tensed up. The tears were real and the 'ugly cry' was heartbreaking. I bawled my eyes out with him and for a moment thought, just put him out of his misery because neither of us can take it anymore. \n\nUnless a stagehand was shoving a hot poker in his back, this was real acting and I just wanted to express my appreciation since I watch cDramas for the feels, and he delivered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "Back for you is a 2025 republican era drama starring Wang Anyu and Angelababy. It's 12 ep and each episode deals with a case of different people, couple etc . Each cast did a fantastic job with what they have .Each of the case are deceited in comics . The first picture shows all the important characters of the cases shown in the comics . It blends mystery, emotion, and just enough romance to keep you invested. It’s not your typical love story\n\n I want to specially applaud the performance of that actress in the drama and Bing . I was surprised by Cheng Xiao appearance and she did a good job . Jelly Lin notable for her role as Yinzhang in A dream of splendor, Zhao Xun in imperfect victim did a fantastic job as sunny women . I knew she's a good actress but I've only seen her serious one only. I really liked the visual and I thought it suited the vibe . \n\nThis is the synopsis from MDL \n In the early years of the Republic of China, A Lai, a police officer in the concession, was hunted down by a vicious gang. When his life was hanging by a thread, he was rescued by a mysterious woman, Lu Na, who appeared out of thin air. Lu Na was seriously injured and fell into a coma. A Lai investigated Lu Na’s identity but found no such person.\n\nA Lai used the twelve comic books she carried with her to tell her stories, hoping to awaken her savior. Unexpectedly, every story is related to the cases A Lai has handled and can even guide A Lai in finding the key to solving the case. A Lai looked forward to Lu Na waking up more and more. A Lai was promoted and received a salary increase because of his merits in solving the case, but he also secretly made his enemies.\n\nA Lai discovered Lu Na’s secret through clues. When one of the comics was read, Lu Na woke up. The two are in love with each other, and A Lai’s enemies are also ready to take action. In the end, with the help of Lu Na, A Lai regained his peace and simplicity and his original intention of being a police officer.\n\n( Romance is not the main focus here but you'll be satisfied) Hopefully I didn't give any spoiler . It's my first time posting a rave so sorry if it's too long or it is not right.) 🙂🙂",

Thank you u/alcibiad for organising the automod posts!) will be your hosts for this drama. Let's hope this drama will satisfy our needs till the end!\n\n**Spoilers** If you'd like to discuss anything beyond episode 8, please use spoiler tags.\n\n**Episodes 1-6 \"We're safe now.\"**\n\nWe open with a creative camerawork and flashbackwards to see how our ML, Feng Suige, First Prince of Susha gets taken down with an arrow in battle by our FL, Fu Yixiao, Commander of Jinxiu, world's most brilliant archer. There's a very cinematic and symbolic juxtaposition of her red dress billowing and his blue cape flowing whilst she's high up on the tower and he is falling from his horse.\n\nFrom there, it's quite fast paced with unknown assassins in black chasing both Suige and Yixiao. Both fall from a high cliff, but in Suige's case, it was just diversion. He also had his battalion, lieutenant, commander and right-hand man helping him. Yixiao, on the other hand, was surrounded, alone, and fighting beyond exhaustion. We get some nice close up shots of her injuries. We find out later that she had just been shot down from the top of a cliff by a mystery person, leading to amnesia.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y3x0xlg2g0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56b91176091943750509af07ae1450a5fc6e55a9\n\nHere is the obligatory bath scene, the romantic trope sprinkled throughout our favourite historical dramas, with our enemies on either side of the hot spring wall, soothing their grave injuries. I guess I have to mention the abs scene as well - it was pretty bang in your face, but I appreciated the 3/4 side angle. These two handled the after bath scene pretty maturely, albeit her now being detained by him.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2frpua4g0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=babe50924dd219d59a5e08d8fb4a2522b481d6ee\n\n*As an aside, I wonder if Cheng Lei will have one in How Dare You. It doesn't look like it, so he may have broken his streak. But, there is one to look forward to in Mo Li, and his OG pair, Lu Yuxiao, will have another with Neo Hou in Love in the Clouds.*\n\nSuige has Yixiao tortured and she gets flashbacks of her past. She sees herself as child, getting brutally trained, she's an adult and we see she was together with the Prince of Zhennan, Xia Jingshi. Suige dresses her back wounds. They are still enemies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7w5b6fpfi0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d501b7c7ca0f1f4c872fc816d638ea884aae8577\n\nAt the gates to Jinxiu, Suige's battlion is stopped by one of the Prime Minister's sons and his army. Yixiao sees that things aren't so smooth sailing for her captor even though he is the First Prince and that his battalion are highly loyal, tight knit and have each other's backs. They would lay down their lives for him and each other. He must be a good leader and treats his people well. And then he kills the Prime Minister's son with his bare hand. Yixiao is shocked by his power and ruthlessness.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/icpfphbbg0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f63273a4c8f54232647d85a4860f55bc37ae4632\n\nThe Second Prince's coming of age ceremony was scheduled for this day, the day Suige's mother died, probably by the Empress, Second Prince's mother and Suige's father, the Emperor. Suige has a good relationship with his younger brother but the Empress doesn't like this.\n\nOur leads scheme to make use of each other, a cooperation of sorts. But first, Yixiao must settle some scores. This is beyond crazy. She ties him up in the forest and whips him back the 47 lashes. Random CGI forest animals pop up to be shocked at the bite kiss revenge he then takes on her. Bloody lips, from kissing biting, that's another trend.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dw3my2qdg0tf1.jpg?width=806&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ced7496007934cf770dc0693a45ca676ac8c1e24\n\nOh, hi buddy \\*waves.\\* Zuo Ye is in this too (plays Murong Yao).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/egy4yt4gg0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ed218d7b6279414bae94ee069c59b53c3a6d4f5\n\nWe have them injuring each other's injury. Their banter is very Mr and Mrs Smith vibes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdf4g5esk0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7d6531c92cdb6ea12c9d27366e5711bf7dd953e\n\nMurong Yao refuses to take back the golden chain mail he gifted Suige. I hope this doesn't foreshadow his death.\n\nThe three children, her disciples appear, looking for her. They are reunited but she doesn't remember them. One of them gets kidnapped to lure her out. On the boat, this might be the first time Suige properly comes to her rescue. She gets a flashback to the person who shot her at the cliffs. Yixiao is surprised to see Suige gentle with the sleeping child.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u2spunfog0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be5b9fe026589345b44a2330b6a4018c153d0384\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejtt80vlg0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df8ad0707bb06b1f3d8379e97e135248ee25eacd\n\nIn Suige's carriage, he sees Yixiao asleep cradling her disciple and wonders why she isn't afraid to sleep in the company of her enemy. She wakes wonders how she fell asleep and why he saved her disciple if he's meant to be ruthless. They arrive and she says to the child, \"We're safe now.\" This lingers on Suige's mind - she feels safe with him.\n\nWe end with Episode 6 where Jinxiu has offered a marriage alliance for Prince Zhennan and Suige's sister, Princess of Susha. Suige vows to stop it but Xiyang seems not to mind. Suige and  Yixiao banter and drink together.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e0d2iuj3h0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c1513ff5a2848d7b762afdaa75cc51acefc65ea\n\n**Episode 7 \"Nothing happened last night.\"**\n\nWaking up to a knife impasse on the bed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3chn3tr4h0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ee77765d6e48a854f073c4a71fa1e24cdd036e7\n\nWord got out that Suige is opposed to the marriage alliance and there are rumours that the Emperor was going to strip him of his title, that there would be mutiny among his men. The gang finds out that one of their own has gone on a rogue suicide mission to kill Prince Zhennan, Xia Jingshi. With the help of Yixiao's archery tactical knowledge, they save him. Suige gives him and his men a powerful and resolute talking to. Xia Jingshi is not worth their lives. There is to be no mutiny. He approved of the marriage.\n\nWhen Xia Jingshi arrives at the city gates, and Li Yixiao spots him. She gets PTSD flashbacks of her past. Jingshi was the one who saved her as a child. He was the one they pledged alliance to. He was one she was engaged to. They had fought together on the battlefield. So she goes insane, swinging Suige's sword, she thinks she's back in the past, fighting off enemies or in harsh training. We see Suige's concern for her. He checks if she remembers him. She does. Luckily, she faints and doesn't meet Xia Jingshi just yet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zd1ay078h0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b143c04d5edc66c3d64bc9c5e45fff0ca7eb4ff6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fjy6w239h0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=224cd839e325d298eeb9a20f18625192cbd4f447\n\nWhen we get to Xia Jingshi, the murder music plays and he has a murder face on. He must be the bad guy. His tea with the Emperor is unnerving. He does not show respect and the Emperor comments on it. The Prince replies that he would be subordinate only after the marriage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkvvccu9h0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ea64b01148b167e349b1001e2df99c912af86be\n\nWe end the episode with the revelation that the Princess loved him since he saved her in the desert. She pretended to be miliary and tried to follow her brother to battle. She fell behind in the desert and Xia Jingshi and his men found her. He let her go when he saw that she was a woman. He also threw her his water pouch which saved her life. Okay, maybe he isn't too bad after all.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/axeprj9bh0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=331d6ba59a1310304db30fdd99fcc00847aec672\n\n**Episode 8 \"You are now my person.\" \"I will never be your person.\"**\n\nThe Princess concludes that women aren't made for battle and Jingshi says no, he knows a woman who went into battle and became the best hero. So, is he really not the one who shot Yixiao? The Princess notes that she's baring her soul to him and he only has thoughts for another woman. She asks for the name of this woman. I kind of like this otp. &gt;! Seeing the trailer for eps 9 &amp; 10, I'm sad that the Princess looks like she turns bad.!&lt;\n\nThe princes meet in the street and Jingshi says he once swore to protect Yixiao for life. Suige recognises Yixiao as a human being with autonomy, not a belonging. He says that she is free to go or stay of her own free will.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jfyf6zthh0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0251826ff30bdacd7fab999aee2d90db0bff1b71\n\nNing Fei was injured by Suige as he keeps the Jinxiu guys away from Yixiao, since the one who harmed her could have been any one of them. Yixiao asks Xueying to treat Ning Fei in case they really were close. Xueying and Ning Fei looks like a ship is brewing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6dhb34jh0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3df35e33ca329ee37b4eca09574a44f18d54220\n\nWe get a flashback to Suige's investigation. They found the token of undercover agents. Agents that can only be commanded by the Jinxiu Prince and military advisor. So, maybe it *was* the Prince.\n\nThe Jinxiu buddies give Xueying a bamboo whistle to give to Yixiao. It's one she used to use so that her buddies could find and rescue her. Looks like they have been through thick and thin together.\n\nSuige sees Yixiao trying to do achery practice and stops her from continuing. He doesn't want her to ruin her arm before it recovers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mhe0hxpph0tf1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3633cd0ce61d322f5ba05d7283ac561fd35d5a0a\n\nWe end with Jingshi and Yixiao's reunion and I'm glad she's being guarded and doesn't give anything away. Doesn't acknowledge that she remembers they were together.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pw9wvvtrh0tf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=703aa04ec5e2193913290a32b0c40785be32c8ab\n\n**I Wonder**\n\nSo, over to you\n\n* What did you think of the episodes?\n* Is Prince Zhennan the culprit behind Yixiao's attempted murder?\n* Will he fall for the Princess?",

    "content": "I'm up to ep 7 or 8 of Love's Ambition, and this seems like a well-thought out drama with a lot of focus on details, so one thing threw me off - whenever the FL is having tea with the ML's parents at their home, tea is served in this fancy, English-style teapot and cups. I'm not an expert on Chinese tea culture, but I know it is considered important, supposedly a sign of good breeding/being cultured/educated and the way of serving and enjoying tea is different from European-style tea (which is British-influenced).\n\nSo having this small social gathering at the home of these two very rich and important people (ML's parents) where good breeding is supposedly very important (shown in the way the FL has to pretend her parents are scholars to be 'good enough' to date/marry Shen Haoming) and the FL gets judged for not getting the 'right' gifts for the mother-in-law. But they don't serve tea with Chinese-style teaware? And this could be my ignorance (and my cultural bias) at play, but the teapot and cups look expensive in a tacky way.\n\nMaybe I'm just overthinking a small detail, but would a well-educated, cultured rich Chinese family really use this type of teaware - or is it a sign that the Shen family is in fact tacky 'noveau riche' types who want to show off and pretend to have cultural capital, but aren't really that well-bred? \n\nOr is Jingzhou just more connected to older British-style culture so there's a tendency to lean towards Western-style design items for rich people in that area?",

    "content": "I’ve been wondering why most cdramas after I finished Love like the Galaxy in 2023 had this huge disconnect for me. Characters and storylines fell flat, it’s been long since something had pulled me in so deeply (other than Yanxi Palace, Princess Agents, Arsenal Military Academy, Journey to Love.) \n\nBut now I realize. It’s rare for dramas to not have the main leads meet in the first episode. Yes, Shaoshang and Ling Buyi met early on but it was a passing encounter. \n\nThey weren’t instantly connected to each other and “conveniently” kept meeting and getting in each other’s way. It just so happened that they were at the same places at the same time with their own personal missions and lives and love blossomed along the way.\n\n I think it’s important to develop characters and their stories before the two main love interests meet. It allows the watcher to see main leads as individuals and not just as adjacent love interests to each other, losing their selves in one another. \n\nAnyways, tell me if you agree or disagree with my opinion and let me know if you also think it’s important to have some character build up or episodes where leads are doing their own things, not connected to their love interests.

I have not seen it mentioned often or discussed a lot.\n\nMDL has it at a 7.9, but for me, so far, it's an 8.5\n\nWhy isn't it higher? The CGI, my God, it was not the best. That, for me, made it less than a 9.\n\nAdditionally, misunderstandings, lack of communication, and smart leads making poor decisions cost 0.5 points.\n\nWhy do I like it? - the angsty, the story, the romance, the OST. Just wow! \n\nI know this is a different genre, but it reminds me of Eternal Love (one of my favorites, and funny enough, they both aired in the same month. G&amp;I January 2, 2017, and ET - January 30, 2017). By the way, Eternal Love’s CGI wasn't this bad, but they were in the same year, with a lower budget, perhaps? 🤷‍♂️\n\nThere's a scene where the ML &amp; FL were separated for a while, playing blind Go against each other. They weren't sure they were playing against each other👨‍🍳🤌 wow\n\nThe ML and FL chemistry was top (similar to BQ and YH in Eternal Love) \n\nThe Martial Arts was top too 🔥\n\nAngelaBaby - she didn't KILL the role, but she certainly was far from bad. However, I could see another FL killing this role, too. (Yang Mi would lol, apparently AB was preggo at the time of filming, maybe it affected her?? Idk)\n\nI see many people who aren't fans of her acting, her lips, and so on. I only ever watched her in another 2019 drama, My True Friend.\n\nThe ML was also excellent. I only saw Wallace Chung in Sword and the Brocade. I can see he's a top actor.\n\nIf you like strategy, politics, romance, warrior ML, who is obsessed and possessive for the FL but remains a green flag, and a FL that's smart, loves her man, will die for him, but will make some silly decisions, but will look cute doing it 😅 then watch this.\n\nI’ve been watching a lot of older dramas (from 2017, 2018, and 2019) recently, and I am enjoying them. \n\nI don't think I am willing to watch older drama if the CGI is like this, though.\n\nDid you like it? What would you rate it?\n\nThoughts.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1nxbd0i)",

    "content": "While I was skeptical last season and started watching the drama tentatively, I was pretty excited to start season 2!\n\nThis season, our intrepid \"nobodies\" Zhang Chulan and Feng Baobao are on a mission to capture a rogue \"temporary worker,\" Chen Duo, who can poison people just by breathing on them. They are aided by other super powered temporary workers who are distrustful of each other and all have an agenda of their own.\n\n**What I loved:**\n\n* As usual, I adore the hilarious, over-the-top comedy. (Seriously, what is up with the 'dance chhallenge' by Feng Bao Bao. Never mind, it just is, roll with it! That's how things go in this drama lol\n* Yet, this drama can be genuinely profound. I loved its moving message about trust and camaraderie is perfect. The cast absolutely nails the tone.\n* I was sure how the show would end but the story completely subverted my expectations with a surprisingly heartwarming twist.\n* Chen Duo, played by the magnetic Wen Qi, is one of the most compelling characters I've seen.\n\n**One small gripe:**\n\nNear the end, there's a weirdly abrupt info dump that feels disconnected from the show's usual \"show, don't tell\" style. A small very easy to ignore misstep, but it stood out.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nIf you've not watched this urban fantasy drama, you have to. It's really unique and it proves that strong storytelling doesn't need 50+ episodes. Highly, highly recommend.\n\nVerdict: 9/10 - High rewatchability!",

The focus is on the storyline, which makes it refreshing to watch.\n\nIt is currently breaking records and has even achieved the highest heat index among all dramas on Tencent Video in 2025. What makes this even more impressive is that it dropped without any promotions. Zhao Lusi’s outfits, hairstyles, and scenes are also going viral on Chinese social media. People are recreating her moments from the drama, and I have even heard that her outfits are selling out.\n\nAs for the drama itself, this is the first time I have seen Zhao Lusi take on this type of character, and she has been absolutely captivating. I am fully invested and hope the story continues to hold its momentum.\n\nMy only complaint is that the male lead feels a bit underwhelming for such an important role. The chemistry between the leads is also weak so far, and I doubt it will improve much when the characters pull of their mask and become genuine with each other. \n\nThat being said, the female lead and the overall story are entertaining enough to keep me hooked.

Open the Reddit post you want to edit.\n2. Highlight the text you want to mark as a spoiler.\n3. Click on the **exclamation mark in a diamond** located in the top menu of the fancy pants editor.\n4. Click **Save** to save your changes.\n\n# Mobile\n\nTo mark your post as a spoiler:\n\n1. Tap on **Add tags &amp; flair (optional)**.\n2. Scroll down to **Universal tags** and toggle on the slider for **Spoiler**.\n3. Tap on **Apply (**at the top).\n\nTo mark a comment with spoiler tags:\n\nUse this syntax to mark spoilers on mobile: `&gt;!spoiler text!&lt;`\n\nThis will hide the text between the exclamation marks and display the spoiler text when clicked.\n\n# Some guidelines about spoilers:\n\n**DO NOT include spoilers in the post titles**\n\nMake sure that your post title does not have spoilery plot points. For example, posts with titles such as \"Love Show - everyone died!\" or \"Love Show - our main couple finally kissed in episode 20!\" will be instantly removed, regardless of how many comments are under it.\n\n\n\n**DO include the name of the show in the title of the post**\n\nThat said, please don't post overly vague titles. Please ensure that your post title contains the show's name at least. Imagine someone taking a chance to read the post only to be spoiled for a show they didn't want to be spoiled for.\n\nTitles such as \"A review\" or \"The ending of the show\" does not tell you what show is being talked about. Even if they are marked spoilers, they will be removed.\n\n\n\n**Add spoiler tags to spoilery comments**\n\nIf you're discussing a Show's plot point in a post unrelated to the Show, please tag your spoilers with spoiler tags, especially if you're dropping the comment on a post that has nothing to do with the Show. \n\nAlthough I'm generally more lenient with comments with non-spoiler-tagged comments in posts marked as \"spoilers\", comments without spoiler tags under a post that has nothing to do with the show will be removed. \n\n**Posts such as Episode Discussions, discussions about a show's ending must be marked as spoiler or it will be removed.**\n\nWhat it said.\n\n\n\nThat's it! \n\nHappy discussing!",

    "content": "LYST drama explicitly makes Hao Xuan the main villain. But I find it hard to blame him entirely. I think he ended up succeeding because of the mistakes of others.\n\nPrimarily, I blame Jin Cheng. As the protector of both the Moluo Empress and the secret of Ming Yue's existence, he was too unguarded. If I had a protector like him, I'd die pretty quickly too. Not only could an outsider easily leverage his weakness (his kids) against him but he also sold the empress and Moluo clan with an oath on his primordial spirit to tell Hao Xuan whatever he wanted to know.\n\nSecondly, I blame Cang Hai's father. As an emperor of the six realms, knowing the pattern of an evil twin, he allowed evil to brew and mature - enabling the destruction of both Moluo clan and Dixiu clan. It's not like he didn't know that his daughter Ming Yue was going to turn out evil. He knew. And as a emperor of the six realms he let it happen. Worse, he kept it from his successor - the one who is to answer to the six realms after his death.\n\nA very tiny bit of me blame Chu Kong. Just marry the Moluo Empress as the second Prince of Qilin clan and let Hao Xuan suck it up. I mean of course he didn't know that his brother was secretly evil but a lot of their heartache could've been avoided if he became an official consort of the Moluo Empress and also became the clan leader. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1nwtvvh)",

You may post about actors' roles in films or television, their contributions to the industry, and their professional achievements.

Critiques should be constructive and focused on professional aspects and acting techniques rather than personal attacks on an actors' looks, rumours etc. It is fine to critique an actor's performance, but not ok to be derogatory about them.\n\n**What's not OK**\n\n1. Comparing actors' popularity like it's some kind of race to the top.  \n\n2. Treating melon (rumours) like facts, so let's avoid accusing actors of this or that based on unverified melons.\n\n3. Being mean, rude and nasty during discussions. \n\n4. Calling the actors or other celebrities mean names or talk about them in a derogatory way.

    "content": "\n**Synopsis from the iQIYI app:**\n\n**Fated Hearts** is a romance period drama directed by Chu Yuibun (**Ashes of Love, Story of Kunning Palace**), Francis Nam (**Moonlight Mystique**), and Gu Zhiwei (**Story of Kunning Palace**). It stars Li Qin (**War of Faith, Snowy Night Timeless Love, My Dear Guardian**), Chen Zheyuan (**Mr. Bad, Dark Night and Dawn, The White Olive Tree**), Xia Meng (**Youth in the Flames of War**), and Chen Heyi (**Warm on a Cold Night**).\n\nWhen Jinxiu Kingdom is on the brink of defeat in the battle at Pingling, the female archer in red, Fu Yixiao [played by Li Qin], shoots an arrow at Susha's eldest prince, Feng Suige [played by Chen Zheyuan], turning the tide of the battle. \n\nBut Yixiao accidentally falls off a cliff shortly after and loses her memory. After Yixiao is rescued by the Ling family of doctors of the Righteous Villa, she unexpectedly reunites with her old enemy Suige. \n\nLooking at the mess Yixiao is in, Suige infers that it must be related to his predicament in the battle at Pingling. Suige wants to use Yixiao to find out the truth behind the scenes, while Yixiao wants to use Suige to survive under heavy pursuit. \n\nSo the two, who were mortal enemies a month ago, must now rely on each other to survive in the turbulent Yujing City, and &gt;!their love secretly blossoms through countless near-death experiences. The seeds have been sown, and amid the hatred, betrayal, deception, unrequited desire, and inability to let go, everyone is both a player and a pawn.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Yixiao and Suige can only work closely together in the storm to overcome the dark conspiracy, break the shackles of fate, live up to the people's expectations, and not let each other down.!&lt;\n\n[**Trailer**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/s/wRoop7hKbD) \n\n[**MyDramaList link**](https://mydramalist.com/768987-wan-xin-ji)\n\n**Airing on iQIYI**\n\n**Episodes: 40**\n\n#Discussions\n\n🗨️ [All discussions on the drama](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/search/?q=%22Fated+Hearts%22&amp;type=posts&amp;sort=new&amp;cId=ed388974-08c0-4659-8480-165d62bf5676&amp;iId=36c1b4eb-62cf-4f23-a7be-16ea1350fb39) \n\n🗨️ Episodic drama discussions (see the first comment)\n\n#What does r/CDrama think about the show?\n\nLook out for the poll where we ask the sub to rate the drama a week or two after the final airing date! \n\n🗳️ [Results of the poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/search/?q=%22Fated+Hearts%22+how+would+you+rate+it&amp;type=posts&amp;sort=new&amp;cId=821dd550-945a-46eb-b672-ae36b3c7c764&amp;iId=88617dea-2098-42f3-b047-482b61f8a117) (post only appears 1-2 weeks after the drama ends)\n\n#Wiki \n[2024 Drama Index](https://reddit.com/r/CDrama/w/2024-dramas) | [2025 Drama Index](https://reddit.com/r/CDrama/w/2025-dramas)\n",

It does have some similarities to the setup of Netflix's Perfect Match (2025) - comedy where mildly impoverished widow moves to a bigger town to get her daughters married off - but they are quite different beasts.\n\nLiu Lin plays the harassed and put-upon Du Ruyu, whose patience is greatly tried by the quirks and oddities of her daughters - &gt;!her eldest, aged 29 years and 16 months, is picky and materialistic and wants to marry rich; her second, a homebody who *doesn't* want to marry out; her third, an inflexible bookworm; and her fourth, an immature wannabe heroine (i.e. troublemaker).!&lt;\n\nI'm only four episodes in so far, but I am absolutely loving it. The plot is full of hijinks, but the mood is mellow and mild. There's a fair bit of squabbling to drive the interpersonal conflicts, but it feels just like being in a room full of your favourite people - sometimes you get on each other's nerves, but at the end of the day it's all patched up with love.\n\n[This show is making me a big fan of Han Yun Yun \\(R\\) - she handles Jinrong so deftly that the character never tips over from annoying to aggravating, and she has had excellent comic chemistry with pretty much everyone else so far](https://preview.redd.it/4idorfabypsf1.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e43d2c37cbc7b26787a1d2fa6b7afc45ee060ecc)\n\nI mean, they named the main male lead 路不平 (Lu Bu Ping), which translates literally to Uneven (rough) Road. And look at his character introduction! This gentle trolling is exactly how I might describe my siblings. It reminds me of a post I saw recently - [what is your sibling's contact name on your phone](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1nt0rjq/what_is_your_siblings_contact_name_on_your_phone/) \\- read some of the funnier anecdotes and tell me that isn't the same kind of humour!\n\n[Translation: he's a bit of a loser and he's gonna get in his own way more often than not](https://preview.redd.it/7tdof7ewzpsf1.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=094b994a040370619f4d98b38c24106fb00f58f6)\n\nThe opening song 《我想干啥就干啥》is a perfect match (hah) to this easygoing spirit. There's two versions listed in the OST, but my favourite is the one sung by 锤娜丽莎 Chui Na Li Sha, who also appears as a reoccurring minor character. I usually skip openings but I'd gladly sit through this one just to hear it every time. 我想笑了我就笑\\~\n\nThis is a perfect show to unwind with when you're on the hellish commute to/from work, and I would be doing just that *if my phone hadn't manifested the green lines of death* (curse you, Samsung! \\*shakes fist\\*). It hasn't made me belly laugh yet, but each episode has left me with a warm heart and a wide grin, and I am absolutely looking forward to seeing how it will end.",

Some of the sub-genres:\n\n* Poverty Alleviation &amp; Rural Revitalization\n* Infrastructure &amp; Technological Advancement\n* Civil Servant &amp; Grassroots Governance\n* Themed dramas: Dramas commissioned around a specific national theme or anniversary.\n\nSadly (and probably understandably, as it doesn't have international appeal) these dramas are pretty difficult to access for international audiences.\n\nCan you guess which sub-genre these belong to?\n\n**Minning Town:** It tells the true story of the relocation and development of villagers from a barren region in Ningxia to a new settlement.  (Available on Youtube)\n\n**The Long Way Back ( 归队):** Commissioned by the NRTA to commemorate China's 80th anniversary of the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Second World War. The drama revolves around the 14-year struggle against the Japanese invasion of China. (WeTV)\n\n**Like a Flowing River** (大江大河) Series (2018 &amp; 2020) Look at China's \"Reform and Opening Up\" period starting in the late 1970s. It follows three protagonists: a technical expert at a state-owned factory, a former farmer who becomes a village entrepreneur, and an individual business owner.  (Available on Youtube)\n\n**In the Name of the People** (人民的名义) (2017) A groundbreaking drama that took China by storm for its bold (for television) depiction of high-level political corruption. It follows prosecutors and anti-corruption investigators as they take down powerful officials. (Available on Youtube)\n\n**Faith Makes Great (理想照耀中国)** \\- One hundred years since the founding of the Communist Party of China, Faith Makes Great tells stories from different times in history that chronicle the people's endless struggle to realize their dream of rejuvenating the nation.\n\n# Sci-Fi\n\n[Ball lightning: We're waiting so long for this it may actually become a time slip drama....](https://preview.redd.it/gzou51jvdnsf1.jpg?width=675&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a95cda59022fb5f2676c34ccb25824e3fd4aaae)\n\nThese dramas incorporate science-fiction elements into a modern setting.\n\n**Mobius**: Detective Ding Qi (played by Bai Jingting)  accidentally gains a unique supernatural ability: he can relive the same day.\n\n**Three Body**: When scientists around the world starts committing suicide, a quiet scientist is brought in to help the special force set up to investigate the phenomenon.\n\n**Ball Lightning**: (Based on a Liu Ci Xin story. Not aired yet, but it's my hope that it will be soon!) When Chen’s parents are incinerated before his eyes by a blast of ball lightning, he devotes his life to cracking the secret of mysterious natural phenomena. Starring Wang Anyu.\n\n**Reset**: Probably the most popular sci-fi Cdrama in this sub lol. Two passengers trapped in a time loop on a bombed bus work to prevent disaster and find the truth.\n\n# Youth &amp; School (not romance)\n\nI'm excluding the *romantic* high school romance from this one. This genre is about the school system, friendship, personal growth, academic pressure, and the challenges of adolescence.\n\n**The Hope**: Lei Ming, a former successful lecturer facing entrepreneurial setbacks, shifts gears to become a high school teacher. Leading a special class with psychology teacher Sang Xia, they aim to uplift underachieving students.\n\n**She and Her Girls:** Zhang Gui Mei, a female teacher in Huaping County, Yunnan Province, encountered poverty-driven school dropout cases among girls during her home visits. Determined to make a difference, she established a tuition-free all-girls high school with the help of various supporters.\n\n# Medical\n\nDramas set in hospitals, focusing on the lives of doctors, nurses, patients, and medical ethical dilemmas.\n\n**The Heart (关于唐医生的一切):** Centered on a brilliant female cardiac surgeon who leads her team to tackle difficult cases and medical innovations.\n\n**Surgeons (外科风云):** A story about skilled surgeons dealing with professional rivalries, complex cases, and a past medical scandal.\n\n# Legal and Justice\n\nThese dramas revolve around lawyers, court cases, and the pursuit of justice.\n\n**Endless Protection**: Follows the adventures of a juvenile prosecution unit is formed to fight to protect children and combat human evil.\n\n**Draw the Line**: This legal drama depicts the daily work and personal lives of judges as they handle various cases and uphold the law.\n\n**In the name of Justice:** In Haidong Province, prosecutors uncover a false accusation against Zhang Wen Qing while reviewing the “Wan Group Gang Case,” exposing deep corruption among judicial officials. Teaming up with law enforcement and courts, they use whistleblower leads to investigate the “213 Shooting Case.”\n\n# Republican Era\n\n[Overdo \\(not aired yet\\). Y'all want to watch this don't ya? This is a more fantastical depiction of the Republican era, not that we're complainin'](https://preview.redd.it/xe9msjbfensf1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b0099296dca773ff5228937a997fb31b19d279b)\n\nThis genre is set roughly from the 1912 founding of the Republic of China to the 1949 establishment of the People's Republic of China. It's a period marked by immense social upheaval, the clash between tradition and modernity, warlord conflicts, and the War of Resistance against Japan. Dramas from this era often blend **romance, family sagas, suspense, and patriotism**.\n\n**Arsenal Military Academy (烈火军校) (2019):** A woman disguises herself as a man to attend a military academy, leading to a thrilling story of romance, friendship, and patriotism. It has a great mix of action, comedy, and drama.\n\n**City of Streamer (流光之城) (2022):** A sophisticated female spy enters a wealthy household as a tutor to get revenge, but ends up in a dangerous game of love and wits with the family's young heir.\n\n**War of Faith (追风者):** A young banker gets tangled up in corrupt forces of 1930s Shanghai.\n\n**The Disguiser (伪装者) (2015):** A classic and hugely influential drama about three siblings from a prestigious family who are all secretly working undercover for different factions.

    "content": "Well okay, I was supposed to watch Eastern Heretics and Western Venom, and it's thanks to [a review in the sub](https://share.google/GS1cLjwDBTkUtTMhE) I decided to check it out. \n\nI just finished an intense work period and needed something light (aka brainless hehe), so I thought to myself, hey why not just have a look, it's only 15 min. 9 episodes later I am here.\n\nSo it has a The Double-ish premise, the usual revenge/reborn thing. This time it involves a princess who suffers at the hands of her husband who covets her wealth. So, she throws herself off the castle in despair. And as she lay dying she wishes vengeance on the evil people and somehow \"attracted the spirit\" of the just deceased chief of a notorious sect - a ruthless femme fatale who died about the same time.\n\nHer \"twin brother\" (ok kinda not really)  tried to bring her back through a dark ritual but the magic got complicated and she ends up in the princess' body and she ressurects...she no longer has the memories of her former sect leader life. So with her newfound ruthlessness, she goys with her former tormentors like a cat with her prey. It's fun to watch.\n\nAnd our male lead, who had the hots for her (no, really not her sibling so says the comments) decides that since she has no memories it's time to take advantage and get close to her, so he protects her while kinda tries to woo/flirt with her.\n\nNine episodes in and already there are &gt;!poisons, dark magic, drownings, assassinations, black magic, mistresses, adultery, falls of cliffs, kisses, aphrodisiacs and sibling-not-really romance, and the removal of clothes.\n To our ML's credit despite her being doused with a love potion he doesn't take advantage. Dang.!&lt;\n\nIt's deliciously trashy and I am seated. 🤣 \n\nAnd you know what? The quality of this drama - the camera work and acting is better than a lot of long dramas these days. It makes me wonder just why this is so?\n\nAlso, most short dramas have unbearably choppy editing but this one feels pretty smooth.\n\nIt's available on YouTube ✌️ At least for my region.

    "title": "Story of Minglan (ep 40- End) Thoughts (Very Long Warning lol)",
    "content": "Hello! I made a previous post recently about my thoughts on [the Story of Minglan from ep 1-40](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nahv6o/story_of_minglan_thoughts_at_episode_40_long/). And here are the rest of my thoughts for the second half of the drama.\n\n**Overall:** First of all 10/10. This drama really took me through it all lol I was SOOO frustrated at some points and almost rage quit but then they would bring me back in. Overall, I think the story was just very relatable, had universal themes, and portrayed *some* things very realistically. Like overbearing family, evildoers not always getting their karma, injustices going ignored, and the awkward stages of falling in love. In the middle of the drama I at first thought it didn't need to be too long and they could have cut it, but by the end I was wanting more episodes! I wanted to see Molan get more of her karma because sorry did not like how she got away with sending lady Kang to mess with her pregnant sister whose husband was away on duty! Or I would have loved to see more of the full cast together like at the end. It was a very heartwarming scene of them rebuilding the Gu ancestor hall.\n\nI did have some qualms about the final battle episodes and the political intrigue stuff. Like first of all, why did Minglan leave her baby to be guarded by a freaking 8 year old and an old woman lol It worked out in the end but I was like girl you didn't have one more spare warrior to be in the room with them?? Then, secondly why was Minglan like I'll go to the battlefield while everyone hides?? Like girl what were you and Xiatao going to do. Then the long con the emperor and others pulled was interesting; it made for good TV but realistically there were so many ways it could have gone wrong and was risky. Before I get into all the politics I wanted to say that eventually I caught up with everything, but it was kind of hard to keep up with everyone they were throwing at us and all the lore so idk I wish surprisingly maybe those parts were slower because they were kind of background characters that all of a sudden came to the forefront so I had to always circle back and remember which general was which who the prince was and the rest of the imperial gang.\n\nThen, regarding this gang I thought it was so crazy how dumb the noble consort was and how she misjudged the situation. Like at the end of the day the Empress Dowager because of such an important role can do everything including murder and still get more consideration than the average person. So for the consort to stake everything onto this plan with someone who can get away unscathed was a little dumb. Like she could toss you out whenever and she did. The Dowager got away with planning a rebellion, got the noble consort's child, and her whole family executed all because she was an old woman who didn't feel needed or important anymore. In hindsight it's kind of crazy what she got away with due to her reputation. I really think the noble consort misjudged the whole power scale. At the end of the day the emperor is the emperor and he wasn't that unpopular with the people. So to team up with dowager who can get away with anything while you're just a lowly concubine was dumb. I felt a similar way about the Gu family members who kept fawning over the stepmom when Gu Tingye had all the power. What benefits were they getting sucking up to her? Meanwhile Gu had a great reputation, had the title, was head of the household, and favored by the emperor yet they bent over backwards for this woman who to me seemingly had way less power than him. She may have been an elder and more respected but Tingye held all the cards.\n\nFinally, there were parts where I wondered if things were really that bad in the past. Like it had to be an over exaggeration right? I’ve watched other Chinese historical dramas but the way Minglan and others were so restricted seemed over the top. Like Lady Kang had ties to the imperial family from her father, yet she could get away with killing concubines and others, maybe it was because her family covered it but still seemed like an open secret. Meanwhile Minglan has a direct living husband favored by the emperor and she doesn't even dare turn a concubine away. It seemed weird. There were times when it felt like somebody could get stabbed in front of a crowd and in this drama they’d have the one who got stabbed scared that they’d get in trouble for telling or convince themselves to just grin and bear it. **I think that was my biggest gripe with this drama. Justice took too long to come and when it did it wasn’t very satisfying . The good people had to swallow too many slights** A lot of the time the bad people got away with a lot due to reputation or their punishments/ deaths seemed too quick. Like Gu's stepmom met a a terrible end but it bothered me her mask wasn't more publicly exposed. But I guess in actuality this makes it more realistic the fact that the bad guys got away with a lot. Or the more I think of it, I myself come from an immigrant family background and there is a lot of this \"Family helps family\" mindset even if family is terrible. So you know what while not as extreme it is kind of relatable. Like there's that obligation for someone who is doing well to take care of others especially the family in America, you don't \"cut people off\" even at their worst, the oldest siblings are responsible for a lot, and you are ALWAYS considering your reputation so you can brag to other aunties and uncles. So I guess in that way the drama did mirror real life and those societal expectations. I also think the key word of the drama was **contentment** so many characters could have saved themselves grief if they were just CONTENT and lived well. Instead their greed and striving led them to lose everything or to scheme in the worst ways.\n\nAnd thinking back the Noble Consort did help me understand this OBSESSION with reputation. The fact that she and her brother-in-law were the traitors and planned a rebellion yet everyone in her clan had to pay the price was crazy. I better understand now, not excuse it but understand, why people like Minglan's father acted a certain way. In a world where 1 person's actions can get your ENTIRE family killed yeah you'd be a little careful or cautious about your reputation lol. But overall I think despite the injustices and frustrating parts there were even greater parts to this story. Like ugh I feel so empty now without it lol But anyway onto the characters!\n\n**Characters:** First of all.. SHOUTOUT TO THE MVPS!! --&gt; **CHANGBAI, XIATAO, and GRANDMA SHENG** Hands town top tier characters. Not much else to say about them except they were amazing. I've seen alot of historical dramas where the favored maid dies so I was so scared for Xiatao but glad she and the others got their happy endings. She was so loyal and selfless and her child actor was so adorable! Changbai too despite all the privilege had the strongest sense of right and wrong. I loved him because he had truly unwavering character. He applied his morals the same across friends or foes. He saw through facades and supposed good reputations and could see who was a genuine person. I loved when he dealt with the Kang matter and was willing to sacrifice his future because he knew it was right. Or his friendship with Tingye because he saw despite some actions he had a good heart. The Grandma like what else to say. I was about to quit when I thought she was going to die. The depths of her kindness for Minglan and her sense for the family just no words. The drama would not have been the same without her.Just had to praise them first lol\n\nThen, I want to give spotlight to what I think was my favorite storyline. **General Shen and family** Once I understood the whole dynamics I truly saw this story as the most tragic in the show. The fact that the general went away to fight and came back to find his wife killed. He was stuck between a rock and a hard place. He wanted to honor his dead wife, but then had an obligation to his new wife and political pressure. I understand he wanted to do right by his wife's family but it was disgusting how they kept leeching off her sacrifice. At the end of the day the little sister didn't giver her life or her brothers so they need to stop acting like they're owed something by the husband. His wife's little sister the concubine was just so evil. She could have been taken care of in other ways but she chose to serve as a concubine. Then poor Lady Zhang. I CRIED at that scene of her old parents coming to comfort her after childbirth and being there for her. Even though she was an adult you could really see the parental love for her. At the end of the day I couldn't blame anyone in the situation, well except the concubine she was wild glad she got locked up lol But I felt bad for Shen's sister who just felt lost. One second that concubine was her family and in-law and they were happy, then in an instant her sister-in-law is dead and everything has changed. They are in the capital and looked down upon due to their customs. I'm glad it resolved but this truly was such a sad side story for everyone.\n\n**Minglan**\\- Sighh . I really do love her character but her “play dumb” act got old quickly. Sometimes you do have to fight back and I believe Minglan was too passive at some parts . She wanted to avoid conflict but just being harsher in the moment would have saved her grief. Like for the concubine she did accept I feel like it was so unnecessary. They weren't even married a year and people were shoving concubines in her face. I feel like she could have lived freely and done that much to turn her away. Because that same concubine almost ended up killing hers son! That could have been avoided if she just got rid of her earlier. And ugh I would get so frustrated that she didn’t understand Gu!! It was obvious! She kept saying she was so confused but idk why!!! She’s smart . It was obvious Gu wanted her to wear the docile wife facade for the public but open up to him in private. He’s not a traditional guy who cares about rules so I don’t know why Minglan was acting like being the cookie cutter wife would appease him. Anytime she showed her personality he loved it and anytime she was too obedient he acted out, that should have been clue enough for her. I get she has the childhood trauma and it takes time because realistically they would have dealt with this in the dating stage but none of that in a Chinese drama lol straight to marriage. But yeah I don't know why she was being so dense.  Minglan puts that face up for outsiders and Gu swore to protect her and she wouldn’t have to worry. Instead Minglan kept her guard up around him so unconsciously she was showing Gu that she didn’t fully trust him. So I get his frustration, if she can’t fully trust him why even agree to get married??\n\nI’m glad she came around but that was frustrating as heck. I also understood why he was mad at her meeting with Qi Heng. Here she was privately meeting and risking her reputation but for Gu though she had done a lot she still stayed within rules and bounds. So it wasn’t like he thought she would cheat it was in his view her stepping outside the rules/ throwing caution away for someone who wasn’t her husband. Basically Gu kept trying to tell her do you love me for me or out of obligation so me or Gu Tingye the magistrate? Idk why Minglan was so freaking dense about this. I’m not saying she had to be overly affectionate overnight but it would have helped if earlier she just said “I do love you but it will take me time to be more comfortable since I’m used to hiding.” Again she was such a strong character, but there were times I wish she fought back a little bit more to save herself heart ache. But she fought back when it mattered the most like for Tingye and her grandma.\n\n**Gu Tingye:** I used to think sometimes Gu wasn’t that great either for dragging Minglan into things and the his family drama but then I realized they’re very equally matched. Even if she’s married into a peaceful household I feel like the average man at this time would fold or cower in face of a harsh up or leave Minglan to fight alone. At least Gu is right there with her willing to fight for anything . Still Gu made some stupid mistakes. I HATED anything with Man Niang because it seemed like everyone got stupider around her. Like it was obvious she was no good when she went and ruined Gu’a proposal to Minglan’s friend. And then he caught her selling stuff. Instead of watching her , tying her up, or banishing her that night he just said we’ll let you have free reign and be gone tomorrow morning. It just felt dumb considering all he had dealt with and seen in his family. Then when she came back it was so obvious the son wasn’t alive but he let the issue escalate so much. I guess it was the emotions but it was frustrating to watch everyone act like there was any evidence of this kid being alive. I saw a comment that I agreed with. Basically Minglan just saw her try to strangle her own daughter but thought this woman could be reasoned with. So parts of me were mad that Gu led such a reckless life before because that negative reputation did bite him in the butt at times. But at the end I surprisingly thought he was the more mature one between him and Minglan. I think they were equally yoked but realistically could have used more time to get to know each other before marriage.\n\nOh also I guess brief note about Tingye's dad. I kinda wish they had a more proper resolution but I guess that's true to life sometimes. The ambiguity of their relationship was done well. In some ways his dad did care about him, but he was also a very selfish person and not a good one. So there's this moral greyness with him and their relationship. Likewise, Tingye hated him at times and how biased he was, but at the end of the day only wanted his love. Another tragic story.\n\n**Gu family:** So terrible and shameless. They needed help when the brothers were in prison but can’t even muster a sorry towards Gu Tingye and gossip about Minglan. Just disgusting people. The family isn’t even nice to each other but torment Gu who never did anything to harm them. Just vultures praying on weakness then retreating behind the excuse of “we’re family .” Again, I didn't understand this mindset. It showed how entitled they were because just by groveling or flattery they could get more from Gu. Instead while THEY needed help they dare continue to mess with Tingye or demand things get fixed even though they were the ones who did wrong. WORST FAMILY in the series, well tied with Kang I guess.\n\nThen tbh I did not feel bad for the eldest brother in law. He bore such a grudge and hated Tingye without seeing the obvious facts. The stepmom was scheming and the other relatives never cared about him or his family. I wanted him to be more humble at the end and just say sorry. Instead he tried to insist Gu’s suffering and achievements were due to the clan when he did it all on his own. It’s sad that the kindness or morals of people like Minglan or Gu get ignored until someone needs something. So now that you’re dying the same relatives you’ve been plotting with for years can’t be trusted to raise your child or take care of your widow? You dare beg for the same sibling you tortured for years and who never did anything to you.  I did feel bad for his wife and child because he seemed to be a good dad and husband but he also wasn’t a good person. He kept helping the terrible people in his family. And if he had succeeded in harming Gu what was his plan then for his wife and child? Did he think his selfish family members would really help him?\n\nLastly, the stepmom was just so evil. I think that was my biggest issue with the drama. I wanted her to get exposed. She was just so vile hiding behind concern but also blatantly plotting murder and for no good reason! Her only motivation  was that she was so miserable herself, that she was dedicated to sowing discord in her husband's family because he didn't love her. It was honestly enough to pity her. To be that miserable that you can't stand to see someone happy. She was literally fighting a battle with herself because Tingye was never out for her or trying to get ride of her and his 3rd brother. He had a good relationship with his brother and she probably could have gotten anything she wanted. Instead she chose to hate so much and cause her own demise. I love how even her son was like \"Why do you insist on fighting him??\" and she legit had no real answer. I guess the resentment she had truly drove her mad.\n\n**Qi Heng-** I lost respect for him as the show continued. He is someone that doesn’t know hard times. Like during the interrogation he had closer connections than anyone to the rebel prince but didn’t offer to face the same punishment as others. Instead he sat in judgement. He is just so privileged. At first I felt bad for them but he acts in ways without consideration of others because he’s never had to consider others. The whole emperor debacle and political scenes frustrated me because he’s going after the emperor over something so petty. He doesn’t seem to actually do good or help others. It’s just a title to him. Unlike Gu he would never sacrifice his life for somebody else. He was the picture of a spoiled boy. Nice until you deny him something then you’ve wronged him greatly. Like with Gu he hated him but Minglan was never Qi Heng’s alone and Gu gave him ample time to “claim” her if he wanted. He again just thought whatever he wanted would come to him so he didn’t fight for Minglan. BUT I did come around to him at the end and I was happy when he let go of his bitterness and became a true ally to Minglan. Still his character was very childish. He and his wife were cute towards the end but she also annoyed me with her jealousy at first. I'm glad she didn't scheme or act on it but it still was weird because Minglan was a fully married pregnant woman. Realistically what could she do or how was she a threat?\n\n**Sheng Family** **Father-** DEADBEAT. I have never seen a more useless father. He was a true disappointment. But that scene where Minglan schools him and he's left reaching for that game piece did make me tear up. Just the image of an old man realizing the weight of his mistakes was beautiful. Still he was straight trash. The fact that he hit his pregnant daughter Minglan because she was demanding justice for HER GRANDMOTHER, the woman who RAISED HIM when she did not have to. His concern for reputation over family was disgusting. While I understand it, he still sacrificed true peace and harmony for outward appearances. He stood for nothing. At every conflict or at the face of every injustice he chose to run, cover it up, or just sweep it under the rug. I'm glad Minglan could somewhat deal with him by the end but he was a terrible man.\n\n**Big Madam (First Wife, Lady Wang):** You know what at first I viewed her like Rulan. They are a little obnoxious and selfish but they mean no harm. But I hated her by the end. She was truly spineless. The grandma was right that Concubine Lin's antics covered up her own follies. Even though she didn't mean to kill the grandma the fact that after 1 scolding her response was to still POISON an old woman and make her sick was ridiculous. And the grandma was only looking out for her! Even Minglan pointed out her grandchild, Changbai's son, could have easily eaten the poisoned pastry and died or gotten seriously ill. She dragged the whole family down due to selfishness. Because she had no one around to cajole and coddle her she sought out her evil sister and let herself be manipulated. Minglan NEVER caused her any trouble yet with a few words by her sister, the Big Madam thought Minglan was getting too full of herself and would try to take over Big Madam's place. Her character was really ruined for me at the end.\n\n**Rulan**\\- I wish we saw more of her after she got married. Even if it was more of her sisterhood with Minglan or some mini-story about how things were with her husband. I feel like she just vanished.\n\n**Molan**\\- I slightly spoiled her fate for myself because in the middle of watching I looked up what happened to the character because I was so sick of her. And I saw that she lived an unhappy life. So I was just expecting more. I did have mixed emotions at the end. Like I wanted her to get more punishment because at the end of the day she was terrible to Minglan and Rulan for years, KILLED a concubine and her child just like her mom, and whether or not her husband loved her she still got a title and to live in luxury. I kind of wanted her to suffer more. But then at the end when she was with the family I did feel bad and was happy she finally accepted their kindness. At the same time, she knew Kang had evil intentions and let her go free knowing she could hurt Minglan. I didn't like how her role in things never got uncovered. She was another character that you could almost pity for being so miserable. Even her brother pointed it out. She was the wife of a duke (I think?) and still she wasn't happy and striving for more. She was always wanting what others had.\n\n**Wang Family/Kang** \\- Overall most EVIL family right next to Gu. The fact that they so casually talked about covering up murders for Lady Kang was ridiculous. Until the last moment the mom had no remorse for how she raised her daughter. She was willing to bring down her whole family, her in-laws, and herself to save one spoiled child. I'm glad they got their karma. I also didn't understand the mom's logic. She prodded the son to make a name for himself. But the dad's reputation allowed them to literally get away with murder lol To me that seems pretty strong and that it was enough to keep their head down and do well. Instead, the mom wanted to be greedy and align herself with the Dowager. Because of that her son and her family paid a big price.\n\nThen for **Lady Kang**\\- DEMON! I did not expect her to be one of the worst characters. Truly no words. She was just like Stepmom Gu though. So miserable in her own marriage that her resentment just spilled out onto others. If I read the subtitles right, she sold one of the concubine's daughters to her old-aged father-in-law. That's disgusting. Then she was outright killing people. The fact that Minglan serving her the consequences of her actions made her set fire to her house while she was in labor was wild. And she tried to kill the baby! Just terrible human being.\n\nLast one **Random Kang Cousin/Almost Concubine**\\- Idk I just thought this character was so funny because she stabbed or threatened to stab herself like multiple times within the 2 episodes she was featured in. She was freaking crazy lol",

    "content": "Edited to add the preface (because the main body reads like a hate post): I loved this drama so much. Actors were amazing and believable, fight scenes were top notch, my guy Quishui rocks 5 different outfit in every episode (though my another guy Suifeng must love grey and grey only) and the ending was sad but poetic. Even the transmigration plot I critisized in the beginning made much more sense throughout the story. I just can't get enough of this drama, so here I go.\n\nBecause, goddammit, I've been so confused from the beginning of the series. There were so many whys and whens and hows and \"and then???\"s. Characters were in one place and appeared in another moments later. No explanation, no bridge or no carryover. Someone hit by palm strike and left unclear if they're survived or not. People died left and right with no aftermaths. Very important objects appear or disappear like popping candies. Meanwhile, dying guy presents a whole TED talk when everyone can't wait to move on with their day.\n\nBut then, apparently, whoever was responsible for the editing decided that we audiences need some \"tough love\" and cut off all the important scenes that would make complete sense. Like the scene of cooperation and discussion between Quishui and Chenzhou. Or Quishui saved general Wu. I just really don't like this approach that viewers had to use their wildest imagination and do some homework.\n\nIf the producers of Fushanhai see this post, just release those scenes and make us suffer less.",

I was worried about zhang suan becoming the villain cz i reaally liked his character (give me a break from all the 2nd love interest turning into villain trope) but it was good that there was the separate character of Xiao Jingshan. \n\nLets talk about the main characters, i LOVE BaiLu soo much, she's so immortal goddess material i cry. I loved that they made her equally strong as Bai Jiusi and even the final battle was more on her part.\nZeng ShunXi was also great as the heavenly lord. I've been watching his works since the ultimate note but somehow never really got into him until this. This really made me his fan. \nThe onscreen and off screen chemistry between them is soo good i wish we could see them again in a present setting drama. \n\nOverall I'd say i thoroughly enjoyed this show, anyone who still hasn't watched it yet, give it a try!

    "title": "The Maid - can't get over how good this short drama is",
    "content": "Trailer: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTHs7EasvvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTHs7EasvvI)\n\nI'm new to short dramas (tried a few but got distracted/lost interest) but decided to watch this because [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nlqczl/the_maid_2025_is_the_best_short_drama_ive_watched/) praised it.\n\nIt's SO GOOD! \n\nSeriously, if you like costume dramas with super melodramatic plot lines, improbable plot twists paired with good acting, gorgeous costumes (some of the dresses made me go 'huh, is that really accurate?', but I have next to zero knowledge of the historical accuracy and for this type of drama I don't care) and cinematography, decent and tightly written script (could teach a lot of the regular-length cdramas a thing or two) and a gripping story - then go watch this drama. \n\nFirst 8 episodes can be viewed for free on YT (maybe depending on your region): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9razKtFiipE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9razKtFiipE)\n\nI couldn't wait and went to WeTv for a subscription so I could binged the whole thing.\n\n**The premise:**\n\nShen Yuqing (Zhao Xixi) is the mistreated concubine daughter of a powerful general's family, who's forced to take her legitimate sister's Shen Yuanjin (Yang Yunxuan) place on the wedding night to the scary and powerful regent prince Pei Ji (Deng Kai), since her sister has lost her virginity. Falling pregnant, the FL and her concubine mother escapes, but her mom is killed and her newborn child is stolen by her sister. After that Yuqing devotes herself completely to revenge on all those who harmed her. She takes on a new identity, trains as a courtesan and schemes her way into Pei Ji's mansion. Now her plot for revenge can begin...\n\nThe plot is fast-moving and the script gives you just the right amount of information about the characters, with loads of reveals along the way that (for the most part) don't feel out of place.\n\nThe story is melodramatic to an almost ridiculous degree, but to me it felt like watching The Double - there's real emotion at play and all the characters' actions and motivations make sense, while there were a few times were I laughed because of how over-the-top melodramatic and a bit silly it got (also my reaction to The Double) while still finding it highly entertaining and not actual stupid like in a lot of other cdramas (also some more 'serious' ones).\n\nE.g.&gt;! no parent in their right mind would throw a 3-year old out on the street for 'training/teaching him a bout real life'!&lt;. That made me laugh out loud, which I doubt was the drama's intention.\n\n**The actors:**\n\nThe cast was such a treat. With some of the extras and a few side characters (like the Dowager Empress) I do think the lower budget of a short drama showed and some of their acting wasn't that good, but all the main actors seems to have been totally committed and gave it their all. The SFL and SML, the evil stepmother (Zhang Yingbing)- all did great (I even found myself moved by &gt;!the tragic love story of Shen Yuanjin and her lover, despite how absolutely evil she was!&lt;). \n\nAnother highlight was Shen Yuanjin's cousin (Yao Nuo), who was great as the hot, sadistic drug addict &gt;!with hidden trauma!&lt; (and I'm was a bit shocked how&gt;! she was almost openly portrayed as a lesbian who's obsessively attracted to the FL!&lt; \\- maybe that's something you can get away with in a short drama?).\n\nZhao Xixi was fantastic as the FL with the double identity - a great role for her and she performed wonderfully. I got strong Sun Li from Empresses in the Palace from her for some reason. Her chemistry with Deng Kai as the ML was off the charts! \n\nDeng Kai - gotta be honest, half the reason I started watching was for him. I discovered him earlier this year in Love of the Divine Tree, where he ended up being my favorite character apart from the leads, he was so good as a goofy, trying-hard-to-be-a-demonic-overlord-but-failing side character that I was as much invested in his plotline as in anything going on with the CP (and for reference I was *very* invested in that CP). The ML in this drama just fits him perfectly, and he's so good as the morally grey (but hot) prince where you're constantly wondering if &gt;!he's going to kill or kiss the FL !&lt;(sometimes the ML didn't seem to know himself lol). It's nice to get a ML who isn't some super young, baby-faced guy who looks like he got plastic surgery, but instead someone slightly older, more mature and not conventionally handsome (by idol cdrama aesthetics, I basically swooned whenever he swaggered around lol).\n\nThe CP were honestly amazing together, it's one of the more interesting CP dynamics I've watched in a long while. Two hot, scarily smart people &gt;!constantly trying to use each other, but also trying to navigate their feelings of attraction!&lt;. I loved how&gt;! their experiences mirror each other and they eventually recognized each other as soul mates, and you could see from the acting rather than the dialogue (which was deliberately kept vague on this) how and why they gradually fell for each other.!&lt;\n\nFun fact: according to MDL, the two VAs who voice the FL and ML respectively, Jiang Cong and Wei Yifan, are married. Which I'm sure added to how hot and intense the dialogue between the CP is. They both performed well I think.\n\n**Tropes:**\n\n&gt;!A lot of 'ML saves the FL' over and over, but what I liked about it was that it was mostly the FL manipulating the ML into rescuing her, so she became the one in control (most of the time)!&lt;.\n\nAlso some ridiculous &gt;!'cut away from the scene when x character is about to die, then later explain how it all turned out fine because they had a cunning plan'!&lt;. But it was executed well enough that I didn't mind.\n\n**Ending (minor spoiler but no details)**: &gt;!I was convinced it was going to be a sad ending, but it's a happy one.!&lt;\n\n**Detailed ending spoilers (rant):** &gt;!Honestly as sweet as the ending was, it was kind of dumb. There should have been an extra episode to clear everything up. Like how did the ML escape? why didn't he just let the FL in on his plan to fake his own death - it would have been so in character for them both to plan a final, elaborate hoax. And wouldn't it have been better if Pei Ji just took the throne - I know he'd have to kill the young emperor, which he wouldn't do even though since he wouldn't kill a child (although by the drama's own timeline the emperor should have been an young adult man at this point). And I know the FL wanted a safe, peaceful life. But come on, the ML just killed all the remaining generals except one (who's patrolling the border region), the emperor is a dumb kid. Who is going to keep the country together and rule properly if not Pei Ji? This was a little unsatisfying (but I'm happy Pei Ji survived, would be criminal to let a character this hot die, and the FL deserved some happiness).!&lt;\n\n**Final thoughts:** \n\nThis drama really shows the strengths of the short format - it allows for tight storytelling and fast pacing with all unnecessary 'fat' trimmed away, while maintaining a coherent story. I hope it's a success in China that can inspire producers to make similar dramas with this level of quality. And I hope to see Zhao Xixi and Deng Kai get more good, meaty roles, preferably in long-form dramas (Deng Kai has already been in several regular cdramas, but it seems like he's mostly delegated to supporting roles). Both of them are really too good to not get bigger roles.",

Here she is the one coming with a spear in a horse to save the ML; 6- The ML lies to her most of the time, she knows it, she does not blame him, she really does not care for anything as long as he is next to her. \nReally, she is a badass angel!",

    "content": "It is an interesting week but what is worth your time? For viewers who often wonder, ***“What should I watch besides my favorite actor’s latest drama?”*** \\- this ranking guide offers a good starting point. It provides information on highly-watched c-dramas for the week. It also introduces lesser-known but high-quality dramas that are being well-received in China, yet might be flying under the radar for global viewers. Within the top 10, while some shows on the list may feature big-name stars, you’ll also find hidden gems with lesser-known casts that are gaining traction due to strong storytelling and production.\n\nTOP 10 DRAMAS (**Dramas that are airing on both TV/WEB are excluded from the Web List**)\n\n**Bold**\\- New Entry / **Bold +** ***Italics***\\- New No. 1\n\n|RANK|WEB (platforms)|TELEVISION (TV)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|The Journey of Legend (Cheng Yi, Guli Nazha)-costume- 2nd week|***Growing Together S2 (Zhang Jiayi, Chen Hao)- modern comedy - 1st week***|\n|2|Mobius (Bai Jingting, Janice Man)- modern|Wild Ambition Bloom (Rayzha, Tony Yang)- republican|\n|3|**Time Raiders (Francis Ng, Xu Zhenxuan)- modern**|This Thriving Land (Yang Mi, Ou Hao)- republican|\n|4|**Hilarious Family Season 2 (Li Jiaqi, he Saifei)- costume**|The Long Way Back (Hun Jun, Li Naiwen)- republican|\n|5|Moonlit Reunion (Xu Kai, Tian Xi Wei)- costume|Legend of the Female General (ZhouYe, Cheng Lei) costume|\n|6|Shadow Love (Song Yi, Cheng Lei)- costume|Zhen Di (Feng Shaofeng, Li Chen)- republican|\n|7|**Golden Forest (Roger Kwok, Hera Chan)- modern**|**The Guardians (Zhang Yishen, Elvis Han)- republican**|\n|8|Footprints of Change (Tong Yao, Cheng Lei)- republican|Sword Rose (Dilraba, Jin Shijia), modern police|\n|9|**Love's Ambition (Zhao Lusi, William Chan)- modern**|**Hunting (Wang Yang, Zhang Youhao)- modern**|\n|10|Twelve Letters (Zhou Yiran, Wang Yinglu)- modern|Legend of Zang Hai (Xiao Zhan) - costume|\n\n# This Week's Highlights\n\n**What to watch?**\n\n**TV Drama**\n\nI do not have new drama suggestions this week and will stick to suggestions from the previous two weeks where I recommended Growing Together S2 (Zhang Jiayi, Chen Hao)- modern comedy And Wild Ambition Bloom (Rayzha, Tony Yang)- republican\n\n**WEB  Drama**\n\nTitle / Aliases: *Mobius*, *不眠日* (Sleepless Day): “**Mobius**” is a solid pick if you enjoy: Mind-bending mysteries and sci-fi premises, Detective dramas infused with supernatural or speculative elements, Tension, twists, and the “let me rewind and try again” dynamic, Stylish visuals and performances\n\nIt might be less satisfying if you’re looking for: A heavy emotional / romance drama as the central focus, Purely linear storytelling, A more grounded, realistic crime show without fantastical elements\n\nAll in all: worth watching. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel entirely, but it uses the time loop idea in a fresh way, combines it with detective intrigue, and has strong performances to carry you through the more challenging parts.\n\n***Hilarious Family Season 2****: It* starts strong as an *easy, domestic period comedy with stakes* rather than intense melodrama. It leans into humor, quirky family conflict, and expressive acting, which can make it very enjoyable if you’re in the mood for something light but spirited.\n\nIf it sustains its strengths (character chemistry, pacing, balancing humor and drama) and avoids going too heavy or melodramatic, it has the potential to be a solid entry in the costume comedy / light drama space.\n\nRecommendation: If you like period / costume dramas with comedic elements, quirky family politics, and don’t mind some tonal swings, this is worth watching.\n\nIf you prefer heavy emotional arcs, very realistic character psychology, or subtle realism, this may feel a bit too stylized or exaggerated in parts.\n\n***Shadow Love:*** It scores well on expectations for lead chemistry, narrative tension, and production ambition. It has a strong emotional and political setup that gives it potential to be more than just a romance.\n\nWho will likely enjoy it: Fans of “epic romance + war / state conflict” dramas. Viewers who like female generals / strong female leads in historical settings. Those who enjoy romance built with tension, moral dilemmas, identity struggles.\n\nWho might be less satisfied: If you prefer grounded realism over heightened drama / fantasy elements. If you dislike memory / identity plot devices or find them overused. If you prefer tight, small-scale character dramas over multi-thread epics.\n\n\n\n***Ranking Process***\\- This has been designed to be the ''Mother of all rankings''. I am using the average of data across Kuyun, Yunhe, Vlinkage, Douban charts, and Datawin. The mean value is recalculated dynamically for each consultant, for each day, and for every drama, for a period of 7 days.\n\n*For further details, please check: Original post (details about ranking and other notes):* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top\\_10\\_cdramas\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_week\\_32/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top_10_cdramas_for_the_week_week_32/)\n\n",

I've definitely experienced both. That said, ratings can be helpful as a general reference for what others think.\n\nI am sharing this information for folks who are curious about Douban scores but may not be able to access them quickly or easily. I have also included viewership data since Douban scores don't always correlate with a drama's popularity with the broader domestic audience.\n\nThis is just a small snapshot of how Douban users are rating dramas and what’s currently being watched in China.\n\nSome people use ratings to gauge interest while others don't. It's up to them. I'm providing these numbers for those who are interested.\n\nI usually post these every few weeks when there are enough new scores from Douban for a compilation.\n\n***\n\nFor those of you who have watched these dramas, what do you think of the scores?\n\n",

And overall I think Legend of the Female General was my favourite though that first arc of Footprints of Change really came in a close second. That being said, Shadow Love was still enjoyable even with it's campy and chaotic nature.\n\nRole:\n\nI think Cheng Ao (Footprints of Change) just squeaks by with the win for me. He honestly just nailed it in episode 10 during &gt;!the scene that he was calling for dad, the utter heartbreak, getting it together, everything, top notch. I also just enjoyed seeing him go from monster lawyer with a heart of gold to man falling in love.!&lt; That being said, great job Cheng Lei for pulling out 3 characters in Shadow Love!\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/iqxfjzdopbsf1.gif\n\n  \nStyling:  \n\n\nAs someone had mentioned before, the man would still look great in a potato sack, but it was a sad day when we got such minimal Duan Ao Deng screen time because damn.\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/hf20rmmgqbsf1.gif\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/wmqrlemgqbsf1.gif\n\nSpecial shout out to his Fujun era in Legend of the Female General \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/3a2gxw52rbsf1.gif\n\nChemistry:\n\nIt's gotta be Xiao Jue x He Yan (Legend of the Female General)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/dcaq3a7vrbsf1.gif\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5zh06e7vrbsf1.gif\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/3t10ca7vrbsf1.gif\n\nFavourite scenes:\n\nMaybe is recency bias but I just loved this moment in Footprints of Change. it's so sweet and adorable and the way they look at each other\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2wso7wndsbsf1.gif\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9t2wi4odsbsf1.gif\n\nHonorary mentions to the cool action shots in Legend of the Female General:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5wkpnuzpsbsf1.gif\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/r8xuowzpsbsf1.gif\n\nBest kiss:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ws2bkfj2tbsf1.gif\n\nBest Bath Tub Scene:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/2fm6pyq7ubsf1.gif\n\nAnyway, how did you enjoy the Summer of Cheng Lei?\n\n",

    "content": "I finally finished 赴山海 (The Journey to Legend) starring Cheng Yi, and wow… what a wild ride.\n\nThe drama starts off incredibly strong with a transmigration premise — modern protagonist thrown into a wuxia world, mysterious setup, great pacing. But then for about 10 episodes, it gets stuck in a weird 80s wuxia timewarp: endless sect politics, slow pacing, martial arts training arcs… it feels like a TVB rerun from 1989. 🥴\n\nThe silver lining in the early arcs is the subtle danmei-coded “enemies to reluctant allies” dynamic between Liu Suifeng and Xiao Qiushui. Their chemistry is unexpectedly intense and gives the early game some emotional spark. Sadly, Liu Suifeng’s arc fizzles out later, but for a while it really carries the show.\n\nThen around episode 20+, the transmigration plotline finally comes roaring back. Another transmigrator enters the stage, the pacing picks up, and the story gets genuinely interesting again.\n\nWhat truly kept me watching, though, were the support actors and nostalgic Easter eggs: classic Hong Kong legends like Jackie Lui and Julian Cheung, Cheng Yi’s old co-stars, and even the 笑傲江湖 (smiling proud wanderer) theme sneaking in. It’s a C-Drama all-stars wuxia tribute that only veteran fans will fully appreciate.\n\nPersonally, I loved this series as a love letter to the wuxia genre. But realistically, most of today’s C-drama audience won’t get it. The core storytelling is clearly aimed at middle-aged male wuxia fans, while modern Gen Z/Gen Alpha viewers (mostly female) expect xianxia romance and idol aesthetics. The makeup and costumes are styled for a younger female audience, but the heart of the story belongs to 80s wuxia heroes. So it doesn't please anyone in the end. \n\n👉 It’s like writing a love letter to your 80/90s martial arts idol… and let it read aloud from someone born after 2000s. 🫠 ",

    "content": "\nHiii  Just watched The Journey of Legends halfway and I honestly feel so conflicted. I had been looking forward to this drama for such a long time because Cheng Yi is back, and I really wanted to see him shine again. But sadly, the plot just wasn’t it. The storyline was so messy that I lost interest more than once, but I still kept pushing through because I thought maybe it would improve. By episode 20, I finally gave up.\n\nThe biggest issue for me was how poorly explained some of the major events were. For example, they did not even bother to show us properly &gt;!how the male lead’s parents died. One moment they were at the Xiao family’s Sword Mansion, and suddenly they are dead in an entirely different location.!&lt; It felt so random and left me confused. Was it bad writing or just rushed production? I genuinely don’t know, because the acting was solid. The cast gave it their best, but the script wasted all that potential.\n\nYiren’s character was another disappointment. He was built up as someone smart, dependable, and a strong fighter who could even become a sect leader one day. Yet in the actual story, he barely acted with any sense. He ignored his brother, did not make smart decisions, and lost all the traits that the narrative itself praised him for. &gt;!By episode 8 when Tang Rou died,!&lt; I was already frustrated. Still, I continued watching, hoping the plot would surprise me. But it only got worse. By the time I reached episode 20, I honestly asked myself, who is even the “legend” here? At this point it felt more like The Journey to the Deaths of All Legends than any heroic or inspiring journey.\n\nWhat makes me even sadder is that I went into this drama expecting something like The Blood of Youth, which is one of my all-time favorites. That show had everything: a strong and coherent storyline, clever character development, excellent acting, and fight scenes that were exciting and well shot. Even the ending was satisfying. &gt;!Yes, one important character, Tang Lian, died, but they released an extra episode later showing how he actually survived.!&lt; It gave closure and hope, and I love a drama that gives me a happy or at least a meaningful ending.\n\nIn comparison, The Journey of Legends just kept letting me down. No proper storyline, too many unexplained deaths, wasted characters, and no clear sense of direction. I went from being excited to watch it every night to dragging myself through episodes, and eventually I just stopped.\n\nNow I feel so disappointed and honestly a little lost because I don’t even know what to watch next. I had such high hopes for this drama, and instead it left me sad and frustrated. 😔\n\n",

    "content": "The following dramas needs drama hosts! Some confirmed October dramas:\n\n* Fated Hearts (Oct 2)\n* Love in the clouds (Oct 8)\n* Yummy Yummy Yummy (Oct 9)\n\nIf you're interested in hosting, do drop a comment below.\n\nRumoured:\n\n* Blood River - u/Lotus_swimmer is volunteering as she's a big fan of the Blood of Youth, anyone interested in co-hosting do drop a comment below\n\nIf you want to \"book\" as a host for a rumoured drama, drop a comment below.\n\n# Some ground rules for hosts\n\n* Hosts should have watched the drama before writing the particular episodes' discussions\n* Hosts' accounts should not be brand new (1 post karma 0 comments for eg) and have engaged in the sub before by joining some discussions, and are familiar with the sub's rules.\n* Hosts, if possible, should engage in the comments section (don't have to reply to every comment, mind, but participate in the discussion)\n* Write their thoughts about what they watched (we are not going to dictate lengths but please don't just write one sentence and call it a day lol)\n* **Don't add spoilers in the title, and if you are creating a photo post, please spoiler tag it if the picture reveals too much plot.**\n\n# Some awkward situations\n\nIf there's a drama discussion already hosted, and you want to host, please approach the original host to co-host first. Don't try to double post - it'll be awkward for everyone as the mods will defer to the first host.\n\nIf you can't finish hosting the drama let the mods know and we'll automate the discussions\n\n# Co-hosting\n\nWe won't interfere or dictate how to people should co-host, but the simplest way is to agree on schedules - perhaps A can do episodes 1-10 and so on.\n\n# Tips on how to write discussion posts\n\nStructure the discussions the way you want. Some ideas:\n\n* You can group episodes according to arcs and discuss the story arcs\n* You can discuss what happened in selected episodes\n* You can write about your favourite moments in the episodes you discussed\n* You can group episode discussions according to character development\n\n# Express episodes - ending\n\nWe don't expect hosts to pay for express episodes! However, as the mods cannot keep track of every drama's schedule, and if you don't want accidental spoilage, you can inform us to create special express threads for dramas so that you, the host, won't be exposed to spoilers.\n\nWe can also enable automation to funnel posts about the drama's ending to that express thread to ensure no accidental spoilerage in the titles.\n\n# For commenters\n\nDo not discuss future episodes in a thread. For example, discuss plot points for episode 26 in a post about episode 19.\n\nIf you do, please spoiler tag. Those who spoil future episodes will get their comments removed. Hosts, if you see these spoilery comments, feel free to report them.",

    "content": "This will be a short review since I'll be discussing different dramas here\n\n\n**When Destiny Brings the Demon**\n\nOne of my favourite releases this year! I had -19e29393 expectations from it expecially because of the low budget aesthetics, camera quality, sets etc but the story was what I loved the most!\n\n**Story- 8.5/10**\n\nStarted off great but I didn't like the plot I'm the human realm\n\n**Acting- 6/10**\n\nChen Feiyu and Wang Yinglu did a fantastic job, so did the actor who played the antagonist but just 3 people doing a good job acting isn't going to make me give this drama an 8 or 9 in terms of acting.\n\n**Set/camera work/ visuals - 4/10**\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm sure they all worked really hard I just think they didn't have the budget to do it. It's not an issue of skills but the issue of money.\n\n**OST - 7/10**\n\nGood but not memorable\n\n**CGI/animation- 7/10**\n\n**Overall- 8.5** (I didn't average all the scores, this is what I wanna give to the drama since I enjoyed it)\n\n\n--------------\n\n\n\n**Journey of Legend**\n\nknow people are hating on this drama a lot but the hate this drama is getting reminds me of the hate Dilraba gets😭. I also feel like a lot of the hate is coming from antis because half of them would drag down Cheng yi and his looks rather than the drama. That being said the drama definitely isn't flawless either.\n\n**Plot-8/10**\n\nFirst 12 episodes were not the best and as enjoyable as they were the plot was all over the place. But everything after that was chef's kiss. I loveeeeee how the story progressed and the last two episodes had me bawling and crying a new sea and oceans\n\n**Acting- 9/10**\n\nWould've been higher but the script screwed over all the actors in the first 12 episodes. But I'm giving this a 9 because that issue wasn't big enough to hamper with my enjoyment and they all honestly did a phenomenal job after that and overall. Like EVERY SINGLE ACTOR in the cast did absolutely phenomenal job. I don't think I can emphasise enough on how well they did but this is one of the dramas where every single actor were consistently phenomenal. And props to Cheng Yi for playing 3 different characters so perfectly! From their body language to their expressions everything was sooooooo different!\n\n**CGI /ANIMATION-8/10**\n\nFor a high budget drama this should've been higher but again screwed over by the first 12 episodes\n\n**OST-9/10**\n\n**FIGHT SCENES-10/10**\n\nonly thing the drama was consistently good at. I kept replaying these scenes because they were so cool!!!\n\n**SET/ Visuals - 9/10**\n\n**Overall- 8.5/10** (not averaged, just what I think this drama deserves)\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n**Mobius**\n\nPlot-9/10\nI don't think there was a single plot hole and this drama was wonderfully written and super enjoyable!!!\n\n**Acting- 9.5/10**\n\nThis is as good as acting gets. Everyone did a phenomenal job and this is another drama where everyone was consistently good. I did have slight issues with the fl but honestly she did great too. BJT did amazing, some of his actions looked kinda cringe but if I were to pick on that I would be an awfully nitpicky person because I he did fantastic and balance the comedy and serious characteristics of his role so well!!!! And imma be biased and say this, I don't think I've ever seen BJT, Cheng Yi, Liu Yuning, Wang Xingyue and Liu Xueyi ever give a bad performance (yes I added names of my favourite actors, you got any issues with it)\n\n**Ost-7.5/10**\n\n**Action scenes- 8.5/10**\n\nreminds me of Mission Impossible\n\n**SET/ VISUALS -8.5/10**\n\nI haven't been to China but in general I think they look realistic.\n\n**Overall- 9/10** (might be my recency bias but I enjoyed this a lot. Not averaged)",

    "title": "Legend of the Female General",
    "content": "I’m late and rarely post, but I _need_ to yell about this one. This was a top tier drama for me. I’ve never had such intense drama blues 😩\n\nGoing in, I didn’t read the novel, and I don’t watch trailers. All I knew is it starred Cheng Lei, who I was dying to see more of after he outshined the first leads in _MJTY_. I was surprised to see so many people off put by various things, but to each their own. I believe some suspension of belief is required for most dramas, and I didn’t feel like the weaknesses here distracted enough to take away from the strengths. \n\nFor me, the pacing worked well. I didn’t feel like any arc lingered on for too long. I liked almost every scene and side story, and I thought they all contributed meaningfully. It was the perfect mix of plot, romance, and action. I loved the balance of light and dark moments. I loved that there were no dragged out misunderstandings due to a simple miscommunication.\n\nI did think Cheng Li Su looked awkward at times, but I thought it was simply his actor / character, and I did not even realize it was a face swap. Knowing this now doesn’t bother me though. I’m not familiar with the actors, and given the time constraints, it seems fairly well done in my opinion. \n\n‼️ SPOILERS AHEAD ‼️ \n\nI really liked that Xiao Jue openly knew Han Ye was a liar and fell anyway. I think it made their flirtatious scenes even more enticing. I absolutely loved the “10 secrets” dance. “I was once a female general”, “I thought you were going to say ‘will be’”. So. Good. Zhou Ye was so alluring when she said, “I love the moon, but the moon doesn’t know.” I might’ve watched that scene 10 times in a row before moving on. \n\nI truly felt spoiled by all of their scenes. My heart raced every time Xiao Jue asked Han Ye if she liked him. I screamed when he became flustered himself after drawing her eyebrow 😩 I laughed out loud when he ate the noodles and ripped his sleeve. I cried when he told his parents he found the most important person in his life. I could feel the love in his confessions and proposal. My heart soared over and over again. I already miss these two. I’d love to see Cheng Lei and Zhou Ye work together again. \n\nI was fairly certain there’d be a happy ending, but I was on the edge of my seat the whole second half of the show. A sad ending would’ve ruined me. The way Xiao Jue shook as he read the decree shattered my heart. The way they resolutely decided nothing could obstruct their love for one another, which in my book would have been enough of a happy ending, made the actual ending _even better_ and more rewarding. We even got more than one real kiss!\n\nCheng Lei is hands down my favorite actor. He absolutely excels playing this type of character. I don’t usually feel such intense butterflies simply looking at a man 🫠. I could feel every emotion through his expressions. He could tell the whole story through his eyes alone — phenomenal actor. I’m _so_ glad he has more lead roles lined up. I think I’ll always favor Xiao Jue though. This character felt like everything I was dying to see more of after he played Gong Shangjue. I still need to watch Shadow Love (thank god, how else do I move on) !\n\nThis was my first time seeing Zhou Ye, and I liked her a lot. I felt myself falling for her too. I loved how she portrayed this positive, strong, independent woman who at the end of the day could be equally vulnerable — who still wanted to be known, loved, and cared for. I loved her cute demeanor paired with her intelligent, badass energy, and I loved how Xiao Jue could fluster her despite her usual confidence. She was adorable in those moments. I think it’s often tough to balance this kind of character, but she was wonderfully dynamic and did an excellent job conveying each side of He Yan.\n\nI do wish a few things were better. The last three episodes felt a bit rushed and weak compared to the rest. I think most of it could have been solved with a few more episodes to contextualize with deeper backstories. \n\nI was anxiously waiting for Chu Zhao to give into the crazy eyes, and enjoyed the “will he / won’t he do the right thing” energy throughout the show. I was still disappointed when it happened though. I wish his character had a more hopeful ending. It was _very_ satisfying to see He Yan stand her ground though. I loved how fiercely she expressed her feelings of betrayal after having always believed in his good side.\n\nIt was refreshing to see a sensible emperor, but it seemed out of place / silly for his character to be openly moved by and supportive of the CP’s love, and then turned against it so easily. I think the union of two powerful war generals was a sensible threat, especially after having been backstabbed by &gt;!Chancellor Xu!&lt;, but the execution there was done poorly. I do appreciate that he granted He Yan a choice and quickly saw the err in his decisions though. \n\nThe death of &gt;!Ying Xiang, Chu Zhao’s maid!&lt; was incredibly lame. They could’ve at least made it a stab straight through the heart or throat, rather than her shoulder. She’s a skilled fighter after all 😭 \n\nI also saw &gt;!Yan He’s!&lt; death flags waving early on, but I wish they didn’t taunt us like that with him coming all the way back before dying. Are you telling me he couldn’t have gotten medical help before then 😩 I’m willing to look past how plot driven his death was, but I wish his truly tragic storyline had been less rushed in execution. \n\nOverall, this is definitely my favorite drama. If you’ve read all the way to here, thank you so much for coming to my TED talk 🥰",

This is not a complete list of what has aired since July 1, 2025, so feel free to add more in comments!\n\nDramas are ordered according to their first release date.  \nSpoilers are tagged but as per my usual practice, these are not heavy plot spoilers but mostly themes and things you would get to see in the beginning episodes.\n\nPlatforms: 🥝 iQiyi 🐧Tencent/WeTV 👖 Youku\n\n# Completed Drama\n\n**1.** [**Justifiable Defense**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1lvj4f3/justifiable_defense_%E6%AD%A3%E5%BD%93%E9%98%B2%E5%8D%AB_2025_what_are_your_first/) **正当防卫** 🥝  \n📺15 Episodes  \n🔖Douban Score: 6.0  \n💬[Episode Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1lox82p/comment/n2p8gyr/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n**✏Mini Review**  \nFor a drama in the legal &amp; crime suspense genre, I must say that the suspense definitely kept me going (as well as the fact that there were only 15 episodes so the time investment wasn't much), but the legal, crime investigation and procedurals aspects were quite subpar. Some of the events or reasons for characters behavior also required a degree of suspension of logic, especially towards the latter half of the drama.\n\nAll-in-all, you might enjoy this (and here's a [rather positive review](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1lx5eig/is_anyone_watching_justifiable_defence/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) from another user in the sub) if you are fans of the lead(s) and also appreciate a more curated and atmospheric suspense drama.\n\n✅ Atmospheric and moody tone with an introspective and stylized narrative  \n✅ A strong sense of suspense that kept me guessing with a couple of unexpected twists  \n✅ Notable themes such as guilt, redemption, family-of-origin trauma, school bullying, and the exploration of \"Justifiable Defence\"  \n✅ Zhang Lu Yi (as Prosecutor Duan) stands out with a solid performance where he showcased different phases of the character as a younger prosecutor, a more seasoned prosecutor and a \"wronged prosecutor\"\n\n⭕ The rain-heavy aesthetic felt overdone and became visually monotonous and forced than natural  \n⭕ Quite a few plot points felt illogical and hard to be taken seriously: for eg, police asked for help from divers at a local aquarium when they needed to search and retrieve a phone underwater *and* they did not take note of the divers' identities  \n⭕ Dialogue often feels overly theatrical and unnatural\n\n⭕ This drama successfully made me dislike all the characters (so maybe that's a plus)…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcwa3tgda7sf1.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edf8546cb31e05d9dfa7af46719ef638857b644d\n\n**2.** [**Narcotic Operation**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1lybjg1/the_narcotic_operation_%E6%89%AB%E6%AF%92%E9%A3%8E%E6%9A%B4_2025_what_are_your/) **扫毒风暴** 🐧  \n📺33 Episodes  \n🔖Douban Score: 7.5  \n💬[Episode Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1m0nrf1/the_narcotic_operation_discussion_episode_13/)\n\n**✏Mini Review**  \nA striking, cinematic and hard-hitting crime thriller, *Narcotic Operation* turned out to be quite a mix-bag of good and bad with some notable inconsistencies. With a star-studded cast and a multi-threaded storyline, it set up intrigue quickly in the earlier episodes which helped to pull me into the world and staying until the end.\n\n✅ Cinematic quality and bold direction with a strong visual presentation and a film-like shooting and editing style  \n✅ Refreshing narrative with minimal exposition as the director relies more on visual storytelling than lengthy dialogue  \n✅ Chemistry and tension between the lead actors and antagonists Qin Hao and Duan Yihong provided quite a few memorable scenes. Strong supporting cast from other veterans.\n\n⭕ The almost constant handheld shaky cam can either make or break the experience for you and might cause physical discomfort if you have motion sickness. I had to pause between episodes and move to a smaller screen to decrease the dizziness I was getting.  \n⭕ Too many characters and too many plotlines can make the story a bit difficult to get into especially in the earlier episodes. I couldn't really remember who's who especially on the \"bad guys\" side of things and had to refer to the official[ character chart ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1lxrr0b/comment/n2oee4v/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)😅.  \n⭕ Plot and logical integrity started to fall off a bit in the latter portion of the drama, and towards the end some of the narrative felt rather rushed and driven more by convenience than coherence.\n\n⭕ I felt that the main police character could have been given more depth if filmed in a more grounded and realistic way. The character himself was meant to be suffering from past trauma and acting a bit unhinged, but it felt quite jarring and in a bad way because (I think) the overall aesthetic of the drama made him feel quite superficial and unreal.  \n⭕ I also felt that there was an overuse of irrelevant or mood-clashing music that actually cheapened the emotional impact of some scenes. It also felt like the drama was over-reliant on using music to create or heighten the mood, which made some of the scenes feel like a music video (MV) -- which isn't particularly the vibe that I am looking for in a crime drama.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hl8tgxnfa7sf1.png?width=1116&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8031978f34a4109d4c093282a2bc1e5399e7f565\n\n**3.** [**Beloved**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mzfdod/beloved_%E7%9B%AE%E4%B9%8B%E6%89%80%E5%8F%8A_from_iqiyi_airing_on_august_28_2025/) **目之所及** 🥝  \n📺16 Episodes  \n🔖Douban Score: 6.8\n\n**✏Mini Review**  \niQiyi's Light On cinema has not had many (or any?) good suspense dramas in quite a while, and **Beloved** definitely felt like a good entry for 2025 thus far. It's got a decent suspense story with decent twists and turns, does a good job at resolving plot holes by later episodes, and provides the main leads proper depth and room to amaze with their acting skills. Seriously, I would probably watch this just for FL Wang Ziwen and FL's mother character played by Chen Jin -- they played the younger and older version of the FL in [The Three Body](https://mydramalist.com/63487-the-three-body-problem) and they are both spectacular in this.\n\n[Welcome to the romance drama in this list :D](https://preview.redd.it/5jkw1z75c7sf1.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f96e173a88d8f0735edb15726a1cc2e8f7d12d40)\n\n[Or perhaps \\\\\"Why you should not marry your high school sweetheart\\\\\" 😂](https://preview.redd.it/p1egpuvbc7sf1.png?width=1414&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21f6f43c8fe9f67b34d3c355cd41ea7b8ea6928c)\n\n✅ The male and female leads are well developed, with their relationship driving the story in a believable way, and with a romance plot that was handled delicately and actually felt natural and moving.  \n✅ Flashbacks and high school scenes are well-placed, adding context without feeling excessive.  \n✅ FL Wang Ziwen’s emotional acting, especially her crying scenes, is definitely a highlight. In fact, I think this drama can be retitled as \"100 Ways to Cry\".  \n✅ ML Luo Jin is also great in his role. I can't comment much as that will be too spoilery, so you just have to trust me -- he doesn't appear much until episdoe 5 and 6.  \n✅ Certain scenes, like&gt;! the mother–daughter standoff and their car !&lt;scene, deliver real dramatic tension.  \n✅ Supporting character Fu Wenjiang is unexpectedly entertaining, switching accents depending on the situation he's in and adding unexpected humor.  \n✅ Interesting exploration of mother-daughter relationships, with nearly every mother shaping their children’s&gt;! tragic!&lt; paths in different &gt;!controlling, paranoid, or biased!&lt; ways.\n\n[With a full cast of gloomy supporting characters 😉 \\(p.s.

As most of these were shown in the earlier episodes, this also made the show feel unnatural and overly heavy.  \n⭕ A few too many characters tend to act in extreme ways, which made the story feel less grounded and realistic.  \n⭕ Period settings (1980s, 1990s, early 2000s) were not over distinctive, with makeup and styling that didn't seem to differ that much across the decades. While I liked the FL's clothing it didn't really fell like it's from the early 2000s, same with the furnishing at the FL's apartment.  \n⭕ The subplot about the female detective felt unnecessary, wasn't adequately explored, and didn't add much of anything to the rest of the story.  \n⭕ The last 4 episodes felt a bit draggy at times, but the performances of the cast made it easier to overlook. The ending &gt;!was well worth the journey :)!&lt;\n\n**4.** [**Mobius**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nj4cqg/mobius_%E4%B8%8D%E7%9C%A0%E6%97%A5_2025_what_are_your_first_impressions/) **不眠日** 🥝  \n📺16 Episodes  \n🔖Douban Score: 7.5  \n[💬Episode Discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nmo7lz/mobius_episodes_1216_express_episodesend/)\n\n✏ **Mini Review**  \nThe drama features an intriguing time-loop setting where&gt;! the entire world repeats five times, yet only certain individuals retain their memories, allowing them to alter events with that knowledge!&lt;. Filmed in a blockbuster style, it offered definite strengths and weaknesses that largely depend on your taste for this type of story. For me, while the premise and pacing (especially in the later half) delivered thrills, the overall storytelling and character portrayals came across as somewhat superficial. At times, it also felt floaty and deliberately mysterious without real substance.\n\n✅ A fresh concept for a cdrama, with plenty of hooks and twists in each episode  \n✅ Strong action scenes that keep the energy high  \n✅ Tight pacing without excessive filler  \n✅ Music fit the atmosphere well, though it was occasionally overused and overpowering\n\n⭕ Many side characters lacked depth, particularly those on the “good side.” They felt one-dimensional and seemed to exist mainly so the male lead wouldn’t appear as a lone hero.  \n⭕ The male lead had an excess of spotlight moments. Even &gt;!when an armored police squad was deployed and in action, he had to rush to the front to take down armed robbers with a handgun himself!&lt;.  \n⭕ The romance arc often fell flat and failed to resonate  \n⭕ The plot left some unanswered questions though I won't call them exactly plot-holes, just felt that some of the plot events were more driven by convenience than solid logic.  \n⭕ The police felt quite useless (except the ML and by extension, his team), but then again that (\"useless police\") 's almost becoming a trope in this genre...  \n⭕ Personally I didn't form any sort of emotional attachment to any of the characters. This is a dire contrast to the other drama \"**Beloved**\" above where my attachment to the characters was the main driver that kept me watching.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1pdhuiuc7sf1.png?width=1633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f27ebbad61f310bba35667219938edc31d11d8ec\n\n# Dropped Dramas\n\n**1.** [**Sword Rose**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mbnl3y/sword_rose_%E5%88%A9%E5%89%91%E7%8E%AB%E7%91%B0_2025_what_are_your_first/) **利剑玫瑰** 🥝🐧  \n📺32 Episodes  \n🔖Douban Score: 6.9\n\n**Impressions**  \n✅ Drama explores the rarely seen (on screen) subject of anti–human trafficking, which gives it much real-life significance and emotional moments  \n✅ Good pacing which kept the story moving  \n✅ Overall good visuals and a comfy filter that felt suitable for the grounded story  \n⭕ I found some of the emotional scenes sudden and overacted (mostly from the supporting actors)  \n⭕ The leads were decent in their roles, though I wasn't particularly drawn to the FL's backstory. This is partly on me though as I felt I have watched quite a few \"lead(s) with a relevant past\" stories recently in this genre 😅\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d80ggfxwc7sf1.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a171a38e7c081f18c99f6094d52e58a984ad3a17\n\n**2.** [**Beneath the Undertow**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1me6fb5/beneath_the_undertow_%E6%9A%97%E6%BD%AE%E7%BC%89%E5%87%B6_2025_what_are_your/) **暗潮缉凶** 🥝  \n📺19 Episodes  \n🔖Douban Score: 7.0\n\n**Impressions**  \n✅ Performances were strong, with the actors bringing depth and realism to their roles  \n✅ The setting, props, and dialogue had a lived-in quality that felt grounded and true to life  \n✅ The investigation process felt convincing. The police were shown to analyzing evidence and suspects step by step rather than having some unrealistic \"main character\" foresight. Each clue shifted their deductions in a reasonable way and suspicions were confirmed or ruled out logically.\n\n⭕ Too many suspects!! And with the drama going into depth to explore the backstory of each of them, the plot felt scattered, the suspense was weakened and I started to lose interest...  \n⭕ The finale was apparently hugely &gt;!unsatisfying!&lt;. The resolution relied on &gt;!implausible twists that made much of the earlier investigation feel irrelevant , so be warned!&lt; if you decide to pick this up.  \n⭕ Lastly, and this is not specific to this drama, but the dynamic of an older cop mentoring a younger one felt overused and predictable, and the impulsive rookie (who inevitably gets into trouble) isn't that amicable anymore (if ever).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vtzxqzuzc7sf1.png?width=1638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59438a12ef5fa857efd63a5b9da810f943d28913\n\n**3.** [**Double Track Puzzle**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1n8yk88/double_track_puzzle_%E9%BB%91%E7%99%BD%E5%B1%80_2025_what_are_your_first/) **黑白局** 👖  \n📺20 Episodes  \n🔖Douban Score: 6.0\n\n**Impressions**  \nI don't have much to write here as I didn't watch past episode 2. It felt like a decent drama if you are a fan of the anti-theft and anti-drug sub-genre, and/or a fan of the male lead Yang Xuwen, who was the lead in **Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty**. The beginning setting on a passenger train did remind me a lot of Watch Your Back, which was an anti-theft drama set in the same period. There were also quite a few characters introduced at the beginning, though none were particularly memorable. I mainly dropped it because it wasn't particularly interesting for me, and I wasn't in the mood for this sub-genre.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xeknle12d7sf1.png?width=825&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5728471c35869e60c348520f27c99bc5f8b6ca24\n\n**4.** [**Hunting**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1np4v5t/hunting_%E5%9B%B4%E7%8C%8E_from_iqiyi_and_tencent_airing_tomorrow/) **围猎** 🥝🐧  \n📺 24 Episodes  \n🔖 Douban Score: TBA\n\n**Impressions**  \nFollowing on from my first impressions of this drama shared in the [Masterpost](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nqfph2/comment/ng8ns0r/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button), it seems like the most of the flaws mentioned there did end up making this drama less than what it could have become. I would consider it as still a good candidate for a casual view.\n\n✅ The dad character, played by Yang Haoyu, was a standout. He completely disappeared into the role, portraying a gambler who hasn’t entirely lost his conscience. His mix of street smarts, slyness, and clear love for his son made the character more layered than just the usual \"gambler &amp; abusive father\" persona. ✅ Zhang Youhao gave a pretty decent and realistic performance as the son, bringing a grounded energy to the screen even if the role itself felt overly righteous and stiff at times.  \n✅ Certain moments carried strong tension and intrigue, showing the story’s potential when it found the right rhythm.\n\n⭕ The romance subplot between the son and female lead felt out of place. I felt their scenes were a chore to get through, and often clashed with the main tone.  \n⭕ It didn't help the cause when the female lead’s character came off as reckless and unconvincing for someone in an anti-narcotics unit. Her constant solo actions and colleagues cleaning up her mess also undermined the team’s credibility.  \n⭕The use of a painfully fake greenscreen night sky in the romance arc was distracting and made me question the drama's production quality.  \n⭕ Overall, the drama alternated between interesting-and-tense and draggy-and-dull, making the viewing experience quite uneven.\n\n[\\(Collage made by u\\/admelioremvitam\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gkg82dy4d7sf1.png?width=1224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a6212ba0d46ccb12be93bdbd554c76980028242)\n\n**5.** [**Justice is Mine**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nswxep/justice_is_mine_%E7%BB%9D%E5%91%BD%E6%B3%95%E5%AE%98_2025_what_are_your_first/) **绝命法官** 👖  \n📺 20 Episodes  \n🔖 Douban Score: TBA\n\n**Impressions**  \nOnly watched the first few episodes of this one and currently I feel that the plot &gt; character portrayals. It's great to see Nick Cheung in a drama setting again but I don't feel particularly empathetic towards the judge/father character (and definitely not the son). I understand that he was supposed to be a righteous and fair judge who's gathered a lot of respect, trust and loyalty from his fellow colleagues in law enforcement, and I think the portrayal could have been better. The suspense and tension is definitely present to keep the viewer hooked. And I do suggest watching the Cantonese version if you can find it (as the drama is only released regionally). Note that this is a remake of the Israeli drama [Your Honor/Kvodo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7181728/), and there are several other regional remakes of this if you are interested in seeing how this story has been adapted to different localized versions.\n\n[\\(Collage made by u\\/admelioremvitam\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4c6blfvad7sf1.png?width=1333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ec144d5df65eaca26b9e9a4005a9ecb6a477d67)\n\n# Questions\n\n1.

They also released a new behind-the-scenes special featuring [Nie Xi](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%81%82%E6%9B%A6/3451775) played by Vision Wei Chen. I stitched the two clips together for this post. The transition point is at 2:16.\n\nThe airing schedule will be posted in the comments when it is available.\n\nClip descriptions:\n\nTrailer: *He is “Donghai,” but “Donghai” is also the countless many like him. Wu Shi chose to go deep undercover, to bring the war to an earlier end; while his comrades faced death without fear, to keep the spark of faith alive. The long night nears its end, only because there were those willing to be the very first guides.*\n\nBehind-the-scenes special: *Nie Xi is Wu Shi’s sharpest blade, and also the most loyal star in the dark night. Played by Vision Wei Chen, Nie Xi vividly embodies that unwavering conviction of “even if opposed by countless others, I will still go forward.” Tune in to witness the bond between master and disciple in turbulent times, the life-and-death trust in dire straits, and look forward to this soul-stirring performance.*\n\n\n***\n\n* Episodes: 40\n* Streaming platform: iQiyi 🥝 and CCTV-8 🐑\n* Official filming time period: January 26, 2024 to May 27, 2024\n* Filming location: Xiamen \n\n***\n\n* Producer: Yu Hewei\n* Director: [Yang Yazhou](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9D%A8%E4%BA%9A%E6%B4%B2/3485) (Cross Mountains and Seas, Cao Mao Jing Cha, Hey Daddy, Wings)\n* Screenwriter: [Lu Min](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8D%A2%E6%95%8F/64005192) (A Ba Yi Jia Ren)\n\n***\n\n🔗 [Previous trailer, poster, etc.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/search/?q=%22An+Ye+Shen+Hai+%E6%9A%97%E5%A4%9C%E6%B7%B1%E6%B5%B7%22&amp;type=posts&amp;sort=new&amp;cId=f922772c-a82a-4c10-85cd-7e3a938a1476&amp;iId=a2df76db-f43c-48ad-ae3f-995927d37808) \n\n\n***\n\n[Synopsis from MDL (with minor additions and links)](https://mydramalist.com/761679-shen-hai-1950):\n\nIn August 1949,  [Wu Shi](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%90%B4%E7%9F%B3/3771447) [played by Yu Hewei], who was supposed to welcome the liberation in Fuzhou, was suddenly appointed by Chiang Kai-shek [played by Ma Xiaowei] as the Deputy Minister of National Defense of the National Government.\n\nIn order to obtain more intelligence, Wu Shi resolutely went to Taiwan to take office according to the instructions of the party organization and used his work convenience to provide the East China Bureau of the Communist Party of China with important information, such as the changes in the troop strength on [Kinmen Island](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinmen) and the mobilization of the national army in the Southwest Campaign.\n\n[Zhu Feng](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9C%B1%E6%9E%AB/14561) [played by Wu Yue] was originally going to return to Shanghai, but he learned that Wu Shi's original courier had died and the organization needed to send a new courier to Taiwan, so he resolutely gave up the opportunity to reunite with his family and went to Taiwan alone.

    "content": "So I’m watching War of Faith and I absolutely love it. It’s the only other republican era drama I’ve liked since I watched Arsenal Military academy(this was before i even knew what cdramas were).\n\nI love the storytelling, all the characters(the good and not so good ones), the B(romance) between the two leads(hehe, their chemistry was insane), and most of all, I liked that it made me think. I spent about 2 hours learning about Jianshi region in China and the Long March. It’s been a while since I’ve watched something that really made me pause to go research key details. The propaganda is a little on the nose, but it was really eye opening to see the perspective of the CCP from a financial lens. I loved Wang Yibo’s portrayal of Wen Ruolai. His chemistry with the main casts and supporting casts was actually really good! I loved how we slowly delve into the crossroads of his primary aspiration ( a country where even the poorest person can have a pathway to success) and communism, as well as how he comes into the intersection of his dreams and the rising movement of the CCP during that era. It was a huge perspective change for me.\n\nWith that being said, I have had to pause it indefinitely for now😭. The stakes were getting higher in the story and I was getting stressed out!! I kept imagining different scenarios and thinking of all the bad things that could happen to the characters, I just had to pause. I was like wait, what if I just stop for now and come back when I’m feeling a little lighter about the storyline and can actually enjoy it as a 3rd party and not someone in 1930s china.\n\nHave you ever experienced something similar where you had to pause a drama till you were in the right frame of mind of continue? If so, which drama was it and why did you have to pause. Did you ever pick it back up?",

    "content": "I know this drama is kinda old 👵🏻 but I just started it today for funsies because it stars both Ren Jia Lun and Tang Song Yun. I’m a recent fan of Jia Lun after watching The Demon Hunter’s Romance, One and Only, and Forever and Ever in that order in the last month. I’ve liked Tang Song Yun since watching The Sword and the Brocade when it aired lol \n\nI have to say though that the voice dubbing is throwing me off a bit 😭 Trying to get used to it and not think about it too much but once you know the actors’ voices, it’s pretty rough pretending that whatever the dub sounds like is what they sound like lmao \n\nThe ratings on Viki and MDL for it are pretty good so I’ll keep going. Currently mid-way through episode 1 so have a ways to go! \n\nCurious what others thought about it! It’s kind of interesting seeing Ren Jia Lun have a bit of villain aura, if you will, at the start lol ",

    "title": "The Legendary Life of Queen Lau - cute, relaxing costume romcom",
    "content": "For those watching Hilarious Family (season 2 currently airing) and enjoying Jackie Li/Li Jiaqi, give The Legendary Life of Queen Lau\\* a try!\n\nIt's a pretty low-budget, cute romcom where you shouldn't think too hard about the plot and setting (ancient fictional kingdom with weird mix of modern day equipment and some Japanese details to the costumes), but just enjoy the funny moments and sweet romance.\n\nJackie Li is the FL and Li Hongyi is the ML, and while I'd never watched either of them in anything before, they both shine as ball-of-sunshine country bumpkin who marries tsundere and bratty immature emperor (he's supposed to be 20, but acts more like a teen).\n\nBai Shu is the SML, and being a fan it's nice to see him get a proper role - he's not really a serious love rival, but more like a comic relief, and as always he's really funny.\n\nI didn't know the rest of the cast, but so far (20 episodes in), they are all cute and funny, and the side couples are rather endearing (unlike so often in romcoms where the side couples are super boring).\n\n**Premise**: Duan Yunzhang (Li Hongyi) has come of age and needs to marry an empress to be allowed to take full power from the grand chancellor Liu Xie, who controls the army and has been the defacto ruler since the previous emperor died while the ML was still a child. The emperor hates and fears the grand chancellor, whom he sees as tyrant, as Liu Xie can basically do whatever he wants because he controls the army.\n\nLiu Xie decrees that the emperor must marry Liu Xie's daughter - who turns out to be an uncultured girl named Liu Jinfeng (Jackie Li), who's been tucked away for years in a remote village, estranged from her father whom she views as an evil schemer. Jinfeng has for years had a penpal relationship with 'Xuan Lang', who she believes she has been engaged to from a young age. \n\nWhen Jinfeng shows up in the capital to finally meet her future husband, her father gleefully marries her to the emperor without telling either of them who they're actually marrying (the ML thinks he's marrying the dainty, refined and highly culture second daughter of Liu Xie). \n\nThe result is a sort of comedy of errors, where Jinfeng and Yunzhang are both gradually pushed to grow up (and grow out of their preconceived ideas of romance), and gradually fall in love along the way.\n\nThe first couple of episodes are a bit weird and jarring - ep 1 made me really confused about what was going on and irritated with the FL, who seemed very brainless and annoyingly crude, because she acted like a love-struck fool for the ML. While the ML seemed pretty mean (although his character's motives were more understandable). \n\nHowever, already in ep 2 I started to warm to the FL - Jackie Li is an atypical FL, being short and chubby (although not with supermodel looks, I do thinks she's quite pretty in a down-to-earth kind of way, and having characters say mean things about her looks in ep 1-2 annoyed me - fortunately it's brief and the FL herself has high self-esteem and brushes it off). But her smile is to die for - she's basically one of the cutest FL actresses I've seen so far, because she comes off as naturally sweet, kind and cheerful. On top of that, the FL is portrayed as a fairly smart, down-to-earth person who likes to have fun, don't hold grudges and always makes the best out of every situation.\n\nIt's really nice with an FL who is shown to be resourceful without being over-the-top brilliant and good at everything she does. It felt more realistic, especially given her background where she had obviously learned real life skills - and of course growing up in a poor village means that she doesn't know about literature and higher education, but has very good practical skills.\n\nThe ML seems mean and unlikable at first, but the script does develop him into a likable character. Li Hongyi's portrayal is very endearing and made me laugh a lot - the ML is basically a tsundere, super arrogant (understandable since he's the emperor), and a bit of a pretentious idiot, but in a lovable way. His falling in love with the FL felt very natural and realistic, because a) the FL is the most adorable cinnamon roll with a talent for making people have fun, and b) the ML and FL share lots of genuine interactions (so nice to see in a romance drama instead of FL and ML only falling in love because the other person is hot and the script demands it) and gradually build rapport. They also share some goofy traits (&gt;!their romantic dreams about each other !&lt;are very funny) that made me buy their romance, since despite their different upbringings they do have quite a lot in common.\n\nDon't expect any steamy scenes - in 20 episodes there's been 1 real kiss so far (which was so unintentionally bad I literally had to look away from the screen), but still, the chemistry between the leads is obvious in a sort of innocent teen romance way, and to me at least it feels a lot more believable and genuine than in so many of the dramas where the leads do have lots of kissing and skinship.\n\nThe pacing and editing is kind of weird at times, there are a lot of 'don't think too hard about the logic' moments, and you do have to go in to this drama expecting something fairly brainless to enjoy it. Most of the time it's also not laugh out loud funny, but I still found it entertaining and every episode so far has made me chuckle. The cuteness is abundant and I'm not watching for the plot, but just because of how lovable the characters are and how fun the CP is when they're together. \n\nIn short, it's a good drama if you need something relaxing and sweet between more plot-heavy or angsty dramas.\n\nThe drama is on Viki and Youtube.\n\nMDL link: [https://mydramalist.com/685283-the-legendary-life-of-queen-lau](https://mydramalist.com/685283-the-legendary-life-of-queen-lau)\n\n\\*I have no idea why the English title calls the FL 'Queen Lau' when her last name is Liu.",

Now, my knowledge of Chinese history is close to Nil and my source is Wikipedia. Feel free to correct me if I am wrong. \n\nThe original material by Wen Ruian is loosely set during the Reign of [Emperor Gaozong of Song Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozong_of_Song). It is a time of turbulence and instability. Daxi lost the Northen half of its territory to Jurchen/Machus (Jin dynasty). Narrowly avoiding capture, The Emperor fled, re-establishing his capital and court in the southern half of the land.  Slowly, Song military commanders including [Yue Fei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Fei) reconquered portions of central plains the while court officials (including [Qin Hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Hui)) managed the civil bureaucracy.\n\n**In Go to the Mountains &amp; Seas,** The unnamed Emperor is most likely a representation of Emperor Gaozong of Song while the Famed General Wu, a fictional General Yue Fei. \n\nAt the recommendation of court advisors such as Qin Hui, Emperor Gaozong pursue peace with the warring Jurchen resulting in the [Treaty of Shaoxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Shaoxing), ceding the Central Plains and formally established Song as a tributary state to Jin dynasty. It ensured two decades of uninterrupted peace, allowing the Southern Song state to achieve internal stability and open a lucrative trade with Jin. Furthermore, it served to preclude the return of Emperor Qinzong, his half-brother and legitimate successor to the throne who remained in captivity with the Jins and whose release could have jeopardized Gaozong's claim to the throne. Emperor Gaozong and Qin Hui then secured court control over the military, forcing generals into retirement and executing Yue Fei on trumped-up charges. Despite his successes as emperor, Gaozong's treatment of Yue (who is considered widely by the populace as a national hero), and his surrender of over half of Song China to the enemy, marred his reputation.\n\n**Putting this in the perspective of Fu shan hai,** perhaps all along, the emperor has been encouraging all the tragedy happening. As an Emperor, he would rather allow traitors in court and invading nation in the country. Historically, continuing the war is too expensive and conceding in defeat can be argued to be the wiser choice. However, in Go to the Mountains &amp; Seas, they solve this issue by finding the treasure hidden within the Hero Token. Just like history, Is he afraid were General Wu successful in reclaiming Song's land, his legitimacy to the throne would be questioned?\n\nIt is disgusting how many chivalrous souls are needed to make up for One person's cowardice and One person's evil? \n\nNot having read the original source material, If I were to make a guess, The waterway King Zhu would be  Qin hui who schemed to have the general captured and executed. However, Li nan/ Kaiyan happily took over that role and was even offered the title Imperial advisor upon success. \n\n\n\n**Wulin Mengzhu/Alliance leader**\n\nI really appreciate their interpretation of Wulin Mengzhu. Usually the title of Alliance leader is bestow upon the greatest martial artist after a competition and normally a drama would center around how they use some cool trick technique to defeat a predecessor. \n\nI think we can all appreciate that even after all the buffs up, Xiao Qiushui is far from being the strongest in Wulin. Both Li Chenzhou and Crazy Yan are far stronger. But that's not being a leader. A leader should inspire trust and rally the people together against invaders.\n\n[All of them setting their difference aside and coming to back Qiushui ](https://preview.redd.it/q1jpvd6ditrf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=015bd01c7f57656b5af809b2010097945cbbd482)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnlpfl4kitrf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a0d3270a33c8b887d9a3dddf83c8a10038322b2\n\n**Li Nan/Kaiyan**\n\nThe case of Li Nan and Kaiyan is an interesting one. It might shred some light on how to see Xiao Ming ming/ Xiao Qiushui. Although Li Nan claimed to be the same person as Kaiyan, in the early instances, they obviously are not the same entity. Before the murders, Kaiyan expressed reluctance and care for his family. Emotionally, he is on a different level as Li Nan. In later episodes/time frame, Li Nan stopped reappearing as a separate entity and more more of his viciousness is incorporated in Kaiyan's personality.  \n\n \n\n[Ep 14, Kaiyan stopped friends to assist Qiushui. ](https://preview.redd.it/qajbii5cjtrf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b50ed5a73a2411ea4c10eeafeae9254e0f87319)\n\n[...Are they trying to Parody the Triangular Stabs too?](https://preview.redd.it/cwro7lxxltrf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6376d6c0922d5c93d42ca2512f912fdaa80f1666)\n\n[Kaiyan, knowing the original story dooms him, set out to carve himself new possibilities at the expense of the country](https://preview.redd.it/jyb8b4e2mtrf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa30df9d2c62433f06383a66fea48e83d52e5bed)\n\n\n\n**Li Chenzhou**\n\n[The only one in that lot that got himself a wife. ](https://preview.redd.it/9gw8j80omtrf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a66158465793dec2d8b9fa8a5deaec8d3786351)\n\n[Dog Food](https://preview.redd.it/qvnbym7entrf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e995eee3dcd9588381eec314b8b6e8851186f91)\n\n[Being fed Dog food](https://preview.redd.it/0ek0uwppntrf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b85d5a3e53babcdcbd7626dff07d5a185589afd7)\n\n[Join the Power family?](https://preview.redd.it/uj4xh8btntrf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=959d88769e22517c09c44607e75e0b4a7e4548f7)\n\n\n\nIn the end, I think Xiao Qiushui/Xiao MingMing contrasts Xiao Kaiyan/Li Nan. I can understand Xiao Kaiyan's desperation to carve himself another ending from the original novel but there are many other options for him. When he walked the path of murder and treason, it is on his greed and jealousy. \n\nAs for Xiao Qiushui, deep down, he probably knows his end but walked that path anyway because it is the right thing to do and what the country needed.\n\n\n\nEveryone! This is the last Fushanhai Discussion! Thank you for joining in! Thank you Everyone! \n\n*Resetting out*",

The triad boss seeks revenge for his son, unleashing a bloody storm. Policewoman Tong Hin, however, remains steadfast in upholding justice, relentlessly pursuing the truth.\n\n***\n\n[More details translated from 南方都市报 Nanfang Dushi Bao](https://m.mp.oeeee.com/oe/BAAFRD0000202409271004306.html):\n\n^(Please note that the character names are translated to the typical spelling for Cantonese names.)\n\nAfter a 20-year hiatus from television dramas, Nick Cheung reunites with Myolie Wu, a decade-long friendship now taking center stage, joining forces with rising actor Joseph Zeng to form the \"new golden trio\" of **Justice Is Mine**.\n\nIn the series:\n\n* Nick Cheung plays Chun Yu, a conflicted character torn between his professional identity and family obligations.  \n* Myolie Wu portrays Tong Hin, a principled police officer grappling with moral dilemmas as darkness encroaches.  \n* Joseph Zeng takes on the role of Hon Lit, a young man forced to suppress his edge for self-preservation – but can he hold onto his convictions as power shifts around him?  \n\nThree complex characters, three distinct acting styles, and three seemingly divergent audience demographics converge in this bold experiment. The creative team aims to break boundaries, crafting a new era of Hong Kong dramas with the broadest possible appeal.  \n\nNotably, mainland actor Joseph Zeng, a native of Shenzhen, Guangdong, naturally exudes a \"Hong Kong vibe,\" seamlessly blending into the Hong Kong drama market. This casting combination is seen as a promising formula for breaking down drama viewing barriers under the new Hong Kong drama model.  \n\n**Justice is Mine** delves into the tangled conflicts of human nature and the struggle for justice. Through its intricate plot and multi-dimensional characters, the series immerses viewers in an investigative journey, uncovering both the righteous and darker sides of humanity.  \n\nA unique aspect of the drama is its use of the audience’s perspective as an entry point, sparking discussion and prompting reflection: Is human nature truly just black and white? Can the law fully encompass moral boundaries? And when societal roles clash with familial duties, what choice is the right one?  \n\nWith enigmatic cases, deeply layered characterizations, and tightly interwoven narratives, the series explores the complexities of human decisions at a profound level. It aims to resonate with audiences while opening new possibilities for deeper integration between Hong Kong and mainland Chinese television.  \n\n[Baidu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%8D%E7%8B%97%E4%B9%8B%E8%A1%80/64946817) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37014251/) | [MDL](https://mydramalist.com/776187-chu-gou-zhi-xue)\n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses I share in the \"trailers &amp; posters\" posts are based on the original Chinese sources (Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

Patient after patient, along with the families behind them, looked to the doctors and nurses to join forces and save live. Ideals and reality clashed constantly; helplessness and warmth often coexisted.

These recordings will then be synced with the movement of the characters' lips.\n\nIt is not uncommon to find the actor you see on screen has been dubbed over by a different voice actor; however, sometimes it is the original actor themself that has taken the responsibility of dubbing their character.\n\n# Original Soundtracks\n\nThe impact that a drama's soundtrack can have on the viewing experience is not something to be overlooked.\n\nA good soundtrack can take an average drama from good to great, and elevate a great drama from impactful to unforgettable.\n\nSomething that I did not realise when I started my C-drama journey is that many character themes are brought to life via the respective actors.\n\n# An Example\n\nThere are many dramas to use as examples; I am going to use two songs from [*The Untamed*](https://mydramalist.com/28723-the-untamed) as examples for this post.\n\n[Xiao Zhan](https://mydramalist.com/people/13346-xiao-zhan)'s character [Wei Wu Xian / Wei Ying](https://mydramalist.com/character/wei-wu-xian-wei-ying) has a dedicated theme titled [Qu Jin Chen Qing (曲尽陈情)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21cAlGgZ_W8). Xiao Zhan sings this song himself.\n\n[Wang Yi Bo](https://mydramalist.com/people/13735-wang-yi-bo)'s character [Lan Wang Ji / Lan Zhan](https://mydramalist.com/character/lan-wang-ji-lan-zhan) also has a character song titled [Bu Wang (不忘)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkIpTb8WThw). Similar to Xiao Zhan, Wang Yibo also sings his character's theme himself.\n\nNow, I actually did not realise this while I was watching the drama because Wei Wuxian and Lan Wang Ji are not voiced by Xiao Zhang and Wang Yibo.\n\n**Disclaimer:** *I am not complaining. I think the drama was perfect, and I cannot imagine the voice of the Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation as anyone other than* [*Lu Zhi Xing*](https://mydramalist.com/people/55821-lu-zhi-xing) *(the voice actor who brought Wei Wuxian to life).*\n\n# Fangs of Fortune | 大梦归离\n\n**Two Extra Disclaimers:**\n\n* I am not comparing the two dramas, *The Untamed* and *Fangs of Fortune. I would not want to change a thing about either drama.*\n* *I am not claiming that Fangs of Fortune is the only, or even the first, drama to take the approach I am about to discuss. I am merely mentioning that the drama stood out to me, and it was the first time I actually paid proper attention to an OST.*\n\nWhat *Fangs of Fortune* did was that they kept the original actors for both the visual and audio representation of the characters on screen.\n\nNote, this is not true for every character; voice actors such as [Duan Yi Xuan](https://mydramalist.com/people/140405-duan-yi-xuan), [Shi Ze Kun](https://mydramalist.com/people/147424-shi-ze-kun), [Zhu Rong Rong](https://mydramalist.com/people/146908-zhu-rong-rong), and [Zhang Jia Hui](https://mydramalist.com/people/147984-zhang-jia-hui) were involved in the creation of the drama, but all the characters with their own character songs were voiced by the same individuals we see on screen.\n\nThe video I have included above includes two character songs.\n\nThe first song is titled [半我 (Half of Me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNXHn2k2kVI&amp;list=RDYNXHn2k2kVI&amp;start_radio=1). It is the theme for Cheng Xiao and Lai Weiming's characters, the sister and brother duo Pei Si Jing and Pei Si Heng. The song represents the two characters, and is also sung by the two \"characters\".\n\nThe second song is titled [英雄不磊落 (Heroes Are Upright)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrjSHIHr46A&amp;list=PLLaG0k-PXfnd2jSwSUgGt28IU7_zzHRdH&amp;index=11). This song represents [Xu Zhen Xuan](https://mydramalist.com/people/121895-xu-zhen-xuan)'s character Ying Lei. The song is also sung by Xu Zhen Xuan, thereby giving life to the \"character\" in the song.\n\nThe entire OST for Fangs of Fortune is filled with many more examples like the two I have mentioned above. The most notable of which is [小诗句 (Little Verses)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrM9iohaGXk&amp;list=PLLaG0k-PXfnd2jSwSUgGt28IU7_zzHRdH&amp;index=13) \\- the song that was played at the end of each episode. Little Verses features the majority of the main cast and has an upbeat melody. This is in contrast to the show's sometimes dark atmosphere.\n\n# Why Fangs of Fortune?\n\nAs I stated in one of my many disclaimers in this post, Fangs of Fortune is by no means the only drama that has taken the above-mentioned approach when it comes to dubbing and OST. So, why am I using it as an example?\n\nWell, it's simply my favourite OST, and the more I thought about why this OST resonates with me so much, the more I realised that it's because the music keeps the characters alive in my heart. Even without watching the drama, I feel like I am still in that world, and as someone who loves that world, I'm glad I have my favourite characters accompanying me on my way to work.\n\nI hope more dramas take this approach in the future because I think it adds to the longevity of a story in the audience's minds and hearts.\n",

But I’m starting to think the reason why I’m obsessed with this drama is cos I’m envious of the FL, cos my girl is so relatable!! \n\nI have liked a lot of cdrama female leads, the strong ones, the scheming ones, the funny ones, etc, but this is my first time liking a lazy one, and that’s because if I were in her shoes, I would do exactly the same thing she did. Imagine being randomly transported to a whole new universe you don’t know shit about, and next thing you are shipped off to serve this grandmaster that kills people randomly. Girl..I would lay tf low, and if the opportunity arises, grab the most powerful person’s thigh (who happens to be a gorgeous grandmaster, hellooo?!) and just see the whole ordeal as a vacation, and not take shit seriously, which is what the FL did. \n\nI sometimes see some comments saying, why is she not trying to be more powerful? And I’m just like…Are y’all not tired of working? Do y’all hate fun? After suffering as a corporate drone for years, y’all want her to go through the same slugging in a fantasy world, I know I wouldn’t. Good luck to those that would though. My girl is unapologetically lazy, a foodie and a sleepaholic..so fun and relatable. \n\nAnyways, just for funsies, if you randomly transmigrated into the world of your favourite fantasy Chinese drama, what would you do? Level up to become more powerful for the heck of it, tow the righteous route and try to save the world or just hug the biggest thigh and slack off? \n\n",

Bonus if the love triangle involves two women and one man and also if the story doesn’t magically turn the second lead into a villain.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is when the second male lead is completely focused on the female lead, while the second female lead, who genuinely cares, gets overlooked.😮‍💨 And also, sometimes, it feels like that the two male leads just get together instead of fighting over her.\n\nRant over.

    "title": "Thoughts and Questions I have about Bloody Romance",
    "content": "Best part about this show is that all the female characters are BADDIES!!!!!! My fav scene was how every girl that's part of Guihua city rose up when they were under attack. They may hate each other but that will always be a place they protect and call home. \n\nAlthough it was a pretty good watch, I did notice quite a few plotholes throughout. \n\n* The obvious one was towards the end— Prince needed the snake vine to heal himself, and as Yueying went to look for it... suddenly the show cuts to a scene where Prince and Wanmei get up and suddenly find it???\n* Chaluo didn't know who assassinated her in the beginning, but towards the end she somehow found out/framed it on Chang'an out of nowhere. And the FL was like yea.\n\n**Chaluo:** Didn't expect myself to say this but she's one of my fav villains!!!!! She's unapologetically bad and her evil mannerisms + expressions are ON TOP. Ofc her evilness isn't likeable but her arrogance, style, and Jill Hsu's acting made her the star of the show for me. Xingfeng was a relatively good guy who didn't want her to keep sinning and their love story is bittersweet. \n\n**Wanmei:** I can see why people say they don't like the FL for her lack of killing as an assassin... but imo her strength lies in seeing the human, the story, the grievances, in EVERY person around her. She doesn't ever give up on her morals or promises as she rises to the top. Love her for that and love how she pushes herself to become stronger and stand up for good. \n\n**Chang'an:** I like his character a lot and absolutely love how he is so loyal and sacrificial towards Wanmei, but his storyline falls FLAT. His whole plan with Ruanning was pretty much all talk but no action (I can understand bc irl the Tang dynasty never got revived and the wordless edict was inconclusive too) UNTIL the end... but he leaves his 10,000 army to save Wanmei?? I like seeing how selfless he was but his character could've been more intricate and interesting. \n\n**Prince:** He seems more like the ML of the show to me. I find it impressive of how he plans out almost EVERYTHING. From using Wanmei to lead to the downfall of Blood Lotus Cult, teaching her sword and other tactics, making her stronger by stirring up the marital arts world/wulin as well as witnessing Yingying's death so she can defeat Chaluo, using her to start a battle with Yue Qingya, setting Liuguang against Chaluo, the list goes on. Yue Ying is right when she says, \"Prince, I don't know when you are acting and when you are not.\"\n\n**Wanxiang:** The start of the show set her up as the major enemy against Wanmei, but after the scene where she killed her mother, she pretty much disappeared from the plot. (From that point on it would've been more fascinating to see her collaborate with Wanmei possibly.) Wanxiang is pretty interesting but imo the script didn't fully flesh out her character.\n\n1. What is Lan He's role in Blood Lotus Cult and Guihua City? Was she the leader of both? And was she killed by Yue Qingya or no? I remember Prince talking about how she married Yue Qingya first and then the past emperor (not shown).\n2. I found the revelation that Prince being Yue Qingya's son to be very surprising?? And how did the FL figure that out?\n3. Who do you ship Wanmei more with (Chang'an or Prince)? I love how Chang'an protects her no matter what and would spend time with her but I have to say Prince's mysterious charisma and vibe reallyyy draw me in.\n4. I find the emperor's role in this drama kind of odd. He seems to be out-of-touch (such as being unaware of Yue Qingya using the entire army to attack Guihua City). I'm surprised he became emperor in the first place, as he also doesn't have much agency. In most shows, the emperor plays a very important role, but I guess not in this one. What do you think?\n5. So I guess Chang'an did not die in the end? I didn't understand the poem but it hints that he is hidden in another city. Does anyone who read the novel know if Wanmei found out eventually? ",

As a rogue cultivator with ruined spiritual roots, he had to be ruthless to others and even more so to himself just to avoid being trampled upon. He braved the perilous Thousand Abyss Ancient Tomb seven times, explored the Dead Sea's secret realms eight times, and survived countless near-deaths before finally ascending to the realm of Nascent Soul Great Power.\n\nJust as he reached the pinnacle of his life, the apocalypse loomed. Song Qianji scoured ancient texts and fought through secret realms, ultimately finding a treasure capable of saving the world. But no one believed him – not even his beloved, who betrayed him on the battlefield. Cornered and hopeless, he self-destructed and died.\n\nIn this current life, Song Qianji is reborn and vows to live as a “salted fish” 咸鱼 (a slacker with no ambition). Yet the rare opportunities he longed for in his past life now come uninvited. He rejects the generous recruitment from sects, refuses to become a disciple of the Three Saints, and severs all emotional ties with his former beloved. All he wants is to “lie flat” (slack off), farm peacefully, and live a happy life.\n\nBut when the immortal sects exploit the people and chaos reigns, how can this one man stay out of it? &gt;!Sects covet him, the Heaven-Pillar Tree withers, and a mysterious demonic healer emerges. Someone must wield the sword of justice to vanquish demons and protect the innocent. Especially when he has friends and confidants willing to follow him through life and death.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Even if it costs his life to uphold the Dao 道, the mortal world is worth fighting for.!&lt;\n\n[Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/35736156/)\n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses I share in the \"trailers &amp; posters\" posts are based on the original Chinese sources (Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

    "content": "On the one hand, I do love the fact that they ended happily ever. But on the other hand, I felt as of Jin'an's transition to Duan Aodeng then back to Jian'an + Duan Aodeng less than satisfying for some reason.  \n\nI think the biggest problem for me was that the logic didn't work out very well for me- So, Aodeng got reimplanted with the Jade thingy. But what about the  blood pact thing? Also, I couldn't imagine Aodeng is the sort of person who would leave his brother who is now very vulnerable - paralysed and with his life tied to that dowager empress. A corrupted official could easily just take over by killing the woman. \n\nI can buy Li Shuang leaving though - I feel that she left her brother in a good position, though he too, is quite vulnerable. \n\nThe other day I saw a comment on xiaohongshu - the poster said she wished it was a tragic ending as it would make more sense and at least she'll get moved by the pathos. Not for me though - I think a happy ending is still possible, but I feel like they really brushed over Duan Aodeng's resolution and ignored major parts about his character. Also, I'd have loved that he was more Aodeng than Jin'an at the ending. It almost felt as if Aodeng disappeared and Jin'an took over completely. That way, I felt that their transition to a pastoral life is more solid.\n\nI feel that it's more true to Aodeng and may to an extent, Li Shuang's characters if they were watching over their kingdoms like secret guardians ... while leading a pastoral life. ;)\n\n  \nWhat do you think?",

An unexpected pregnancy, a broken engagement, and mounting gossip throw the village into a frenzy – and Fan Yan into the center of it all.\n\nAmid shifting alliances, eager matchmakers, and quiet tensions, Fan Yan must help Xiao Fang find a way forward. But as she digs deeper, Fan Yan begins to uncover tangled secrets that bind the villagers together in ways she never imagined.\n\n(Source: MyDramaList)\n\n~~ Adapted from the web novel \"Xiao Fang Chu Jia\" (小芳出嫁) by Yi Bei (伊北). \n\n***\n\n[Synopsis translated from the drama’s filming and production record](https://mydramalist.com/photos/JB2e0X_3): \n\nOn the eve of the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), the Yang family was faced with a thorny problem: Yang Fanhu’s daughter, Yang Xiaofang, had fallen in love with a young man from the same village named Xiaowei and unexpectedly became pregnant. Though neither of Xiaofang’s aunts had planned to return home for the holiday, they rushed back upon hearing the news, offering ideas and support for Xiaofang’s upcoming marriage.\n\nHowever, before the wedding could take place, the two families quarreled over the bride price and parted on bad terms, putting the wedding plans on hold. As Xiaofang’s pregnancy progressed, the Yang family elders grew increasingly anxious about her and the unborn child’s future.\n\nSurprisingly, after news of Xiaofang’s breakup spread, matchmakers began showing up at the door. The single men nearby (her hometown) didn’t seem to mind that she was pregnant. Events took an unexpected turn.\n\n&gt;!But Xiaofang held a pure and idealistic view of love and could not accept a marriage without it. Despite her family’s objections, she chose to raise the child on her own and threw herself into developing the local herbal medicine industry - resolutely becoming a truly modern, independent woman.!&lt;\n\n[Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/36946810/)\n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses I share in the \"trailers &amp; posters\" posts are based on the original Chinese sources (Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

With the help of her supposed twin brother Xiao Ren, she embarks on a ruthless quest for revenge, uncovering forbidden secrets and deadly power struggles along the way.\n\n(Source: TMDb) \\[[MDL](https://mydramalist.com/778814-jin-zhao-yu-zui)\\]\n\n**NETWORK**\n\nThis time **Bilibili** is taking the helm!\n\nWhy does that matter? Of the internationally available short dramas, **Bilibili** is putting out some quality content. What have they produced?\n\n1. Echoes of the Self (Ongoing)\n2. Lumonisity Behind the Palace\n3. Qingchuan's Veil of Vengeance\n4. Ban Xing Fu Sheng\n5. Link Click\n6. The Future Handbook\n7. An Ancient Love Song\n8. Delicacies Destiny\n9. Song of Life\n10. Couple of Mirrors\n\nPersonally, I'm here for the **BiliBili** Originals. Ratio wise I've been satisfied more often than any other network. By what metrics? Quality acting, character driven stories, moving and engaging plots, produced well for budget, nice nod to cinematography.\n\n**DIRECTOR**\n\nXi Zi 喜子 is a Chinese director, known for the currently ongoing **Twin Fates,** **Grab Your Love,** and the ever so controversial **Love and Bid Farewell.**\n\nWhy does this matter? If you've watched or heard about the last drama mentioned, you know a couple of taboo topics occur in it. It's a very important distinction, and it's not a spoiler that the ML is a black flag.\n\nI'm an easily triggered and overly sensitive person. However, I *deeply appreciated* many aspects of this drama. **Love and Bid Farewell** is not a romance, it's an allegory.\n\nI felt the director did not romanticize the romance or the descent into hell. Yet he still managed to express the profund beauty of sorrow in parting and grief. His use of cinematography to capture trauma metaphors was magnifcent. *The only true beauty was release.*\n\nBack to the real point - this gives me hope that with Xi Zi directing, **Gemini** might be a pretty cool drama!\n\n**NOW, DOES ANYONE HAVE A LINK TO WHERE IT'S SUBBED IN ENGLISH?** 💀",

The triad boss seeks revenge for his son, unleashing a bloody storm. Policewoman Tong Hin, however, remains steadfast in upholding justice, relentlessly pursuing the truth.\n\n***\n\n[More details translated from 南方都市报 Nanfang Dushi Bao](https://m.mp.oeeee.com/oe/BAAFRD0000202409271004306.html):\n\n^(Please note that the character names are translated to the typical spelling for Cantonese names.)\n\nAfter a 20-year hiatus from television dramas, Nick Cheung reunites with Myolie Wu, a decade-long friendship now taking center stage, joining forces with rising actor Joseph Zeng to form the \"new golden trio\" of **Justice Is Mine**.\n\nIn the series:\n\n* Nick Cheung plays Chun Yu, a conflicted character torn between his professional identity and family obligations.  \n* Myolie Wu portrays Tong Hin, a principled police officer grappling with moral dilemmas as darkness encroaches.  \n* Joseph Zeng takes on the role of Hon Lit, a young man forced to suppress his edge for self-preservation – but can he hold onto his convictions as power shifts around him?  \n\nThree complex characters, three distinct acting styles, and three seemingly divergent audience demographics converge in this bold experiment. The creative team aims to break boundaries, crafting a new era of Hong Kong dramas with the broadest possible appeal.  \n\nNotably, mainland actor Joseph Zeng, a native of Shenzhen, Guangdong, naturally exudes a \"Hong Kong vibe,\" seamlessly blending into the Hong Kong drama market. This casting combination is seen as a promising formula for breaking down drama viewing barriers under the new Hong Kong drama model.  \n\n**Justice is Mine** delves into the tangled conflicts of human nature and the struggle for justice. Through its intricate plot and multi-dimensional characters, the series immerses viewers in an investigative journey, uncovering both the righteous and darker sides of humanity.  \n\nA unique aspect of the drama is its use of the audience’s perspective as an entry point, sparking discussion and prompting reflection: Is human nature truly just black and white? Can the law fully encompass moral boundaries? And when societal roles clash with familial duties, what choice is the right one?  \n\nWith enigmatic cases, deeply layered characterizations, and tightly interwoven narratives, the series explores the complexities of human decisions at a profound level. It aims to resonate with audiences while opening new possibilities for deeper integration between Hong Kong and mainland Chinese television.  \n\n[Baidu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%8D%E7%8B%97%E4%B9%8B%E8%A1%80/64946817) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37014251/) | [MDL](https://mydramalist.com/776187-chu-gou-zhi-xue)\n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses I share in the \"trailers &amp; posters\" posts are based on the original Chinese sources (Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

    "content": "As we have new members joining all the time, and as we *still* get reports about spoilery posts, I think a weekly reminder about the importance of marking your posts with spoilers tags is in order.\n\nIf your post or comments contains discussions of major plot points (*especially about deaths and endings*), mark your post with spoiler tags or it will be removed. Here's how you do it.\n\n# On the Desktop\n\nThis will work in Fancy Pants Editor mode, so switch to the mode by clicking on the “Switch to Fancy Pants Editor” button located at the top right corner of the text box.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9xb5ht42p3bc1.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43820119f41012eff0d33a811c7a1bbcb0ae9ab9\n\nTo mark your **entire post** as spoiler-y:\n\n1. At the bottom of the Fancy pants editor, click **+Spoiler**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgtt3rohp3bc1.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71e2c6a02fa6f7a902f3c320db9466bdb6851694\n\n**Note:** Your post will now have the symbol **Spoiler** next to the title. \n\nTo mark content on the text of your post body using the Fancy pants editor:\n\n1. Open the Reddit post you want to edit.\n2. Highlight the text you want to mark as a spoiler.\n3. Click on the **exclamation mark in a diamond** located in the top menu of the fancy pants editor.\n4. Click **Save** to save your changes.\n\n# Mobile\n\nTo mark your post as a spoiler:\n\n1. Tap on **Add tags &amp; flair (optional)**.\n2. Scroll down to **Universal tags** and toggle on the slider for **Spoiler**.\n3. Tap on **Apply (**at the top).\n\nTo mark a comment with spoiler tags:\n\nUse this syntax to mark spoilers on mobile: `&gt;!spoiler text!&lt;`\n\nThis will hide the text between the exclamation marks and display the spoiler text when clicked.\n\n# Some guidelines about spoilers:\n\n**DO NOT include spoilers in the post titles**\n\nMake sure that your post title does not have spoilery plot points. For example, posts with titles such as \"Love Show - everyone died!\" or \"Love Show - our main couple finally kissed in episode 20!\" will be instantly removed, regardless of how many comments are under it.\n\n\n\n**DO include the name of the show in the title of the post**\n\nThat said, please don't post overly vague titles. Please ensure that your post title contains the show's name at least. Imagine someone taking a chance to read the post only to be spoiled for a show they didn't want to be spoiled for.\n\nTitles such as \"A review\" or \"The ending of the show\" does not tell you what show is being talked about. Even if they are marked spoilers, they will be removed.\n\n\n\n**Add spoiler tags to spoilery comments**\n\nIf you're discussing a Show's plot point in a post unrelated to the Show, please tag your spoilers with spoiler tags, especially if you're dropping the comment on a post that has nothing to do with the Show. \n\nAlthough I'm generally more lenient with comments with non-spoiler-tagged comments in posts marked as \"spoilers\", comments without spoiler tags under a post that has nothing to do with the show will be removed. \n\n**Posts such as Episode Discussions, discussions about a show's ending must be marked as spoiler or it will be removed.**\n\nWhat it said.\n\n\n\nThat's it! \n\nHappy discussing!",

    "title": "Moderators' note about Yu Menglong and on discussing celebrity deaths",
    "content": "This is going to be a long one, so brace yourself!\n\n**TL;DR:** Out of respect for Yu Menglong, his family, and our community, we are not allowing speculation or conspiracy theories about his death.\n\nInvestigations take time—police and medical teams don’t release every detail right away, and families have the right to privacy. Criticism of police in China should stay respectful, since we’re commenting from our own limited perspective and don’t fully understand the cultural or legal context. History has shown that online gossip can spiral out of control and cause real harm.\n\nIn this sub, we will be removing comments that speculate about his death. Users who continue to do so despite warnings will be given temp bans. Let’s focus instead on honoring Yu Menglong’s life, his work, and the impact he had on all of us.\n\n\\---\n\nWe know many are shocked and saddened by the news of Yu Menglong’s passing. When someone famous dies, especially under unclear circumstances, it’s natural to feel confused, curious, even restless for answers.\n\nBut in this community, we have set some boundaries about how we talk about it. It was originally a mod note in a post about Yu Menglong's passing and in a previous Yumcha thread, but we thought we should bring it out here for wider attention.\n\n# Why we don’t allow speculation or conspiracies\n\nSpeculating about how or why someone died may feel like “just talking” or \"getting justice\", but it has real consequences.\n\nFamilies read these posts. Friends see them. Misinformation spreads quickly and can worsen grief, harm reputations, and make it harder for the truth to be heard. Our role here is to honour Yu Menglong’s life and work, not to fuel gossip mills.\n\nWe often complain about the pain caused to actors by malicious marketing accounts or C-netizens, sometimes driving them to ill health and career ruin - surely we don't want to be a part of this same mob?\n\nFurthermore, a lot of the \"evidence\" consists of unverified quotes or videos spliced together, most of the time potato quality (wonder why).  This gives enough \"credence\" to the gossip-mongers' claims but is vague enough to fuel further speculation.\n\n# Official information takes time\n\nThe police recently [released a statement](https://content-static.cctvnews.cctv.com/snow-book/index.html?item_id=6022462321692310666&amp;source=50001&amp;sub_source=50001_006).\n\n**Public Security Notice**\n\nSince the launch of the \"Clean Internet - 2025\" special campaign, public security organs have continuously cracked down on and rectified online rumors, effectively maintaining a healthy online environment.\n\nRecently, Yu Menglong (male, 37 years old) fell from a building and died after drinking.\n\nA few individuals, seeking attention and to gain traffic, fabricated and spread false information online, creating and splicing together fake videos, seriously disrupting public order. Regarding this, the public security organs have opened cases for investigation according to law. The relevant details are announced as follows:\n\n1. The case of Zheng XX (female, 40 years old) fabricating the rumor \"Yu Menglong was harmed by others after being set up and then jumped from the building.\" Investigation found that after seeing information online about Yu Menglong's fatal fall, Zheng XX fabricated rumors such as \"a big shot wanted to pressure him into an inappropriate relationship, lackeys set up the meeting for the big shot, he was harmed after being forced to drink, and then jumped from building in despair,\" and posted them in the comments section of popular topics, causing a severe negative social impact.\n2. The case of Yuan XX (female, 29 years old) fabricating the rumor \"Yu Menglong was thrown from the building.\" Investigation found that Yuan XX fabricated rumors through multiple online platforms, such as \"Yu Menglong was hung from a high-rise, had his nails pulled out while alive, was disemboweled, and then thrown down,\" shamelessly seeking attention, causing mental harm to the family, and resulting in a severe negative social impact.\n3. The case of Xu XX (female, 41 years old) fabricating the rumor \"Yu Menglong's mother is being controlled.\" Investigation found that in order to create misunderstandings, Xu XX fabricated rumors during conversations with others, such as \"the surveillance footage was artificially destroyed, there are significant forces behind this, now Yu Menglong's mother and sister are being controlled,\" and posted screenshots of the chat online via her personal social media account, causing a severe negative social impact.\n\nThe above three individuals have admitted to fabricating rumors without reservation and have currently been taken compulsory measures by the public security organs according to law. Furthermore, regarding rumors such as \"Yu Menglong was pushed from the window,\" \"Yu Menglong was abused before falling,\" and \"Yu Menglong's mother was violently driven away by the talent agency,\" the public security organs have also dealt with the relevant personnel according to law.\n\nAfter the incident of Yu Menglong's accidental fall after drinking occurred, the public security organs immediately launched an investigation. Through on-site forensic examination, witness interviews, and retrieving video surveillance, the suspicion of a criminal case was ruled out. The investigation results have been communicated to the family, who have raised no objections. Yu Menglong's mother also issued a statement via the \"Yu Menglong Studio\" Weibo account.\n\nThe internet is not a lawless place. We urge all netizens not to fabricate or spread rumors. We also hope everyone will respect the family's wishes, protect personal privacy, and avoid causing secondary mental harm to the family. Public security organs will crack down on and handle illegal and criminal activities involving the fabrication and spreading of rumors according to law.\n\nChaoyang Public Security Branch  \nSeptember 21, 2025\n\nContrary to fictional portrayals, criminal investigations and autopsies are not instant. Toxicology tests and coroner’s reports can take weeks, sometimes months, to finish.\n\nPolice and medical staff have to be precise, not fast, because releasing incomplete details risks confusing the public. And importantly, families have the right to decide how much private medical information is shared.\n\nSilence from authorities doesn’t mean “cover-up.” It usually means caution, privacy, and procedure.\n\nWeibo has also [released a statement](https://m.weibo.cn/status/5214123281357893):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ymal15cd1rf1.png?width=493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5f52074618f561602e27e6d3f6b5cb6cf148d82\n\n# Respecting cultural differences\n\nSome of you have strong feelings about how police in China are handling this case. It’s okay to share those feelings, but please keep comments respectful and in good faith.\n\nRemember: we are commenting from our own perspectives and value systems, which are limited and often biased. We do not know the full cultural or legal context, so sweeping judgments about “what they should be doing” can be presumptuous and heedless of the situation's sociocultural complexity.\n\n# Remember the humans behind the gossip\n\nI think most of us have been in Chinese and other pop culture fandoms long enough to witness the real-world consequences that rumours have on celebrities, tanking careers and destroying lives.\n\nIn the ongoing Internet witch hunt around Yu Menglong's passing, a few people in the entertainment industry have already been presumed guilty without a trial. They had to release statements defending themselves. I shall not repeat their names here to give them the privacy they need.\n\nHere's an example of how Internet rumour mongering can affect even ordinary people.\n\nIn 2013, Elisa Lam was found dead at Los Angeles’s Cecil Hotel. When police released a video of her acting strangely in an elevator, the internet exploded with theories. Some amateur \"web sleuths\" identified and harassed an innocent musician, convinced of his guilt. Others turned her death into an industry, churning out sensationalising headlines. The truth, later confirmed, was that Elisa tragically died in an accident. By the time facts came out, the speculation had already done lasting damage to her family and to innocent people caught in the frenzy.\n\nSpeculation doesn’t just stay online. It hurts real people. And the mods do not want to enable this.\n\n# What we can talk about\n\nThis includes this announcement post.\n\n* Our feelings about Yu Menglong’s passing.\n* The impact of his work and the legacy he leaves behind.\n* The way people cope with uncertainty and why rumours spread.\n* Broader conversations about how online gossip shapes celebrity culture.\n\nPlease note that speculative comments about Yu Menglong's passing will be removed from now on, and warnings will be sent out to members who continue to speculate unnecessarily.\n\nLet’s keep our community a space of compassion, respect, and truth. Yu Menglong deserves to be remembered for his art and the joy he gave his fans, not as the subject of dubious rumour. Please give his family some space. Details will emerge in due time if they want to share it.\n\n—Your Moderation Team",

    "title": "A Short Spotlight: The Fallen Lady Returns | 贵嫡",
    "content": "\n# The Fallen Lady Returns | 贵嫡\n\n[*The Fallen Lady Returns*](https://mydramalist.com/784376-gui-di) is a minidrama that aired in June of this year (2025).\n\nHaving spent the last week or so exclusively watching mindramas, this is surprisingly the first revenge drama I've come across all week.\n\nThe drama has all the machinations of a *\"my-sucky-husband-killed-my-entire-clan-for-money-and-now-I-somehow-ended-up-back-in-time-and-will-take-my-revenge\"* drama, sprinkled with a bit of *\"oh-and-there-is-a-mysterious-strong-prince-helping-me\"*.\n\nDespite this trope being *very* prolific, it can still make for a very entertaining and satisfying watch if done correctly. And I believe, this drama did it right.\n\n# The Acting\n\nThe drama stars [Teng Ze Wen](https://mydramalist.com/people/132627-teng-ze-wen) as Zhang Xi Yin, the betrayed daughter of a wealthy merchant family, and [Zhan Yu ](https://mydramalist.com/people/46671-zhan-yu)as Duan Jian Li, imperial prince and beloved brother to the emperor.\n\nTeng Ze Wen has dramas such as [*The Double*](https://mydramalist.com/736749-di-jia-qian-jin) and[ *Enslaved by Love*](https://mydramalist.com/763637-yu-nu-jiao) behind her name. I'm quite pleasantly surprised by how she transformed from \"very-irritating-concubine\" in *Enslaved by Love*, to \"fierce-and-inspiring-female-lead\" in this drama.\n\nZhan Yu was most recently seen in [*The Princess's Gambit*](https://mydramalist.com/people/46671-zhan-yu), where he portrayed Tao Hua's younger brother Jiang Chang Jue. I enjoyed him in this drama, and I think his chemistry with Teng Ze Wen was more than convincing.\n\n# Final Impressions\n\n* The revenge was satisfying.\n* The characters were likeable when they should be likeable, and detestable when they should be detestable.\n* The Emperor is competent.\n* The love story does feel like it goes from \"sceptical about this all-knowing woman\" to \"don't you dare touch my woman\" quite quickly, but I'm not complaining.\n\nFinally, I loved the way that these two protected each other and worked together without it feeling like one was constantly bailing the other out. There is one specific scene I loved where Zhang Xi Yin is hurt, and she uses a stumbling block as a synonym for the person who hurt her.

His micro expressions are on point, he can portray fury, lovesickness, worry, and happiness so well. And his fight scenes are very solid, which I actually haven't seen from WXY yet.\n\nOutside of that, this drama is actually incredibly well paced and has a good script, cinematography, and the costuming of a full blown drama. If there was any short drama I could pick to become a long length one it would be this one. It tells the classic story of a time travel revenge plot with an interesting twist. &gt;!The FL regresses but into her own body and not her younger self. Her younger self is still there and the FL is forced to face herself as a mirror while trying to change the future. At the same time she wants to prevent the ML entangling with her to save him but of course they are still inevitably drawn towards each other.

The \"Winter Gone, Spring Comes\" inn gathers struggling young people from all corners of the world, whose genuine and vibrant personal paths weave and collide with the tide of the times, savoring the ups and downs of life, probing the profound themes of human nature and destiny.\n\n(Source: Chinese = iQIYI Conference || Translation = MyDramaList) \n\n***\n\n[Synopsis translated from Baidu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%86%AC%E5%8E%BB%E6%98%A5%E6%9D%A5/64993758): \n\nSet in Beijing from the 1990s to the new millennium, the drama charts the artistic struggles and growth of five young people who have moved to Beijing: Xu Shengli, Zhuang Zhuang, Shen Ranran, Tao Liangliang, and Cao Ye. \n\nThey pursue their dreams in fields such as film and television production and music performance, yet are repeatedly confronted by harsh realities: Xu Shengli’s scripts are constantly rejected, Shen Ranran is limited by her image and can hardly secure lead roles, and Zhuang Zhuang falls into confusion as she tries to break through stylistic barriers in her music. As they step into the 21st century, their life paths diverge, but one thing remains the same – they never lose their passion and pursuit of art.\n\nIn 1990s Beijing, a small inn witnessed the ups and downs of a group of young dream-chasers who had come from all over the country. Xu Shengli, obsessed with scriptwriting but repeatedly turned down, keeps fighting despite constant failure; singer Zhuang Zhuang, who longs for the “elegant” stage, must scrape by with commercial gigs; Shen Ranran, hoping to play leading roles, is caught between opportunities and compromises in the glamorous entertainment industry; the talented saxophonist Tao Liangliang plays under the overpass for passersby to live his musical dream; Guo Zongbao, a background/extra actor who loves the arts, works tirelessly at odd jobs to pay for his wife’s and child's medical expenses; and painter Cao Ye, full of avant-garde ideas, longs to make a name for himself but is misunderstood by all. \n\n&gt;!They fight hard for their dreams, yet reality proves cruel and relentless. As the new millennium arrives, some persist, some are forced to give up – but in their hearts, the flame of art never goes out.!&lt;\n\n[Baidu Baike](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%86%AC%E5%8E%BB%E6%98%A5%E6%9D%A5/64993758) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37071311/) | [MDL](https://mydramalist.com/778626-dong-qu-chun-lai)\n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses I share in the \"trailers &amp; posters\" posts are based on the original Chinese sources (Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

    "title": "Ashes of Love or Love and Redemption - which one do you like more?",
    "content": "I recently finished watching Ashes of Love (AoL) and started rewatching Love and Redemption (LaD) and since I keep hearing people compare these two I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on them! *spoiler - one of them is my all time favourite ❤️*\n\n---------------\n\n**Similarities? / female leads**\n\nI keep hearing fans call them 'similar' but I personally think they are VERY different from each other. The only similarity I can think of are the female leads.\n\nXuanji (LaR) and Jinmi (AoL) are both born without the ability to feel which is why they both tend to act naive and childlike but Xuanji is someone who can be your partner in crime while Jinmi will most likely accidentally spoil it. Initially, for me, they were both equally likeable that was until Jinmi started to lead on Runyu (sml) while dating Xufeng (ml). Her excuse was that she didn't want Runyu to be sad since he had just lost his mother but she got a lot of chances to break off her engagement with him after that! Between his mother dying and her emotions getting locked again she had a lot of time to tell him she didn't want to marry him but she didn't do anything. She was engaged with one brother and making out with the other one which made me so mad!!!! Xuanji was always straightforward about her feelings and was always loyal to her sister, Sifeng (ml), the 6th brother (sml) and everyone she loved. Jinmi's character deteriorated while Xuanji's character developed and she became a powerful and independent woman while Jinmi remained a love interest. It's kinda clear I like Xuanji better than Jinmi so I'm not gonna say much anymore hehe\n\n\nPoint to: LaR\n-------------\n\n**Male leads**\n\nYOU DONT KNOW HOW BIG MY CRUSH ON XUFENG WAS 😭😭😭. I know people think he's a brat but I'm a young fangirl and his cold but playful attitude had me daydreaming about him all the time 😭. But as the drama progressed I fell out of love with him and started to notice Runyu more and a major reason why is because his character is a stale bread from a Michelin restaurant. Imagine a character who has everything; his parents love him, his step brother who should be evil loves, he is rich and handsome and never faced any issues in life, has girls lining up for his for his looks and is admired by everyone, what's so special about him? NOTHING!!!! Even his playful demeanor vanished after the human realm arc ended!! \n\nIn contrast Sifeng (LaR) is a mysterious character who is cold on the  surface and just too perfect but there are more layers under that cold attitude. His sect leaders were abusive and he never saw his parents growing up. He wasn't loved and didn't know what it meant until he met Xuanji. You can see all of the little expressions and realisations he has when he does his first times: his first time making friends, his first time when someone cared for him, his first time being silly, his first time being honest about his feelings. He even does reckless things only for Xuanji even though he knows he will get severely punished afterwards. This makes him more human and relatable. The worst that happened to Xufeng was getting locked in his room by his parents but Sifeng literally went through hell. Sifeng also let's go of Xuanji when she tells him she likes 6th gege (which was a misunderstanding) but doesn't force his feelings on her and let's her love the person she loves because he wants her to be happy. But Xufeng...... my Xufeng... he became delusional. To be fair I really felt bad for him because Jinmi did say she loves him 5 days before saying she doesn't and marrying Runyu but like come on! She told u 'no' 5 times in 5 days so it's time to let go. You deserve better!\n\nPoint to: LaR\n--------------------\n\n**Villains**\n\nVillains in both the dramas were narcissistic psychopathic dictators and I don't know who's worse then who so point goes to both of them here. (Not talking about Runyu because my boy was not the villain in AoL despite what online comments say 😭)\n\nPoint to : both\n---------------\n\n**Plot**\n\nIf you remove romance from LaR it'll be an adventure drama about 4 friends and their journey to conquering evil heavenly realm deities while becoming more powerful. But if you remove romance from AoL it'll a Runyu's revenge story which is pretty interesting not gonna lie but then our protagonist Jin mi and Xufeng would become unnecessary and unimportant characters in their own drama. \n\nLaR is also consistently good and has a good balance between heartwrenching and heartwarming lighthearted scenes. AoL also has a great balance but the reason why this drama didn't become my favourite is because it focused too much on the side characters instead of the main characters. As much as I love Runyu I still want to watch more of Xufeng and Jinmi 😭.\n\nPoint to: LaR\n-------------\n\n**2nd lead couples**\n\nI personally didn't like either of the couples though didn't find myself skipping scenes of the 2nd lead couples of LaR so I guess that's a plus point. I also liked how they showcased the struggle of women even though I wish they showed us more of how the sister recovered from her trauma and fought back. \n\nPoint to: No one\n-------------\n\n**Overall**\n\nI saw a lot of people online talk about AoL becoming interesting after the human realm arc but for me, I ADORED their first meeting arc and their human realm arc. Everything after that was ok. It wasn't bad but it made the story less memorable. *I* found Love and Redemption to be consistently good throughout. Love and Redemption along with The Double and Till the End of the Moon were also the dramas that made me join the Cdrama fandom so I have a special place in my heart for this drama so for me, I loveeeeeeee Love and Redemption. \n\nThis is not a hate to AoL because that drama was also amazing, I just prefer LaR more. Which one do you guys like more? ",

After Li Mo, it was unparalleled in glory, but eventually, it was implicated in the government and ended up in ruin.\n\nAs time went by, Li Zhen, the youngest daughter of the eighth room of the Li clan, resolutely embarked on the road of ink-making to solve her livelihood. With her talent and hard work, she became a dark horse in the Huizhou ink industry. Luo Wen Qian, the second son of the Luo family, planned and laid out to restore the family business and stirred up the pattern of the Huizhou ink industry with his own strength.\n\nThe two of them fought wits and courage with the new ink industry upstarts Tian Mo family, and Li Mo returned to the peak. The sea ban was reopened, and facing the challenges of the overseas ink industry, Li Zhen gathered the essence of the Huizhou ink industry, made top-level ink products, and won the reputation of \"the best ink in the world\" for Huizhou ink.\n\n(Source: iQiyi)\n\n[Baidu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%AE%B6%E4%B8%9A/64394953) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/36883114/) \n\n***\n\n**Note:**\n\nToday is iQIYI's iJoy conference day, September 25.\n\nEach of the four major domestic streaming platforms holds similar events a few times a year to showcase their upcoming dramas.

    "content": "**Note:** If you're a **brand new account,** have **not joined the sub** or have **not commented in the sub much**, your post will be held for review. If you've **not participated in the sub before,** you will be asked to join discussions first.\n\nThis is so that you will be familiar with our sub's rules and posting guidelines before making your first post.\n\nNow, let's start with the r/Cdrama's rules.\n\n# Rule 1: Ask for drama recommendations only in r/CDramaRecs\n\n* **This sub is for discussions only.**\n* Requests for drama recs go here ➡️ r/CDramaRecs\n* New accounts with low karma can’t post there (anti-spam measure).\n* *Need karma?* [Read this guide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/wiki/ntr-guidetoreddit/)\n\nThat means, if your post is asking for a Cdrama recommendation, it won't be approved.\n\n# Rule 2: Use Spoiler Tags\n\n* No spoilers in the post title or it'll be removed\n* Use spoiler tags in spoilers in body text or comments\n\n[**Read our guide about using spoiler tags**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1e75uc6/weekly_reminder_about_spoilers_july_19_2024/)\n\n# Rule 3: Do Not Spam and Make Reposts\n\n* **Check recent posts** if they are talking about the same topic.\n* No duplicates, plagiarism, or spam.\n* *Extreme spam = instant ban.*\n* Duplicating posts or comments = spamming.\n* Plagiarising other people's content = ban.\n\n# Rule 4: Be Nice and Practice Basic Reddiquette\n\nAKA Don't be a jerk.\n\n* **Be nice.** No insults, racism, or hate.\n* No attacking actors, cultures, or sub members.\n* No rude, derogatory/discriminating terms, personal attacks, harassment or demeaning comments to other members.\n* Be culturally sensitive. More info: [**Can we be more culturally sensitive?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1do09lk/can_we_be_more_culturally_sensitive_in_this_sub/)\n\n**PS: We usually give chances, but if it's bad enough, we will ban the user without warnings.**\n\n# Rule 5: Stick to the topic of the sub\n\n**Self-posts must be about Chinese dramas.**\n\nTopics that will be removed:\n\n* Japanese or Korean dramas\n* Politics\n* Celebrity magazine pics/shots\n* Celebrity's looks:\n   * Talking about their looks\n   * Posts saying that they look alike. *These can come across as insensitive or even perpetuate racial stereotypes, so we simply do not allow them.*\n* Celebrity popularity, endorsements, scandals, gossip. You can post them in weekly threads (see below)\n* Rating actors / discussing their popularity / pitting one actor against another\n\nCelebrity-related topics allowed:\n\n* Their dramas and acting. (Use pics from their dramas, not from their magazine shoots.)\n\n# Rule 6: No low-effort posts\n\nWhen writing a post, remember that [r/cdrama](https://www.reddit.com/r/cdrama) is a forum, not social media. It's a place to discuss Chinese dramas. Some guidelines:\n\n**#1 No AI generated posts.** This sub is for genuine discussions from actual humans. Users/bots of AI-gen posts will be banned.\n\n**#2 If you're a content creator**\n\na) **Be a community member first**  \n→ Comment, chat, engage in other people's discussions. Don’t be a drive-by poster who just uses the sub to promote stuff.\n\nb) **No spammy vibes:**  \n❌ **No** promo in every comment/post.  \n❌ **No** random link dumps (give context!). ❌ **No** sly promos with links to your sub/blog via watermark\n\n**✅ Link OK if:**  \n✔ It’s a **CDrama review** (blog/video/podcast) but **only if** you want to expand a topic: For eg: \"If you want deeper insights on ‘The Double,’ read my blog post.\"\n\n**#3 Posts with a photo/link must have at least 150 characters of text explaining why the link/photo is being shared.**\n\nWe need to differentiate you from spammers and this is the minimum requirement.\n\n**#4 Please don't use papparazzi/daipai/fan photos** ([We explain why in this post)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1h5bs4j/about_the_use_of_daipai_reuters_photos/).\n\n**#5 Name the drama in the title of your post (in full, not using abbreviations**)- don't expect people to know the actor/character/what you're talking about\n\n**#6 We will remove posts that are confusing, rambling or  a wall of text.**\n\n**#7 This is a forum, so posts must spark discussions.**\n\nIt's nice that you've enjoyed *The Double,* but tell us more beyond 'Wang Xinyue is so hot'. That belongs in our many weekly threads.\n\n**#8 No posts/comments requesting or link dropping illegal or pirated sites.**\n\n**#9 Fanart/crafts can be shared in weekly threads**\n\n**#10 If a search of** r/Cdrama**, Google or Mydramalist can easily answer your question** → Mods may redirect or ask you to search instead.\n\n(Eg: \"Is there a second season of The Double?\" or \"How many episodes does The Double have?\")\n\nRead our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/wiki/faq/) and [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/wiki/index/#wiki_posting_guidelines) for more information.\n\nThis is a tl;dr version of our rules.

After the fall of Hong Kong in December 1941, Macau became an important port and international intelligence center for the transfer and exchange of strategic materials from various countries, and was pushed to the forefront. \n\nThe Portuguese Macau government was called \"neutral\", but in fact it allowed the Japanese army's spy agency to run rampant. Patriotic Chinese people such as Ho Yin, Ma Man-kei and the underground workers of the Communist Party of China – Ke Lin and others, united their compatriots with a strong sense of patriotism and responsibility, and gathered the strength of Macau Chinese communities such as the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Kiang Wu Hospital and Tung Sin Tong Charity Society to fight hard. \n\nIn times of crisis, they found that only the Communist Party of China could save China and bring new hope to the Chinese nation. Patriotic Chinese in Macau and the Communist Party of China worked together to fight wits and courage with the Japanese invaders on various fronts such as financial warfare, intelligence warfare, and material warfare, and achieved major victories again and again. \n\nMacau’s anti-Japanese and national salvation movement not only helped Macau compatriots to survive the difficult “turmoil” period in Macau’s history, but also raised a large amount of anti-Japanese war materials and funds, making an important contribution in supporting the [Chinese War of Resistance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War) and the World Anti-Fascist War. \n\n[MDL](https://mydramalist.com/777175-once-upon-a-time-in-macao) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/36189222/) \n\n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses from the \"trailers &amp; posters\" that I post in our sub are based on original sources (such as Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

Qi Aihua [Guo Tao] and Huo Qinglian [Liu Lin] had different personalities but tolerated each other; Cao Dongfang [Guo Xiaodong] supported his family with his father Cao Benshun [Huo Qing] after his wife died. Life was difficult but happy.\n\nBecause the two families gave birth to a girl 女, Qi Shi [Guan Xiaotong], and a boy 子, Cao Xin [Wang Ziqi], on the same day, the two families made up the Chinese character \"good 好”. \n\nAs the children grow up, their stories slowly unfold. The children experience the test of family affection, friendship and love, and the adults also have to face the problems of career, marriage and family. Although life makes people stumble, everyone strives to find their own extraordinary happiness in ordinary life.\n\n***\n\n[Synopsis from Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37233336/):\n\nThe drama begins with the warm and peaceful neighborhood story of the Cao and Qi families in Qingwu Town, a northern factory and mining town in the early 1990s. It uses the life trajectories of Qi Shi and Cao Xin as the context to describe the ups and downs of the lives of the two families over 30 years, presenting a story of kinship, friendship and love that grows together.\n\n[Baidu Baike](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%94%9F%E9%80%A2%E5%85%B6%E6%97%B6/64842108) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37233336/) | [MDL](https://mydramalist.com/776465-sheng-feng-qi-shi) \n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses I share in the \"trailers &amp; posters\" posts are based on the original Chinese sources (Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

He underwent a profound transformation, fully “awoke,” and ultimately crushed the enemy’s sinister plan, growing into a true communist fighter.\n\n[From MDL](https://mydramalist.com/685277-awaken):\n\n~~ Adapted from the novel \"Xing Lai\" (醒来) by Hai Fei (海飞).\n\n[Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/36126289/) \n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses I share in the \"trailers &amp; posters\" posts are based on the original Chinese sources (Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

    "title": "My reflections on The Untamed, and Favourite Moments (Unforgettable experience)",
    "content": "Please be mindful of spoilers in this post! And beware, this is quite long. 😅 So sorry. (I’m nervous to post this!) I just finished \\*The Untamed\\* a few days ago, and I don’t think I’ll ever forget the rollercoaster it took me on. I came into it with high expectations, but the way it managed to be both funny and heartbreaking, while also full of quiet devotion between the characters, affected me more than I expected. Wuxian and Wangji have changed my heart forever. The affection I feel for their bond is something I know will stay with me for a long time, it feels too precious to let go of. Every glance, every quiet gesture, every act of care between them hit me in a way I’ve never felt with any other story. I started The Untamed mostly out of curiosity for its popularity, but I wasn’t expecting Wuxian and Wangji’s relationship to affect me as deeply as it did. I’d never stepped into the BL drama world before, and after watching this, I can’t imagine any other pairing sharing a bond as deep and meaningful as theirs. I wanted to share some personal reflections on the ending, talk about my favourite, \\*\\*unforgettable\\*\\* moments and share how some of the characters made me feel.\n\n**Ending thoughts**\n\nTo be completely honest, watching the ending was really stressful for me. Episode 50 felt like finally witnessing two soulmates who had been through everything arrive at the moment we’d been waiting for, yet it wasn’t fully shown. When they parted, I struggled to believe what I was seeing and felt uneasy. After losing Wei Ying for sixteen years, it was painful to watch Lan Zhan walk away from him, I couldnt understand it. I also had trouble accepting Wangji becoming Chief Cultivator. I haven’t read the novel myself, but I saw comments from readers saying it didn’t fit his personality, and I found myself agreeing. If his promise was to fight evil and protect the weak, couldn’t he simply travel the world alongside Wuxian, fighting evil and protecting the weak without needing any official title, and still fulfil that promise? The weight of their separation hit me so hard that I felt anxious and heartbroken just watching them walk away from each other.\n\nAfter learning more about the censorship the drama faced as a BL, it clicked, and I understood why the show had to end this way. The separation was more of a compromise, a way for the show to wrap things up within the restrictions, while still slipping in that final moment of Lan Zhan and Wei Ying returning to each other. Understanding this helped me release some of the conflict I felt. The pain of their parting softened because I knew that in any true version of the story, Wangji would never leave Wuxian. I’m currently watching the special edition, and I’ve read that there’s no separation in this version. I’m so glad this exists, even though I haven’t finished it yet. Just knowing that Wangji and Wuxian stay together in this version makes me feel a lot better about the ending, and it’s comforting to see the ending play out the way it was truly meant to.\n\n**Favourite Moments**\n\n**Episode 27**: I will never forget the moment Wangji cried. From the first time I saw this scene, I could not stop crying. I found myself returning to the scene again and again, even as I continued through the rest of the show. I’d cry just thinking about it, at random moments throughout the day, at work, as I brushed my teeth etc. It broke my heart again and again, but made me love the show even more. I think I’ll remember it for a long time\n\nLeading up to this moment, Wuxian rescues the Wen Clan remnants, all branded as enemies by the other clans, who see them as unworthy to spare. To the cultivation world, Wuxian’s choice looks like rebellion. But to him, it’s simple: they are innocent, and their lives deserve protecting. I could feel the isolation Wuxian must have felt, standing against a world that refused to care. \n\nIt was heartbreaking to watch this moment unfold. When the two confront each other underneath the rain, things become really emotional and Wuxian asks Wangji what orthodoxy he is supposed to be rebelling against when that same orthodoxy allows innocent lives to be sacrificed? Wangji is clear about Wuxian’s heart, not why he uses unorthodox methods, but that he wants to fight evil and protect the weak. Up until now, every unconventional choice Wuxian has made, mainly his turning to demonic cultivation since returning from the Burial Mounds, challenged the strict black-and-white world Wangji had always known, and went against everything he had been taught. Still, Wangji, in this moment knowing Wuxian as he does, understands the moral conviction behind his actions to save the innocent Wen people, and steps aside. I wanted him to follow Wuxian, to step outside the boundaries of his upbringing, yet I understood why he was hesitant. Following Wuxian would not only mean breaking the rules and abandoning the discipline instilled in him since childhood, but it would also implicate the Gusu Lan Clan itself. His actions could never be his alone, they carried the weight of his family, its reputation, and its legacy. He understood Wuxian’s heart and his intentions, yet he restrained himself, unable to step outside the path he had been raised to uphold. I felt his hurt, his conflict, his torment as if it were my own.\n\nEveryone views him as dangerous, but Wangji does not. He did not accuse Wuxian of rebellion or try to stop him. In the end, he watches silently, his expression a quiet mix of concern, understanding and acceptance, accepting that Wuxian was going to do the right thing no matter how much it would hurt him (Wuxian), even as it meant he was turning his back on the cultivation world and declaring rebellion in the eyes of those who misunderstood him. He steps aside, and looking so pained, a tear breaks out as he watches Wuxian ride away into the distance. I felt so much heartbreak that I couldn’t stop crying. That single tear carried the full weight of his hesitation, his quiet conflict, and the pain of watching Wuxian leave. I know it reflected the heartbreak of watching someone he had come to care for deeply, someone he had faced life-and-death situations with, walk away on a different path, despite their shared bond and aligned goals. The music that played over the scene was utterly heartbreaking as well. I later realised that I had heard this OST being played many times before, but it had never moved me until this scene. Here, it perfectly captured the pain of their separation and the depth of their bond. \n\n**Episode 18**: During the childhood flashback on Wuxian’s first night at Lotus Pier, the siblings were shown walking back from the woods together. The siblings’ theme song (called Yanli’s theme) starts playing, this time with singing. Hearing it sung for the first time in this scene, after having only heard the melody as an instrumental throughout the show, made me really emotional. The music captured the quiet, beautiful moment and highlighted the depth of Jiang Chen, Yanli and Wuxian's bond. The singing caught me completely off guard, adding an extra layer of emotion I hadn’t experienced before for their bond, and it made their connection feel even stronger amid everything happening around them (the Jiang Clan Massacre). It reminded me of the siblings’ unspoken connection, their struggles, and the closeness that carried them through that moment.\n\n**Wangji Drunk (the second time):** I cannot forget the drunk scenes, Yibo’s acting was flawless. He genuinely looked drunk, without feeling exaggerated or over the top. After Wuxian carried Wangji to the bed, I thought it would be over, but the show kept giving us more and it was impossible to stop smiling. How they ended up on the outskirts of the city cracks me up every time. It was hilarious seeing Lan Zhan stealing and gifting those 2 chickens to Wei Ying. I love the way Lan Zhan’s eyes scanned his surroundings until his gaze landed on the pole. Wuxian’s concern as he chased after him, followed by the shock of realising Wangji had written “Wangji was here” on the pole, was priceless. And then, Wuxian going back to write “Wuxian was here too” was pure high school energy… so sweet and heartwarming. I loved how concerned he was, for someone as reckless as he is. The next scene was Wangji fighting the masked intruder. It was awesome to watch drunk Lan Zhan fight like he wasn’t drunk at all. I loved how Wuxian backed off and let him take on the fight, he trusted him completely while still being there to support him if needed. And the way Wuxian had to stop him even though the masked man was gone. SO CUTEEEE. \n\nThe water scene was equally adorable. Wuxian helps Wangji drink, holding the cup for him with a mix of patience and exasperation, as if Wangji might be being a little inconvenient, but it’s obvious how much he cares. I loved the way Wangji presses his lips together after drinking, to show how thirsty he was. Just so cute I can’t. And of course, this counted as an indirect kiss, since they drank from the same cup. \n\nTheir question-and-answer time also made me feel a mix of sadness and joy. Seeing Wuxian in this moment, smiling and laughing so freely, I could almost feel the weight lifting off him, like a glimpse of the carefree, joyful teen he had been sixteen years ago. It was the kind of happiness that hit me in the chest, bittersweet because of everything he had endured. I loved how he didn’t ask Lan Zhan outright how he had known it was him at the mountain in episode 2. Earlier in the day, Lan Zhan had told him to think about it, and even while drunk, Wuxian respected that, choosing not to cheat for the answer. Lan Zhan’s sleeping position is also really funny. It also just made me think though, how grateful I am that the Gusu Lan Clan enforces a set bedtime. Because if I lost someone for 16 years, I don’t think I would be able to sleep at all. \n\n**Episode 26:** One of the moments that made my heart skip a beat was during the Jin annual monster hunt, when Wei Ying and Lan Zhan meet in the forest. Wei Ying asks Lan Zhan about how its been for him rewriting the rules, but instead, Lan Zhan says he’s been practicing music and asks if Wei Ying wants to hear it and see if it has any effects. Wei Ying responds, “Who am I to you? Can you mind your own business?” It’s heartbreaking because, as the viewer, we know he’s trying to brush Lan Zhan off while hiding the truth about losing his golden core. Then Lan Zhan quietly turns the question back on him: **“What am I to you?”** My heart melted for them!!!!!! I couldnt stop covering my face. It was so moving to see who they have become to each other. Up until this point, Lan Zhan had warned Wei Ying about the dangers of demonic cultivation with concern, but Wei Ying had interpreted these warnings as accusations, creating a subtle tension between them. Hearing this soft exchange about their feelings gave me butterflies, and I felt so moved and emotionally fluttered.\n\n**Episode 35:** Another moment that had me completely captivated was when Lan Zhan quietly offers to carry Wei Ying. Wei Ying immediately brushes it off, saying it would look unsightly, but Lan Zhan, quietly asks, **“Is it unsightly?**” 😭😭😭❤️ MY HEARTTT!  The intimacy of the moment just melted me... I love them so freaking much. I also felt a little sad though because Lan Zhan reminds Wei Ying that he had once suggested carrying him, but Wei Ying doesn’t remember. I wish he did, it would have made the moment even sweeter.\n\n**Episode 42:**  I loved the scene where Wangji takes Wuxian to escape the treasure room together. (After everybody finds out he’s Wuxian because he was able to unleash his sword) Wuxian is already seen as a common enemy, yet Lan Zhan openly protects him, taking charge without hesitation and making sure no one can hurt him. It’s such a heartwarming moment, and I just love every second of it, the way Wangji doesn’t hesitate, doesn't care about his reputation, the trust between them, and how completely he puts Wuxian first even in a tense situation. Then comes the part where Wangji openly declares that he knows Mo Xuanyu is actually Wei Wuxian, drawing his swords toward everyone and causing them to stumble back in worry. It’s exactly what he wished he could have done sixteen years ago. Meanwhile, Wuxian is still trying to protect him, speaking in a nagging voice, insisting him to pretend he got tricked. Then comes the moment Wuxian realises that Lan Zhan is serious, and with a sighing voice, he warns him that there’s no going back, Huanguang Jun’s reputation will be ruined if he leaves with him. I loved the tension, the trust, and the way that exchange captured everything about their bond, all in just a few brief moments. It gave me that incredible feeling of them against the world, standing together no matter what. I was so happy. I just love them. I love them together so, so much.  Lan Zhan’s right there, side by side with Wei Ying, in full support. It’s thrilling, intimate, and so emotionally satisfying because it shows that in the middle of chaos, they rely on and protect each other completely. \n\n**Episode 43:**  During that snowy night in hiding at the Silent Room in Gusu, when Wei Ying said it didn’t matter to him anymore who was playing the other flute, I understood that too, I didn’t care either, what mattered then was that Lan Zhan was by his side. In that moment, all I cared about was the two of them and their connection, it felt so touching. He reflects on how everyone who once trusted him is gone, but then he looks at Lan Zhan and realises that having him by his side now is enough, and he drinks to him. Their thoughts mirror each other so beautifully, carrying such deep devotion, and you can just feel it in your heart: (Viki Subs)\n\n**\\* Wei Ying: “Thankfully.”**\n\n**\\* Lan Zhan: “There’s still someone who believes in you in this world.”**\n\n**\\* Wei Ying: “Lan Zhan, cheers to you. Having one soulmate in this life is enough.”**\n\n**\\* Lan Zhan: “Nothing else is needed, it’s just a matter of clear conscience.”**\n\n**\\* Wei Ying: “I don’t care if they defame or slander me. As long as I have a clear conscience.”**\n\n**Other Characters**\n\nI never really liked the fact that Yanli ended up marrying Jin Zixuan. Even though she clearly loved him and cared for him, I can’t get past the idea that she chose to marry into a family that was openly hostile toward her brother, Wei Wuxian. Jin Zixuan never really stood up against his family for how they treated the Wen Clan remnants, using them as live bait, and yet she still decided to join that household. I understand that she married for love and obviously cared for him, and I can’t argue with that, but I can’t help the way I feel about it. Maybe on the second rewatch I’ll be able to watch it with a new perspective. From the first watch her relationship with Jin Zixuan felt underdeveloped. At the same time, I truly admire Yanli, she loved Wei Ying and Jiang Cheng so deeply, believed in them to the very end, and never blamed them for anything. Her loyalty and care make me respect her, even if I struggle with her choices. \n\nAs for Jiang Chen, I understood him throughout the show. I understood how Wei Ying’s rebellion against the other sects would put him in a difficult position. He carried the weight of the entire clan as its new leader. He was also deeply hurt because Wei Ying had broken his promise to be his right-hand man. Yet when he sought to end Wen Ning at the Burial Mounds, showing no gratitude for the siblings who had once saved his life, I found it impossible to care for him in that moment. I couldn’t justify him any longer. By the time he apologised at the end, it barely moved me, because my heart had long been fully invested in Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian. As a viewer, forgiveness felt almost irrelevant because Wuxian already had Wangji. What did it matter? One soulmate was enough. \n\nI also didn’t like the resentment Jiang Cheng carried toward Lan Wangji throughout the show. He constantly blamed Wei Wuxian for saving Lan Wangji in the Tortoise Cave, believing it angered the Wens and caused the slaughter of his family. I understood why he felt that way, but I still didn’t like it. I like how Wuxian could tolerate Jiang Cheng reprimanding him, even scolding him for his actions, but he could never tolerate it if those words spoke ill of Lan Zhan. This was especially clear in the Ancestral Hall at Lotus Cave, where Wuxian immediately got defensive, showing just how deeply he cared for Lan Zhan.\n\nXiao Xingchen: What happened to Xiao Xingchen and Song Lan was incredibly heartbreaking. I feel like their story runs parallel to Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji, showing us a version of them that never found a happy ending. It felt like a warning. I wonder if Wuxian reflected on it, making him appreciate Lan Zhan by his side even more. Seeing their fate made me realise just how meaningful it was for Wuxian to have Lan Wangji with him, and how precious their bond truly is, and how easily it could be torn apart by the cruelty of others, like how Song Lan lost Xiao Xingchen. Also Xiao Xingchen is so handsome. \n\nAnother random thought, I wished after the initial 3 month separation Wuxian had asked Wangji about his leg. It was never mentioned again after the Tortoise Cave Arc. A small moment like that could have added a lot to their connection and shown Wuxian’s care more deeply, especially when there was so much tension during their reunion because of him using demonic cultivation.\n\nI find myself listening to the opening song on repeat these days. When I first watched the show, I only saw it once and skipped it throughout because I didn’t want to get spoiled, but now I love it so much. I love the orchestra at the beginning, the delicate and sad qin playing followed by the flute, and then the way it transitions into that war-like, intense music. It’s so beautiful and perfectly captures the story’s mix of quiet intimacy, tension, and epic struggles.\n\n**Final Reflections**\n\nI really enjoyed following the story overall, but toward the end, I did get a bit lost trying to keep up with  the connection between the Yin Tiger Seal, the Scarlet Peak master, his saber, and all those details, it didn’t fully make sense to me. I found myself rewinding a lot throughout the show to make sure I understood everything, but by the end, I was so invested in Wuxian and Lan Zhan that the rush of seeing their story play out made me lose track of it. The final arc in the temple felt a little anticlimactic since it was already obvious that Jin Guangyao was the villain. Honestly, I was expecting a bigger, more epic showdown with Wuxian and Wangji against the cultivation world, more fighting scenes rather than being confined in the temple. Maybe it’ll be more fun to watch a second time, now that I have no expectations and already know how things play out. It will also be easier to follow the plot on a second watch!\n\nAnyway, to wrap things up, Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji were the heartbeat of the show. From episode 33 onward, every scene they shared, never leaving each other’s side, meant everything to me... When the whole world turned its back on Wuxian, Wangji was there. Their devotion, their sacrifices, their longing, that was everything. Watching their journey reach its conclusion was an emotional experience like no other. The OSTs played during the final episode hit so hard it had me clutching my chest, it carried the full weight of their journey while wrapping up the story in such an emotional way. It’s their story, their interactions, their love that have made me fall in love with them so deeply that I never want to forget the attachment I feel to their bond. I won't even try to look for anything that can top this chemistry and pairing. Thanks for reading. I’m so sorry for how long this is. I’d love to hear what you thought of the show, and if the same scenes I loved impacted you the same way!",

    "content": "I'm only about three episodes in, but in short, disappointing and fail to live up to expectations.\n\nThe FL is so illogical both personality wise and ability. So let's frame the background, FL has been acting as a general on behalf of her brother and have had sufficient battlefield success that she can have an audience with the emperor and her words have some level of belief by said emperor and his court. In that case, she must have been acting in that role for some time. \n\nHave been pretending to be someone else for a while, she must have kept to herself and remained aloof. Minimal interaction minimises the chance of discovery. Plus her recent tragic fate - her father abandoned her, blinded her, stripped her of her identity; her brother wants her dead, sent assassins after her; and she was heavily wounded and fell off a cliff. No under the same circumstances can remain happy, jovial and positive. \n\nNext, she was a successful and capable general. She is not Mulan when she just enlisted on behalf of her father. Why then is she so weak? You can say she is wounded or poisoned and needs to recover, in that case why is she training so hard? Plus if she needs to recuperate, she could have reenlisted after recovery, when she is at her best and could quickly advance into an influential position. Why make her weak just to insert some \"growth\" and quirkly interactions with the ML?\n\nUrgh, unable to move past this double failure of personality and ability.",

The triad boss seeks revenge for his son, unleashing a bloody storm. Policewoman Tong Hin, however, remains steadfast in upholding justice, relentlessly pursuing the truth.\n\n***\n\n[More details translated from 南方都市报 Nanfang Dushi Bao](https://m.mp.oeeee.com/oe/BAAFRD0000202409271004306.html):\n\n^(Please note that the character names are translated to the typical spelling for Cantonese names.)\n\nAfter a 20-year hiatus from television dramas, Nick Cheung reunites with Myolie Wu, a decade-long friendship now taking center stage, joining forces with rising actor Joseph Zeng to form the \"new golden trio\" of **Justice Is Mine**.\n\nIn the series:\n\n* Nick Cheung plays Chun Yu, a conflicted character torn between his professional identity and family obligations.  \n* Myolie Wu portrays Tong Hin, a principled police officer grappling with moral dilemmas as darkness encroaches.  \n* Joseph Zeng takes on the role of Hon Lit, a young man forced to suppress his edge for self-preservation – but can he hold onto his convictions as power shifts around him?  \n\nThree complex characters, three distinct acting styles, and three seemingly divergent audience demographics converge in this bold experiment. The creative team aims to break boundaries, crafting a new era of Hong Kong dramas with the broadest possible appeal.  \n\nNotably, mainland actor Joseph Zeng, a native of Shenzhen, Guangdong, naturally exudes a \"Hong Kong vibe,\" seamlessly blending into the Hong Kong drama market. This casting combination is seen as a promising formula for breaking down drama viewing barriers under the new Hong Kong drama model.  \n\n**Justice is Mine** delves into the tangled conflicts of human nature and the struggle for justice. Through its intricate plot and multi-dimensional characters, the series immerses viewers in an investigative journey, uncovering both the righteous and darker sides of humanity.  \n\nA unique aspect of the drama is its use of the audience’s perspective as an entry point, sparking discussion and prompting reflection: Is human nature truly just black and white? Can the law fully encompass moral boundaries? And when societal roles clash with familial duties, what choice is the right one?  \n\nWith enigmatic cases, deeply layered characterizations, and tightly interwoven narratives, the series explores the complexities of human decisions at a profound level. It aims to resonate with audiences while opening new possibilities for deeper integration between Hong Kong and mainland Chinese television.  \n\n[Baidu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%8D%E7%8B%97%E4%B9%8B%E8%A1%80/64946817) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37014251/) | [MDL](https://mydramalist.com/776187-chu-gou-zhi-xue)\n\n***\n\n**Translated Synopses**\n\nNote: All translated synopses I share in the “trailers &amp; posters” posts are based on the original Chinese sources (Douban, Baidu, Chinese Wikipedia, etc.) and were first published here.

In episode one, he meets ~~Princess~~ Jiang Yun. Jian Yun has a habit of venturing out of the palace under the guise of, well, not a princess. She's a businesswoman, and she owns the restaurant next to Xiao Ning's Tea Pavilion. The two strike up a deal and, after providing a sizable investment, Jiang Yun finds herself partnered with Xiao Ning.\n\nRemember, Xiao Ning has no idea she is a princess.\n\nI feel like I've spent too much time on the storyline, so let me just wrap this up without giving away too much. Xiao Ning is constantly underestimated, and seeing him prove snobby people wrong - it's just delightful.\n\nThe characters are amazing, the music is amazing, and the writing is amazing.\n\nI would personify this drama as a \"shot of serotonin\".\n\n# It made me happy, and I think it will make you happy too :) \n",

    "content": "We don't have many new entries but what is hot and what is not in c-dramas this week? What is worth your time? For viewers who often wonder, ***“What should I watch besides my favorite actor’s latest drama?”*** \\- this ranking guide offers a good starting point. It provides information on highly-watched c-dramas for the week. It also introduces lesser-known but high-quality dramas that are being well-received in China, yet might be flying under the radar for global viewers. Within the top 10, while some shows on the list may feature big-name stars, you’ll also find hidden gems with lesser-known casts that are gaining traction due to strong storytelling and production.\n\nTOP 10 DRAMAS (**Dramas that are airing on both TV/WEB are excluded from the Web List**)\n\n**Bold**\\- New Entry / **Bold +** ***Italics***\\- New No. 1\n\n|Rank|WEB (platforms)|Television (TV)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|***The Journey of Legend (Cheng Yi, Guli Nazha)-costume (1st week)***|The Long Way Back (Hun Jun, Li Naiwen)- republican (2nd week)|\n|2|Footprints of Change (Tong Yao, Cheng Lei)- republican|Wild Ambition Bloom (Rayzha, Tony Yang)- republican|\n|3|Moonlit Reunion (Xu Kai, Tian Xi Wei)- costume|This Thriving Land (Yang Mi, Ou Hao)- republican|\n|4|Shadow Love (Song Yi, Cheng Lei)- costume|**Growing Together S2 (Zhang Jiayi, Chen Hao)- modern comedy**|\n|5|**Mobius (Bai Jingting, Janice Man)- modern**|Our Home land (Wang Lei, Yuqi Chen)- Republican|\n|6|Twelve Letters (Zhou Yiran, Wang Yinglu)- modern|Legend of the Female General (ZhouYe, Cheng Lei) costume|\n|7|The Dauntless Youths (Li Zhuozhao, Zhang Kangle)- costume|Sword Rose (Dilraba, Jin Shijia), modern police|\n|8|**Return of the Queen (Zhang Yishang, Wu Junting)- Modern**|Legend of Zang Hai (Xiao Zhan) costume|\n|9|Double Track Piuzzle (Yang Xuwen, Wang Yahui)- modern|**Battlefield Position (Feng Shaofeng, Li Chen)- republican**|\n|10|When Destiny Brings the Demon (A Chen, Wang Yinglu)- costume|ADWAD (Li Yitong, LYN) costume|\n\n# This Week's Highlights\n\n**What to watch?**\n\n**TV Drama**\n\n**Growing Together S2 (Zhang Jiayi, Chen Hao)- modern comedy** \\---- If you want some laugh, we have an outright comedy after a long time. S1 and S2 are not linked, so it is ok to start with S2. But i suggest watch the S1 first. It is a Chinese urban/family drama exploring modern parenting, family life, work–life balance, education pressures, etc.\n\nFor viewers who prefer tighter plots, fewer episodes, or less “everyday realism” and more dramatic escalation, it might feel slow or overly familiar at times.\n\n**Web Drama**\n\n***The Journey of Legend (Cheng Yi, Guli Nazha)***\\---- is a wuxia / fantasy-inspired Chinese drama (2025) featuring transmigration / alternate world / Jianghu elements. There are sects, demonic/heavenly adversaries, ancient conspiracies, etc. It is promising, especially for fans of wuxia / martial arts dramas who enjoy good visuals, sect politics, secret identities, and slower-burn tension. It doesn’t blow everything out of the water immediately- its strengths are more pronounced once the narrative gets rolling- but it seems likely to deliver a satisfying journey especially if you have patience for worldbuilding and complex setups.\n\n**Mobius (Bai Jing Ting, Janice Man)** \\---- is a 2025 Chinese sci-fi / time-loop / detective thriller series. It has 16 episodes. *Mobius* is worth your time if you like: suspense / mystery dramas with sci-fi / supernatural twist. time-loop / reset mechanics that are not just gimmicks but meaningfully engaged with the story. action + thriller elements (gunfights, chase, biotech conspiracies). good production values, decent acting.\n\n***Ranking Process***\\- This has been designed to be the ''Mother of all rankings''. I am using the average of data across Kuyun, Yunhe, Vlinkage, Douban charts, and Datawin. The mean value is recalculated dynamically for each consultant, for each day, and for every drama, for a period of 7 days.\n\n*For further details, please check: Original post (details about ranking and other notes):* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top\\_10\\_cdramas\\_for\\_the\\_week\\_week\\_32/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1mjb204/top_10_cdramas_for_the_week_week_32/)",

In the 1950s, the hospital was transformed into a clothing factory. Although Lin Si Yun's niece Yi Yi dreamed of becoming a clothing designer, she faced dual career and love challenges because of her status as the widow of a Kuomintang officer.\n\nBy the 1990s, this old bungalow had been transformed into a well-known hotel in Shanghai. Yi Yi's granddaughter Ye Xi Ning was originally preparing for her best friend's wedding here, but she was accidentally involved in a conspiracy, &gt;!which caused her to lose her job and bear huge debts, forcing her to join the wave of reform and opening up and face challenges bravely.!&lt;\n\nThree generations spanned sixty years, and each left their own footprints in the tide of the times, witnessing their unyielding strength and courage.\n\n(Source: Chinese = Weibo || Translation = MyDramaList)\n\n[Baidu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%B6%B3%E8%BF%B9/63227644) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/36486134/) | [MDL](https://mydramalist.com/765459-zu-ji) \n\n\n",

Since then I've been looking for something similar, and when scrolling through Douyin I saw an [edit](https://v.douyin.com/CYdxmR26FBQ/) of the movie **The Cord of Life (2023).** It gave the same vibes, so I decided to watch it and I'm glad I did.\n\n&gt;**Synopsis:**\n\n&gt;Musician Arus, dissatisfied with his brother's care for his mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's, resolves to take her back to the grasslands to find the home she remembers. To prevent her from getting lost, Arus ties a rope around their waists. This umbilical cord-like connection forges a wondrous, inverted mother-son bond, drawing them deeper into the grasslands. As love transforms from a bond into understanding and freedom, his mother finally returns to her beloved homeland, and Arus finds peace and the power of love.\n\nWhere TTW takes place in Xinjiang and a lot of the drama is spoken in Kazakh, TCOL takes place in Inner Mongolia and the movie is spoken in Mongolian. Both tell a story of personal growth through the relationship they have with their family and the locals, and how they express themselves through art.\n\nThe actress Badma plays the mom in TCOL, and she was also in TTW.\n\nIf you go look at the credits, it will say that Alima (who plays Token in To The Wonder) stars in this movie and plays the clothing store owner. This is not the case. The role is played by another person who is also named Alima, who is a Mongolian singer and actor. This confused me, so I am putting this here so you aren't confused as well.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if TTW was influenced by TCOL.\n\nIf you haven't seen either, then definitely watch both. **The Cord of Life** is only 1.5hrs, and **To the Wonder** is only 8 episodes.",

    "title": "Journey of Legend [mini review ep 1-23]",
    "content": "Journey of legend is official becoming the journey of a legend because our male lead is finally on his way to becoming the epic legendary martial arts master!! This drama improved so much I'm actually surprised 😭. Like it went from a 7/10 to a 9/10 overnight (7s are dramas I watch for the sake of watching and 9 are my personal favourite 😍 (^.^). The storyline is so much more fun and cohesive and we are finally getting on track! \n\n------------\n\n\n**Some of the positives ❤️ :**\n\n1. **The script** - it's now EPICCCCC\n\n2. **The acting** - I think the actors have finally gotten used to everything because everyone is doing a great job now. Cheng yi seemed a little too emotional at the beginning and now I feel like it was the script that screwed him over because now that we are in a part where everything seems to have settled and we have adjusted I realised that all the actors are doing better now than they were doing at the beginning. And when I say all, I literally mean every single one of the actors. I think the only exception would be the actor playing Yiren (big brother). I hate his character soooooooooo much but he's also the only actor who has been consistent since the beginning though to be fair we didn't see him that much in the first 5 to 8 episodes but ever since he started getting screentime he nailed it!\n\n3. **The fight scenes** - this is something the drama has consistently been good at. I've been watching action and wuxia since I was a kid because my dad is obsessed with them and this has to be few of the only times in the last few years that a drama ACTUALLY SPENT MONEY AND EFFORT on the fight scenes. They are majestic and magical 😍. Seeing them fight feels like seeing a graceful sword dance or sword art (don't know if what I said makes sense) but you also know its a fight. Like, HOW CAN YOU BE SO AGGRESSIVE YET SO GRACEFUL WHILE FIGHTING?!?!?!??! Truly chef's kiss \n\n\n---------\n\n**Ok-ish parts**\n\nA. Nothing looks cheap anymore \n\nB . Character: \n\n  i.  Male lead: After seeing so many cold brooding male leads seeing someone who is playful and smart but not in a scheming way feels like a breath of fresh air! He was too emotional at the beginning but now watching him pushes all my happy buttons. Wouldn't say he's my favourite character but I enjoyed his role\n\n  ii.  The Chief: he's only had a few scenes but dangggg!!!!! This man is aura farming 😭😭😭. Even the way he lifts the freaking brush!!!!!! What is this???? This man gas the permission to step on me (・_・)\n\n   iii. The Chieftess (is that what the subs said?) : she can step on me too because her auraaaaaaaaaa. Honestly we don't know much about her and her husband, the chief yet but the aura they exude is EVERYTHING! (Honestly, should've put the chief couple in the **positive parts** of this reveiw)\n\n iv.  Lu Sifeng: if you're obsessed with Liu Yuning and Liu Xueyi like me and have watched all of their recent dramas you'll realise that this concept in characters is nothing knew and I'm pretty sure it has existed for at least 10 years if not more but I'm just tired of seeing this type of character hehe. I know he's a fan favourite but he's not complex enough for me and only the dark ruthless villain isn't enough to keep my attention. And sometimes he just feels too ruthless for a morally grey character and i dont really like that (its just my personal preference). The chief and the chieftess have an air of mysteriousness around them which makes them more fascinating to watch but Sifeng doesn't have that. If I had to put him in a criteria of how much I enjoy his character he'd be on the same tier as the ml *for me*. \n\n--------------\n\n**The bad**\n\n1. Honestly there's nothing *BAD* anymore but the weakest point of this drama is still how awkward the camera angels are. WHY THE HELL WOULD I WANT TO SEE ANY OF THE CHARACTERS FROM THE POV OF THEIR SHOES????? I said step on me but I DIDNT LITERALLY MEAN IT 😭. Besides that I have no complaints for now.\n\n\n-----------\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nOverall, I'm really enjoying this drama! It's not perfect and has its flaws but it's still a very fun and enjoyable drama for me!\n",

The triad boss seeks revenge for his son, unleashing a bloody storm. Policewoman Tong Hin, however, remains steadfast in upholding justice, relentlessly pursuing the truth.\n\n***\n\n[More details from 南方都市报 Nanfang Dushi Bao](https://m.mp.oeeee.com/oe/BAAFRD0000202409271004306.html):\n\n^(Please note that the character names are translated to the typical spelling for Cantonese names.)\n\nAfter a 20-year hiatus from television dramas, Nick Cheung reunites with Myolie Wu, a decade-long friendship now taking center stage, joining forces with rising actor Joseph Zeng to form the \"new golden trio\" of **Justice Is Mine**.\n\nIn the series:\n\n* Nick Cheung plays Chun Yu, a conflicted character torn between his professional identity and family obligations.  \n* Myolie Wu portrays Tong Hin, a principled police officer grappling with moral dilemmas as darkness encroaches.  \n* Joseph Zeng takes on the role of Hon Lit, a young man forced to suppress his edge for self-preservation – but can he hold onto his convictions as power shifts around him?  \n\nThree complex characters, three distinct acting styles, and three seemingly divergent audience demographics converge in this bold experiment. The creative team aims to break boundaries, crafting a new era of Hong Kong dramas with the broadest possible appeal.  \n\nNotably, mainland actor Joseph Zeng, a native of Shenzhen, Guangdong, naturally exudes a \"Hong Kong vibe,\" seamlessly blending into the Hong Kong drama market. This casting combination is seen as a promising formula for breaking down drama viewing barriers under the new Hong Kong drama model.  \n\n**Justice is Mine** delves into the tangled conflicts of human nature and the struggle for justice. Through its intricate plot and multi-dimensional characters, the series immerses viewers in an investigative journey, uncovering both the righteous and darker sides of humanity.  \n\nA unique aspect of the drama is its use of the audience’s perspective as an entry point, sparking discussion and prompting reflection: Is human nature truly just black and white? Can the law fully encompass moral boundaries? And when societal roles clash with familial duties, what choice is the right one?  \n\nWith enigmatic cases, deeply layered characterizations, and tightly interwoven narratives, the series explores the complexities of human decisions at a profound level. It aims to resonate with audiences while opening new possibilities for deeper integration between Hong Kong and mainland Chinese television.  \n\n[Baidu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%88%8D%E7%8B%97%E4%B9%8B%E8%A1%80/64946817) | [Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37014251/) | [MDL Link](https://mydramalist.com/776187-chu-gou-zhi-xue)\n\n\n\n",

Come Come Come! Let's chat!](https://preview.redd.it/isdf8w0kalqf1.jpg?width=2340&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a7ec43a67eee4acb11e91f01dd0a0ebcbbf8d48)\n\n  \n**\\*Thoughts\\***\n\nCan we address the elephant in the room? What the flying F was that ending in ep 26??? Those 8 men were way way too eager to transfer their left over internal energy to Xiao Cabbage. (My FSH friend Khavien nicknamed Xiao Qiushui \"Cabbage\". Little baby Cabbage :3).\n\n**IT IS ILLOGICAL and against human nature**, especially from the 4 bad people.... and **THAT'S THE POINT**. \n\nWhen Xiao Mimi was discussing this plot point he added to the original story with Sancai, the poor kid was definitely having some 2nd hand embarrassment. \"Yes, I wrote that shit in..... hahaha\". The point is *Fushanhai and their script writer already recognized how campy, cheap and Gary stu that would be but still added it in.* And absurdly the 8 men can't be convinced otherwise. \n\n\n\n**My personal interpretation is that Xiao Mimi is testing the meta world and system.** \n\n\n\nA)- He is testing what is kept or not kept and why. That ridiculous 8 people transferring power to him was not in the OG material but something he added to his fanfiction. The System want him to learn and earn his power hence it killed all his previously too OP buffs in the early episodes but is it now leaving both this one and the convenient Swordman Sancai character. Knowing the system, it would definitely fix it. But it wasn't fix, so why?\n\n  \nB)- R most likely read the OG version but is R aware of his version? Bc no one, beside him, but the system and sancai should know his version as it is unpublished. Did R also wrote his own version and is this a merged version? \n\n  \nC)- Do some NPCs have less agency and free will than others?\n\n\n\nActually a lot of those meta questions is answered by this little experiment.\n\n\n\n**1- He successfully limited The system's meta ability to interfere.** (whether it is because the system promised him upon his success in becoming Sect leader or he actually succeeded in killing it). Whether it still exists as a specific character that can act remains to be seen\n\n\n\n**2- The system can only interfere/modify in real time.** It doesn't seem to be able to intervene in future plot point like a meta writer or programmer. The system is bounded by the time and can only rewrite at the same time as story progression Example: The System knows there is this bs unearned plot line of 8 people transferring energy to him in 4 months (or whatever future). Can The System rewrite the event so it doesn't happen in the future? Or can this System only rewrite at the same time as the story goes.\n\n\n\n**3- R most likely is not a system but another transmigrator**. R probably hasn't read his version, at least not completely. Otherwise why didn't it show up to get this 8-man buff? But he somehow was aware  that there is a copy of the void codex in the Xiao family crypt. Or is the 8-man buff only available to Xiao Qiushui? \n\n  \n**4- Only his Original Characters NPCs have less agency and questionable free will.** (the 8 martial artists, Swordman Sancai). The characters from the original novel are not affected and do seems to retain their own will. \n\nExample: The Sword King was not affected by Xiao Mimi's modified characterization as he is able to deviate from being written as purely loyal to Li Chenzhou and make his own conscious choice to sided with northern wilderness due to self benefits  \n\nThis is an important meta info bc if Xiao Cabbage knew this early on, he wouldn't be tricked by Liu Suifeng as Feng Lang technically doesn't have this range of free will.\n\n\n\n**\\*Theory\\***\n\n  \nXiao Qiushui and Xiao Mingming has always been the same person/soul. This might not be his only transmigration. I think he was originally Xiao Qiushui transmigrating into modern world as Xiao Mimi. It is just that every time, he will slowly loose memories of the world he left behind \n\nI personally think: The more he lives in modern world as Xiao Mimi, the more he forgets the wuxia world along with his old identity as Xiao Qiushui. When he got suck back into the wuxia world, he goes through the same process from Xiao Mimi to Qiushui. Bc in the latest episodes, he tells li Cai that he is starting to forget the modern world. It was also the warning The system gave as it got slashed.\n\nEdit:  one thing I forgot. \n\nXueyu is their **adopted** sister. \n\nWho else but a certain nutcase is missing a sister? \n\n\n  \nThank you everyone for joining me in these discussions. I can't express how much I appreciate you guys.   Thank you!",

Metaphorically, it means that only in difficult and trying circumstances can a person’s strong willpower and moral integrity be truly tested and proven.\n\n",

I started the show thinking oh it feels a big low budget seeing the male lead’s hair and the casting, but the story line developed so nicely and I was surprised with the amount of PDA this show had! A good surprise though! \n\nI loved all the arcs and thought they were unique. I didn’t feel like the show dragged at all. My one complaint is that some of the storylines are not fully fleshed out like at the end we didn’t get to see any of the supporting characters and we didn’t see what happened in the immortal and mortal realm. We also don’t know if Sima Jiao retains anything in modern version him. So while it was a happy ending-ish, I am missing the Story of Kunning Palace’s level of story wrap up. ",

There are some fun bits and I think FL and ML have good chemistry (I personally preferred Lei Cheng in Footprints of Change but I think the different dramas are really showcasing his acting range).\n\nThere are some \\*almost\\* cringe-y aspects to this drama but I can get past them, in fact I find them fun, even endearing, but there is one thing that is driving me ABSOLUTELY NUTS!!\n\nI'm on Ep 25 and &gt;!the FL has just fainted into Prince Li's arms!&lt;. Personally, I love a fainting scene, great drama, and so far the FL's fainted a few times all of which made sense in terms of the plot.\n\nI know it's not real, artistic license and all that, and there are some thing's in dramas I am happy to ignore (e.g. it's bright at nighttime from the 'moon's glow' which is obviously artificial lighting but at least we can see what's going on!) but WHO LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS AND REMAINS COMPLETELY UPRIGHT???\n\nNow, this is not at all a criticism of Song Yi's acting, I think it's great, and I really love the FL I actually think she's quite an interesting character. This piece of direction is literally the only thing that's annoying me!\n\nI wouldn't even have minded an impossibly graceful, definitely unnatural, fall to the ground in whomever's arms but I mean she is LITERALLY standing with her eyes closed and her head 'falls' onto the other person's chest as dramatic music plays.\n\nAnyway, thank you for letting me rant, happy watching! 🩵",

However...falling asleep early means I'm randomly up at like 4:30 so I'm going to start the binge here in a bit.  I'm going to post this up real quick for anyone else who's watched it but I'll come back and update this with my usual commentary after I'm done.\n\nFun Fact: The Earth's rotation speed is varied by latitude, so it's fastest at the equator and barely at the north and south poles. Factors that affect rotation speed mainly have to do with the moon's gravitation pull.  Over the years (talking millions/billions) the pull has been slowing down causing longer days...though in recent years (2020) it's reversed...we're spinning slightly faster and the days are getting slightly shorter.\n\nPrevious Discussions:\n\n[Masterpost ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nj4cqg/mobius_%E4%B8%8D%E7%9C%A0%E6%97%A5_2025_what_are_your_first_impressions/)| [Episode 1-4](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nkhlk4/mobius_episodes_14_discussion/) | [Episodes 5-8](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nlhap6/mobius_episodes_58_discussion/) | [Episodes 9-11 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nmhi3b/mobius_episodes_911_discussion/)|\n\nSpoiler Warning: Remember everything is fair game below this\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\n1. What did you think of the show??\n\nCommentary\n\nEpisode 12\n\nThe fact that WanQing moves her phone just because her mom keeps track of her steps and she doesn't want her mom to worry. :( \n\nOh, interesting, he was exposed to RAN drugs in the lake and that's why he has the ability to loop. \n\nOh no...so the mice died due to early aging? Probably because it's been experiencing more days than the rest...which makes sense, so what does that mean for Ding Qi...\n\nOh so he got the playboy to send the code to him, interesting \n\nSo the lifespan is cut in half :( \n\nSo Mo Yuanzhi is squid...she was freaked out because she saw squid??\n\nOof...so he froze Wanqing\n\nSure...I guess that's one way to deal with dying, make out session.  I think they're still a little cute together, do they have the best chemistry compared to other pairings? No...but that's fine I still think they're cute\n\nSo Mo Yuanzhi is ordering a hit on An Lan \n\nWhy is the loop affecting Ding Qi more than Mo Yuanzhi? Is it because Ding Qi has died more often? \n\nThat's smart, hiding behind the door, guess she would have made too much noise walking or running down the steps \n\nI like this shot for some reason. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/f32nvql6ejqf1.gif\n\nAlso, if she really doesn't have any recollection of loops and he's acting like this...I would find this  all a bit strange that he's just had me go through hoops and then gives me this giant hug when we haven't really had any contact before... \n\nMo Yuanzhi really loved WanQing \n\nEpisode 13\n\nHe really got into it with the squid video \n\n...is he really taking out An Lan's mother? TF\n\nSo...they both know they're loopers and they're going to just act this out like normal.  Why even keep up pretenses, they're saying their same lines but the intensity is so extra lol \n\nOh, so now in the car they aren't even pretending \n\nlol got 'em with the time bomb statement \n\nlol this facial expression \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d128l8z8ejqf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=932dbc7cce8964277be8a664625f416f159e2fa8\n\n\"I just know they're delicious\" \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z7v056hbejqf1.gif\n\nlol the brake check was petty but I'm here for it \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ak54qepdejqf1.gif\n\n💀💀 what a line.  In a previous discussion someone mentioned product placement, there is no greater product placement than this iQiyi Subscription plug lol I'm dead ... also new word for me 会员...member/subscriber lol I too am an iQiyi 会员 lol  Do you think they make the actors pay for the subscriptions? Like hey...sure you're in one of our shows, but please pay our annual fee? I mean, I guess they do right?  No way they would just give out the subscription to actors for free. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tvxb63ofejqf1.gif\n\nSpeaking of which, anyone see the show he's talking about?  Looks like an Anime called Case Closed lol \n\nOh...nice move Ding Qi, I love this battle of wits going on right now to see who can outsmart one another\n\nLook, I know most complain about the romance in this, and I totally agree there's not amazing chemistry, but I still think they're kind of cute.  Like it's not her fault the writers and directors made her a bit flat at first, there's potential there...and come on...this line is cheesy but also in an adorable way. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/gcb0c15jejqf1.gif\n\nThat being said, I don't want romance to be a huge focal point in this show and I'm kind of glad it's not right now.  \n\nInteresting, so you're saying Mo Yuanzhi wasn't a looper at first? \n\nMan this Jiang Yuwen is a trash human \n\nSo did Mo Yuanzhi's compassion and empathy just fly out the window when Feng Wanqing died?  He doesn't seem to care about anyone else, especially An Lan, which if he knew and loved Wanqing, he would have known Wanqing loved An Lan...and he's using her brother to do his dirty work. If Wanqing does get saved and wakes up and finds out about all this, you really think she's going to love you still? \n\nThis exchange made me chuckle...\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/g3lljn5lejqf1.gif\n\nBut also, what is Mo Yuanzhi's final play today?  What exactly is he trying to do today?\n\nInteresting, so the time loops are screwing with Mo Yuanzhi's brain but it's messing with Ding Qi's heart...\n\nSo he's going to file a complaint against Ding Qi? \n\nEpisode 14 \n\nSo...he was testing on homeless people??\n\nOh...is he really testing it on himself? \n\nSo that's how he got Ye Kun on his side...but also it does seem like Ye Kun was a nice enough guy before doing Mo Yuanzhi's dirty work \n\nCome on, I thought her showing him the journal would have convinced him. \n\nWell the 28 days thing might convince him now. \n\nJiang Yuwen used his children to try to get what he wants, good for Tang Xin standing up to her biological father. Now let's figure out Maggie...\n\nSo, is the delivery driver going to actually live??\n\nOhhh look at Ding Qi thinking about the driver who caused the wreck. \n\nI'm a bit sad that I can't screenshot or make gifs of 14-16 because of the restrictions...I would have definitely made a gift of that wink lol\n\nlol I'm calling the police...at the police station...technically he can right? He's no longer a police officer \n\naw, I love the team \n\nThe ok from the girls were cute lol \n\nANSWER HER\n\nOh good, he answered truthfully \n\nSo the question is does Maggie and Tang Xin know they are sisters?\n\nYikes Mo Yuanzhi is not pulling any punches \n\nDude playboy just send it! \n\nUgh playboy you should have just sent the damn video \n\nEpisode 15\n\nContaminated water is the play we're going with huh? \n\nJiang Yuwen kept injecting himself after realizing he was living the loop? Like wouldn't you stop after the 2nd or 3rd loop? \n\nWell, I'll give it to Jiang yuwen, he memorized the lotto numbers to give to his ex rather than himself? Guess that's something\n\nSo how is going to take out Maggie...also are there really not that many cameras in the parking garage to avoid basically all of that confrontation? \n\nOh he just has a remote to turn off cameras? That's convenient...and also...sketch, you can definitely see cameras are turned off if you were to look back at the feed. \n\nThat has to get a little confusing if you're changing the outcome of a loop day, having to remember what happened each loop. \n\nAh yes, we're letting Ding Qi flex his chemistry knowledge \n\nDo people not put passcodes on their phones in this show? \n\nWhy is she just trying random numbers?? \n\nThat room is sealed and it's sucking the oxygen out, no way you're going to find oxygen in the crack\n\nYeah that's not suspicious at all \n\nJiang Yuwen and Mo Yuanzhi are unhinged \n\nLOL they see the gun and immediately scurry?  You telling me they don't have guns as security guards? \n\nWhy is everything always behind a curtian hung randomly on walls in their own apartment? lol \n\nThat was a pretty good distraction, getting out of the car in the garage and still having the driver keep going \n\nWhy did Ding Qi stop at that car specifically? \n\nEpisosde 16\n\nSeems like Jiang Yuwen tried 4 times to prevent Mo Yuanzhi from killing him and finally figured to fake his death on the 5th loop.  Poor Profession Yu saw this 4 times \n\nAw, An Lan did it. Her mom is awake! \n\nDid he hook up the bomb to go off when he dies? \n\nOh...he did \n\nSo is Mo Yuanzhi hitting the wrong spot on purpose or is his brain playing tricks.  \n\nAh...he knew, ok \n\nOk so how do we shut off the bomb connected to this guys pulse.  Also, he made the bomb, can't he just shut it off? Can't he tell them how to shut it off? \n\nAre we going to get a hanging from helicopter scene? \n\nAlright, so we aren't pully a Jackie Chan helicopter scene \n\n☠️☠️☠️☠️ it was so intense and then...comedy. LOL Ding Qi's response...\"Go ahead\" LOL I'm dying \n\nI'm sorry, I absolutely love the exchange/dialog between the two of them. \n\nI knew it...All that build to lead to this moment right? \n\nI couldn't beat you so I had to play dirty\n\n\"Go easy on me\" lol \n\n...not bad, you've worked out during your loop days lol \n\nAlso he keeps clutching his stomach, that's not his heart \n\nAs he's dying he still manages to handcuff Mo Yuanzhi...win one for Ding Qi. \n\nDude stepping on him and we're going to count that as CPR? lol \n\nIs Mo Yuanzhi about to go all 127 hours on us? Or I guess maybe on Ding Qi? \n\nGuys that is not how you do chest compressions!!! My former medical training is screaming \n\nI will admit, this background music over everyone is still pretty impactful, I'm tearing up over here, props to the actors in this scene, the editing, and how it's shot.  \n\nI'm surprised he didn't ask what day it was. \n\nY'all this hospital scene is giving me LOTR Frodo wakes up vibes lol Please tell me you see it \n\nLOL the heart thing from the girls \n\nLOL \"I was shy, but I accepted it\" I do actually think they are cute together\n\nI love the team ribbing him lol \n\nYay the delivery driver is alive \n\nlol this team is great\n\nOverall thoughts: \n\nY'all this was good, I really enjoyed it.  I was definitely seated for all the episodes. Can we get more episodes of just the team working together?  Like this is set up for a season 2 right? lol Please???",

(Before my last hiatus I stopped like a third of the way through Eternal Love but then picked it up a few years later LMAO). Meanwhile as I go through threads I’m seeing that people drop dramas all the time - so if you are someone who does this, which dramas did you finish (and love) and what about it got you through?\n\n(And maybe this discussion isn’t great for me to see because I’m easily influenced by others’ comments and opinions LOL. Something might not initially bother me, but someone will point it out and that’s when I think, \"ah yes... this is indeed weird\". Maybe at the end of the day I just haven’t watched enough dramas yet, but this is why I prefer to hold off on reading comments until after I’m done with a show. On the flip side, there are few dramas that I can say that I have REALLY loved. I often finish dramas without having strong feelings. But that is perhaps a different can of worms.)",

However, we all know tree rings are real.

The coral one is new to me, I actually didn't know that and it's true.

Was that a burn mark? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hue46lrtrfqf1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2a37624a0901a9c6ea7c88085249b423cd2083c\n\nThe other chief's mandarin is definitely a Cantonese speaker's mandarin lol \n\nInteresting...so I'm guessing Professor You saw Mo Yuanzhi kill Professor Jiang but I bet you it was one of the loops...so Mo Yuanzhi probably has the ability to loop and somehow Professor You's partial recollection of that loop day stuck with only the image of him killing someone because it was such a jarring memory, just like everyone who dies has a dream of their death...it must be something super impactful to \"remember\" something from the loop day. \n\nWait, so she married him knowing he doesn't love her? Why enter the marriage...business arrangement?  Did she ever love him? Or did she not know he didn't love her at first? Why is this integral to the story?  Was he using her and her family to establish Moma?  Did he kill off the other two because he wants all of Moma for himself? Did I miss the fact somewhere in the earlier episodes? \n\nAn Lan's bestie had cancer and was in a clinical study? So An Lan joined Moma to find out what happened to her...did Mo Yuanzhi fall for her bestie? So many questions right now but I do love that the pieces are slowly coming together...\n\nIt's a common thing in these suspense dramas but man I was so worried for An Lan getting caught, literally at the edge of my seat.  lol \n\nAh so yes to all my questions, he married her for her family and money. Anyone else worried while he was hugging her in bed that he was about to kill her? \n\nYikes...then she goes and asks if he's the killer\n\nWait, why did he pass out? Is it when you randomly share the same space as another looper? Why did he randomly die?\n\nInteresting, so he's manipulating the situation so that the wife can make it inside. Does he know that she's following him? \n\nWait, her mom is awake now? Or did he give her enough warning. Aw...at least she got to see her mom and her mom got to see her.\n\nLol does Ding Qi really think just not explaining things will fly \n\nInteresting...who does she see? I'm guessing it's An Lan's bestie...or maybe it's a disfigured person? Why does she seem so spooked \n\nI love this BTS to a historical fight scene lol \n\nStill curious why she is so spooked \n\nSo is picking locks a skill he's picked up from looping at some point? Lol \n\nMo Yuanzhi is being creepy...also why would you follow him in your own car when you realize he will notice you were home and then also gone when he gets home? What excuse are you going to give? Like this whole exchange is strange \n\nI don't know if Ye Kun is the looper, seems like a set up \n\n\n\nEpisode 10\n\n2016 in America...Maggie being suspicious already...were those numbers like insider trading? So...Maggie is benefiting from a looper and maybe she's now an accomplice? \n\nSo originally he saw 6 firefighters go in and 7 come out. That is a very good observation, he's definitely honed his skills over the years. Probably the fact he has to memorize details from loop to another \n\nSo his mom was strict, that's a random text to make a kid memorize \n\nInteresting, Mo Yuanzhi is the same this morning as the first two loops. \n\nOh yay, look at the delivery driver doing something different this loop\n\nLOL\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp7itnb5sfqf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63804af6c2e4f9d64783287633d884ddd5c64545\n\nThe heart \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cipdx1e6sfqf1.gif\n\nOh...what if Maggie is Jiang YuWen's kid? The numbers her mom had were from Jiang Yuwen to win the lotto/invest \n\nSo Maggie isn't a looper but I bet you Jiang Yuwen is her dad and tells her what to do.\n\nSo since she saw whatever she saw in the lab, she changed her vote this loop \n\nWhat is in that secret lab?\n\nI like that the doctor calls out An Lan.  \n\nPoor Wan Qing\n\nOh...Tang Xin is the daughter \n\nOh another daughter...bet you it's Maggie\n\nYikes, whatever the wife saw really freaked her out \n\nI was right, Maggie is the daughter \n\nLOL good ol' Cantonese curse to end this episode, love it though the subtitle in Chinese isn't correct and that also makes me laugh.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ruw2qu99sfqf1.jpg?width=2799&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a2ad4636a00c148057c18e674d922c2ced426df\n\nEpisode 11\n\n2008, 15 years later...2023? \n\nlol Wan Qing\n\nLook at Mo Yuanzhi being fun \n\nSeems like Wan Qing is who he really loved \n\nSo someone ran into Fang Lu and made her crash? \n\n...Yes let's go into a sketchy abandoned hospital \n\n...is this dude going to blow up this hospital? Or is he there to kill her? Weird, why \n\nInteresting twist that he's Wan Qing's brother? \n\nThat zip tie on her feet sure were super easy to get off lol \n\n...what a choreography sequence right here, especially with the dodging the gun part  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/d7gfejtcsfqf1.gif\n\nDude, come on, he just said he wanted to talk and you take out a knife. \n\nWhy do I randomly think this bandaging and grabbing glass scene is so cool and badass? lol I'm probably just weird \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/4rl6dd2esfqf1.gif\n\nFang Lu quite literally jumping the gun again \n\nSo, 3 people dead...meaning they did blow up? Or just faking it?  It was at zero and didn't blow up exactly then\n\nAh yes, fake death\n\nAn Lan looks like she's mad at Ding Qi for killing her bestie's brother.  But surely she realized he was trying to kill Ding Qi and was going to kill her too \n\nGuess it wasn't mad at him look, just a look about what she had just found out\n\nDid she just fall asleep from shock and exhaustion? \n\nWHAT DID SHE SEE, seriously, what did she see lol She's so upset \n\nIt does sound crazy to just admit he remembers time loops and can change them...but then she matches the crazy by doing this\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/et3z5kphsfqf1.gif\n\nlol indeed bringing home her mice \n\nInteresting, so you're saying it's not just humans, some animals have the ability to loop \n\nThat's crazy! I can't wait till we get all the episodes tomorrow. \n\nI've actually been avoiding the trailers since this show is so short, but I'm tempted to watch the trailers for the next few episodes.  Anyway, my daughter's birthday is actually tomorrow but it should be a bit more low key.  Like I said, I'll put up a generic 12-16 episode post tomorrow but then come back and post my thoughts in case y'all do finish before me and you want a place to discuss the show.  ",

Cause I have a strong feeling that squid is &gt;!Maggie!&lt; \n\nAlso what did Yu Shiya see that made her so frightened 🤔 my best guess would be that Mo YuanZhi took An Lan's best friend (I can't remember her name) and kept her for all those years as experiment cause he liked her and couldn't bear to see her die? If that is the case then that is seriously twisted...\n\nAn Lan has been removed from my suspect list now though cause I feel she came to Moma to find out about her best friend since she disappeared \n\nWe are seeing more secrets of Mo YuanZhi get revealed for every loop and my opinion of him gets worse everytime... He used Yu Shiya for her family and to boost his reputation, made he fall madly in love with him only for him to treat her coldly after marriage 🥲 that is so shitty and messed up if you ask me\n\nAlso you guys I'm seriously so scared for Ding Qi cause it looks like the loop is taking a tool on him and the way he fainted in that lab at the end of the 3rd loop was so scary 😞 also seeing him running around and getting all stressed cause the loops are now so different is really painful to watch but at least we are getting new clues that are so helpful to the investigation \n\nLastly I'm really curious on what happened to Jiang Yuwen and where he is now\n\nAll in all I can say that this drama has me HOOKED and enjoying every bit 😆",

    "content": "#Be Yourself | 逆天成仙\n\n[Be Yourself](https://mydramalist.com/778546-be-yourself) is a mini-drama that aired between May and June of this year (2025).\n\n**And I cannot believe I haven't heard anyone here talk about it yet** \n\n(Not saying that no one mentioned it, just saying that I didn't see it) \n\nIt is **amazing**\n\n#The Premise \n\nThe most accomplished Martial Arts Master of all the realms faces his Thunder Tribulations. Unfortunately for him, the dragon seems to have something against him and instead of 12 bolts of lightning, this guy has to face 99. Well, the real number is actually unknown because it's on bolt 99 that he perishes. \n\nHe wakes up in the body of a \"useless\" cultivator. Yet, his Thunder Tribulation seems to have worked - he still has an electric touch. \n\nMeaning that even without all his previous cultivation, he is still the most powerful being around. \n\nI'm not going to mention much more about the story, just know that there are few things as satisfying as people underestimating such a powerful character.\n\n#The Music\n\nI can't talk about this drama without mentioning the music.\n\nIf ever there was a \"I'm super powerful and badass\" theme song, well, it would be [this one](https://youtu.be/nKSiZsL-tAM?si=FQQfyW41DRxGZb3-). \n\n*(And Fangs of Fortune)*\n\n#The Characters \n\nI was very sceptical of the ML at first. I thought the drama might end up more slapstick comedy than anything else, but I was wrong. \n\n[Pan Lu Yu](https://mydramalist.com/people/50953-pan-lu-yu), the ML,  did such a wonderful job portraying a character who for all intents and purposes, should be arrogant and high and mighty, but instead just does not care what anyone thinks. (He's still arrogant though). \n\nThe four female characters are strong and each have their own personality. There is one that I find specifically special but I won't say much more because I don't want to spoil anything.\n\n#Should You Watch It?\n\n**YES**\n\nI just feel like I should mention to those who like romance, this isn't romance, but it's still an absolutely amazing drama that I would highly encourage everyone to watch.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of *Dashing Youth* ",

Then he sees her and walks up to her, they have their little exchange of words and he smiles at her.!&lt;\n\nBut here are my questions:\n\nIn the beginning of episode 1 he states &gt;!that is he going to change his destiny and at the night of the new moon the mountain will no longer bind him and he will be free but that he needs one last piece. That’s when, in the modern world,  the lightning takes out a traffic light, she gets into the accident, and is now transported into the past. Did he foresee this?!&lt;\n\nIn the modern world, &gt;!he was told that there still was one more person who was coming with a proposal. He only knew her as Liao Tingyan in the past. But her name in the modern world was Zou Yan. When he asked his assistant if there were any more proposals, the assistant said Zou Yan from Serene Mountain project was requested. I think he did have his memories and at that point knew it was her and decided not to get on the plane. I think he made the connection to the modern Serene Mountain and the sect she was from in the past. So he had the cup of coffee and waited. But how did he know she would actually show up? Can he see the future? How did he know that she was going to be late instead of not showing up at all?!&lt;\n\nHow did &gt;!he know it was her if all he saw was her back? Was it because he heard her talking about the Wine? Because he did look up after she talked to herself.!&lt;\n\nSo those are my questions 😂 I really enjoyed the drama. There was a few hard parts to watch where I bawled, but overall I liked their chemistry and it was one of my favorite dramas of 2025. I think I may rewatch down the road! \n\n",

    "title": "Comedy in cdrama",
    "content": "Just finished A Dream Within a Dream, and it made me think that we don't talk enough about how extremely funny cdramas can be. Only time I've seen a real discussion about it was when Filter was airing, but overall I think 2025 has been a pretty good year for light-hearted dramas that manage to be extremely funny. Guardians of the Dafeng (started in 2024 but aired in early 2025 as well), Perfect Match, Filter, A Dream Within a Dream, Love of the Divine Tree (surprisingly light-hearted and comedic for an angsty xianxia where the characters are spitting blood every 5 minutes).\n\nOf course humor is very subjective, but personally I've found that the cdramas I find truly funny are some of the most hilarious stuff I've ever watched. I rarely laugh out loud when watching/reading something funny, even when I do find it very funny it mostly gets a chuckle out of me, but a lot of cdramas have made me literally scream with laughter. When watching Guardians of Dafeng and A Dream Within a Dream I started wondering if the neighbors would think I'd gone made or something, that's how loud and frequently the dramas made me laugh.\n\nNot to say that the cdrama humor always land for me, sometimes I just find the comedic bits kind of average, or even misplaced, and I think some cdramas really suffer from tonal problems where they try to be both funny and serious and end up failing at both. \n\nBut it's only with cdramas that I've seen angsty or dramatic plotlines that hook me on the story and make me emotional getting paired with extremely silly comedy bits, but both end up working really well. It seriously baffles me how they do it. \n\nA lot of actors seem quite versatile in that aspect, and even those whose strength is mostly in playing more serious characters often manage to be quite funny if given the right script, directing and co-stars. \n\nI think a lot of what works well with cdrama humor is how it's not afraid to lean heavily into slapstick and extremely silly, non-sensichal scenes and plot lines, and still retain a lot of self-awareness. It's something I've noticed in Chinese webnovels as well, were there's a lot of playfullness and meta humor, being extremely aware of cliches and then shamelessly use them for laughs. Of course, drama humor can also be pretty extreme, and I've seen some people take offense of how violent the comedic scenes get sometimes, or violence or trauma played for laughs, so I think the truly comedic cdramas aren't for the faint at heart.\n\nThe best comedic cdramas I've watched (totally subjective opinion of course):\n\n* Guardians of the Dafeng - extremely silly and so many jokes that at one point it felt contrived, but still managed to make me laugh in pretty much every episode, even the ones with very serious and emotional scenes. \n* A Dream Within a Dream - I think this drama sets the record for how many meta jokes roasting the cdrama industry you can cram into a few episodes. My favorite was probably when&gt;! the FL jumps off a cliff with the ML (who's terrified and think they're going to die) because as she says 'no leads in a drama ever dies from falling off a cliff' !&lt;\n* Go Princess Go! - the craziest drama I've ever watched. The viagra commercial was probably the highlight along with the&gt;! insane training montage with a bare chested ML and the FL thirsting over him as he does push-ups.!&lt; Made me go 'WTF am I watching?!' so many times.\n* Never Give Up: Extremely funny office satire. Highlight is when two main characters &gt;!start doing the dance from Tarantino's Pupl Fiction.!&lt;\n* My Girfriend's Boyfriend: Tongue-in-cheek BL drama where they took the FL in directions that were unexpected but hilarious. Plus the nerd references (and the one about A Song of Ice and Fire is funny considering it's made back in 2017).\n* The Romance of Tiger and Rose: When &gt;!the FL pretends she's been poisoned and has literal violins playing when the ML finds her 'dying'.!&lt;\n\nSome dramas that I found funny and entertaining, but not primarily comedies or comedies but not ones that had me roaring with laughter:\n\n* Love Between Fairy and Devil: the comedic bits with the body swap and the ML &gt;!being forced to do the FL's bidding!&lt; is very funny. Made me appreciate Yu Shuxin and Wang Hedi so much I went on to watch several of their other dramas. \n* Love Like the Galaxy: everything with the emperor, but also the ML &gt;!trying to socialize with the FL's family over a meal, and everyone thinking his very awkwardly told joke is a veiled threat to them all.!&lt;\n* Filter: The poor ML being repeatedly traumatized was actually pretty damn funny.\n* Day of Becoming You: another body swap done really well.\n* Love Game in Eastern Fantasy: The FL dying over and over was hilarious, and Yu Shuxin made it even funnier, she has great comedic timing.\n* Mr Bad: Chen Zheyuan is very funny as a 'villain', especially when he falls in love.\n* Story of Kunning Palace: wasn't a big fan of this drama nor of the leads, but &gt;!the FL falling over and the ML saving his qin instead of her!&lt; made me laugh. Had some nice humor in the first part.\n* Love of the Divine Tree: The ML being a cat, a tsundere and extremely petty was probably the highlights of watching this drama - along with the supporting comic relief male character who was a lovable asshole and someone I desperately needed to have a happy ending (despite him totally not deserving one)\n* Perfect Match: The 5th sister beating up her love interest (and his evil family) repeatedly - not for the easily offended (domestic violence and all), but I found it hilarious (and he was an asshole at first - and I suspect quite into it at the end) \n\nThere are way more dramas worth mentioning, since it seems most cdrama try to balance even very serious plotlines with some comedic scenes to diffuse the tension. These are just the ones that stuck in my memory.\n\nWhich other cdramas do you think were made more memorable/worth watching because of the comedy?\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "The Journey of Legend: honest review up to Ep 22",
    "content": "I know the expectations were high for this drama for several reasons like as it is produced by both iQiyi and Tencent, and it is a big budget production. Personally, I found it \"just okay\" in the first few episodes but now I am invested because the plot keeps getting better, thus I've watched it up to EP 22 (the latest episode). Some of the common feedbacks people had during the beginning started making sense when you start watching it in \"detective mode\". You need to look out for clues in the first few episodes because they are so easy to miss and without context, it feels confusing and conflicting. In addition, the plot twists make more sense if you catch the clues scattered throughout the episodes.\n\nHere are some of the key points I think people need to know when watching this because it really changes how you view it. It does contain spoilers, please read at your own discretion.\n\n1. **XMM transmigrated as XQS**&gt;!**inside a game setting, not a novel.**!&lt;\n\n* &gt;!Based on EP 1, it is mentioned that the AI system is in a \"internal/ beta testing\" phase during the conversation of XMM and Li Cai. They were creating a game out of a novel material. Beta testing means that there are multiple players involved to do the testing and it is a common practice in the gaming industry.!&lt;\n* &gt;!Some of the character/plot changes made by XMM are retained (eg. Xue Yu being his adopted sister). XMM can only remember the changes he made and he does not remember all the plot details of the original novel.!&lt;\n* If we view the drama with the &gt;!gaming!&lt; aspect in mind, some of the events in the following episodes would make sense. &gt;!{SPOILER: an example would be the system restart as shown in EP 15-16. The restart is similar to respawn in gaming, where the player gets revived and their health is restored to a 100% upon death. XMM probably realized that he can't die and is stuck on an infinite loop since he experienced mutiple reboots / restarts already.}!&lt;\n\n**2. The \"inconsistency\" of the ML**\n\n* Some viewers felt that Cheng Yi's acting was confusing, with questions like \"why does some of the ML's actions don't make sense?\", \"why is he suddenly emotionally invested when Tang Rou died?\" and \"why does the ML act like another person sometimes (his reaction / actions don't match XMM's personality)?\"\n* Before we explore those \"inconsistencies\", what happened to the original XQS? Because I think this question is one of the keys in understanding the plot.\n\nWhat we know:\n\n&gt;!The AI system did state that the system bug is because the changes XMM made was OCC. As for the status of the original XQS, it is currently unknown whether he is dead or alive.!&lt;\n\nWhat we can infer:\n\n* Possibility #1: &gt;!The souls of the original XQS and XMM were switched, thus the original XQS is currently in the modern world.!&lt;\n* Possibility #2: &gt;!The original XQS died when XMM took over the body, because a soul needs to possess a physical body.!&lt;\n* Possibility #3: &gt;!2 souls in 1 body. EP 22 is the closest that we confirm that this is a possibility. I almost didn't notice it because Cheng Yi's acting was very layered. When XMM/XQS found the hero's token, he was having an inner monologue with the slight changes in tone, as if there are 2 people are conversing. There a bits of hints here and there in the previous episodes, such as the XMM's fragmented dreams (or rather memories that either resulted from experiencing dealth multiple times or are memories of the original XQS). !&lt;\n\nSo with these key points in mind, the plot thickens and I am excited for the twists that lie ahead. It's not a simple as I thought it was, so please do give it a chance! I certainly found myself intrigued, so I'll watch it until the end.\n\nSide note: Seeing Cheng Yi as Li Chen Zhou does remind me of Xuan Ye from Immortal Samsara but they give different vibes. Even when he is acting as XMM, XQS and LCZ, you know who is who! I am also eagerly awaiting the fight scene of \"Cheng Yi\" (as XMM/XQS) vs \"Cheng Yi\" (LCZ) again. Think Xuan Ye vs Ying Yuan in Immortal Samsara and the real Sifeng vs the fake one in Love and Redemption.",

    "content": "# Welcome to Fushanhai/Go to the Mountains and Seas/ The Journey of Legend discussion \n\nThis post covers episodes 13-20. (spoilers for those episodes will be in abundance and encouraged) \n\nI am aware that the show is presently aired to **episode 22.** Feel free to discuss episodes **21-22 with SPOILER TAGS**\n\n[Ep 1-6](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nflil9/the_journey_of_legendgo_to_the_mountains_and_seas/)\n\n[Ep 7-12](https://www.reddit.com/r/CDrama/comments/1nh381y/the_journey_of_legend_go_to_the_mountains_and/)\n\nHello Everyone,\n\nGoing forward, I will no longer provide lore and episode summaries in these discussions but only my thoughts, theories and observations. (and perhaps some personal opinions). I think we are way beyond the point where it is worthwhile to read summaries rather than watch the show. Episode 13 forward was amazing and I don't think text could do it justice.\n\nCredit to my friend Khavien for some of these images\n\n[Welcome to Fushanhai Discussion! Have some tea while we chat :3](https://preview.redd.it/zev3nbf4d9qf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cf7a2f76482933a864665f9d59f6fd761a77f82)\n\n **\\*Thought\\***\n\n**Xiao brothers** (Purple = Yiren, Blue = Kaiyan)\n\nQiushui has always love his brothers more than they love him.\n\n[It is Chinese custom to be buried in white. Xiao Qiushui came prepared.](https://preview.redd.it/acvj79qcf9qf1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=694cf7e1bdf11c4c95ece7f871a162430fc3e0de)\n\nWell, we are all aware of what happened in episode 14... But still allow me to express my disappointment in Xiao Yiren, both in episode 14 and 18. He seems to want be portray chivalry (both in his proper manners and speech) but never truly understood true chivalry and it feels a little like posturing. It is truly laughable that he expects to be able to demand chivalry from others in return. Jianghu has always been a mix of chivalry and backstabbing for self interest. You can only take what is being offered. You can't even be sure what is being offered is genuine and not a trap (think the fake Du sect leader offering to teach Xiao Mimi swordsmanship only to have that being used to frame him). Having been in Jianghu for so long but with so little understanding Jianghu, let along human nature, Xiao Yiren, what have you been doing these past years beside hiding behind your father's achievements?\n\nWhen even Shaolin/Wudang sect leaders, Xiao Xilou, Gu Junshan and most obviously himself have been fooled by a Power gang member, who is he Xiao Yiren to blame little Qiushiu?\n\nI like the initial description of Xiao Kaiyan, quiet and steady. In other words : follower.\n\nI especially like how they contrast Jindu's Wulin leaving the Xiao elder brothers to rot in their own problems while Guanling's Wulin voluntarily stayed for Xiao Mimi. Episode 18-20 is a little bit more comforting. Chivalry and gratitude is still alive in Wulin, they just arrived a little too late.\n\n[Horses are too expensive to rent](https://preview.redd.it/zqteshmnd9qf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=519074cfd8c5ca9f53d94a14d8a32278c210e4fe)\n\n[Not for Qu Hanshan apparently \\(heavenly Sword king\\)](https://preview.redd.it/tv6vtm4td9qf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f78e2bc308ddcadadb8810630ec1b31768aa045)\n\nInitially, I felt that all those extra characters doesn't bring much fun banter and we can't connect with them (unlike the trio in MLC). But perhaps they are purposefully written flawed this way. We are not supposed to connect with them just as Qiushui can't truly connect with them even though he tried. There was truly never any respect as they are too absorbed in their self importance. Of course this being Jianghu is probably foreshadowing further conflict.\n\n**Liu Suifeng**\n\nThat scheme in ep 13-14, well done Liu Suifeng. The hints were there. I knew something was wrong when the camera pan to that dried up corpse lying in the dungeon.\n\nI can't help but laugh a bit at him scowling at Xiao Mimi. \"You were supposed to stay put until I pick you up, just wait for your brothers leave. WTF was that, I had to rush to save you\". \"How do you not know why I'm not eating too! Think boy!\"\n\n[The Wife cooked for you. Be grateful.](https://preview.redd.it/jqzs3as4e9qf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04b9f8953d610d33e21c4641e5a08ad13acc344b)\n\n[\\*inwardly smug\\*](https://preview.redd.it/i52qnhqee9qf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73f08f59ae06c492ed437fa23f21a2e4c89cba68)\n\nThe fun banter is back. I think Xiao Mimi worked hard convincing Liu Suifeng (and whoever is spying on them) that he doesn't have the Token. How hasn't that wooden bed collapse yet?\n\nNow, I've heard how Liu Suifeng saving him is a poor excuse to have him alive. Fair criticism. It is reeking a little bit of conveniently MC halo. But although a bad kid, Liu Suifeng doesn't strike me as a rat (or little person as they say it in Chinese). He seems to have his own set of moral code and returning debt is pretty high up there with how dedicated he is to Li Chenzhou bc the latter saved him. So perhaps, this is his way of paying back for how Xiao Qiushui saved him from Sword king's assailants and cured his poison. Dude just have a resting b\\*tch face.\n\nokay, As fun as all that ep 16 banter is, Am I the only one that was disappointed that he didn't get maimed by Qiushui in ep 18. With each blow, I was hoping Qiushui would slash heavier, stab deeper. Reform Liu Suifeng? Oh you mean rearrange his face?\n\n**Xiao Qiushui**\n\nSometimes, I can't help but think that Xiao Qiushiu is and will suffer more than Li lianhua (MLC). Ep 14: well, that was a public humiliation and betrayal from love one.\n\n[Xiao Qiushui, why are you baby sitting again?](https://preview.redd.it/a6ez1ihte9qf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d536b85a1b6a97c45ee790caa426ac24a1298325)\n\n**Tang Fang**\n\nI'm starting to really like her. Considering how negative my previous appraisal of her in ep 7-12 discussion is, Hats off to the script writer &amp; Li Kaixin.\n\n**\\*Theories\\***\n\nThings are starting to get interesting. I don't think we have seen all the scheming parties. Old lady tang, Emei, Waterway King, Crazy Ya, Northwildness, the emperor (a bit through prince liang) and etc. One thing I'm really starting to appreciate is that there are multiple people scheming against each other (This is how a proper Wuxia/Jianghu should be). Liu Suifeng appears all in control dealing with the Xiao family/Xiao Mimi but Sword king also has his own scheme against Liu Suifeng. Kang Chuyu whom the Sword king keeps at his side actually works for Hoodie. \n\nAt first, I though perhaps the man in the hood is Crazy Yan. However, when he met up with Kang Chuyu asking for the Hero token, I am back to doubting bc why would Crazy Yan be looking for the token he gave away. (please don't let it be Crazy Yan bc we all think it is)\n\n**\\*A little halfway Review\\***\n\nDespite its flaws (thanks director &amp; post production team), I really do appreciate how they attempt have us experience with Xiao Mimi his losses, fall from grace and subsequent rise. I can say that Xiao Mimi truly earns his allies &amp; power ups and justifies his vindictiveness.\n\nThere is definitely some pacing flaws. I'm not sure I like them using the transmigration tropes. The show starts to get good when they tone down that whole system/transmigration things. But it has been a long long time since I last rooted so much for the main character (rather than the handsome melancholic antagonist with a sob story).\n\nThank you everyone for keeping me company throughout this Journey. I am having so much fun in these discussions! Thank you!",
