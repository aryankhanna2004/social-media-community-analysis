I also check around 30 camera ready NeurIPS papers that got uploaded to arXiv, and only one put the checklist before appendices (although most of the accepted paper don't even include checklist on arXiv version.)\n\nI'm just want to check if anyone have any idea how strict these instruction will be? If I put the checklist after appendices, will I get 'reject'? (I guess the chance is very small but just want to double-check). ",

    "title": "My experience deploying an ML-driven trading system [P]",
    "content": "Years back, after finishing my CS degree, I got into algorithmic trading as a personal project. It felt like the perfect arena to push my skills in coding, data science, and, most importantly, data engineering. After a long road of development, I recently deployed my first fully automated, ML-driven system.\n\nThe trading results aren't the point of this post. I'm here to talk about the steps I've taken to solve the fundamental problem of getting a machine learning model to perform in a live environment exactly as it did during historical testing.\n\nA live production environment is hostile to determinism. Unlike a sterile backtest where all data is known, a live system deals with a relentless, ordered stream of events. This introduces two critical failure modes:\n\n* **Lookahead Bias:** The risk of accidentally using information from the future to make a decision in the past. A live system must be architected to be a strict \"tape reader,\" ensuring it only ever acts on information that has already occurred.\n* **State Drift:** A more insidious problem where the system's internal \"memory\"—its representation of the world, built from the stream of incoming data—slowly but surely drifts away from the ground truth of the historical environment. The live model ends up seeing a distorted reality compared to the one it was trained on, rendering its predictions meaningless.\n\nIt's important to note that training a model on features containing lookahead bias will often *cause* state drift, but not all state drift is caused by lookahead bias. My entire development process was engineered to prevent both.\n\nMy first principle was to enforce a strict, row-by-row processing model for all historical data. There are countless ways lookahead bias can creep into a feature engineering pipeline, but the most tempting source I found was from trying to optimize for performance. Using vectorized pandas operations or multi-threading is standard practice, but for a stateful, sequential problem, it's a minefield. While I'm sure there are pandas wizards who can vectorize my preprocessing without causing leaks, I'm not one of them. I chose to make a deliberate trade-off: I sacrificed raw performance for provable correctness.\n\nMy solution is a \"golden master\" script that uses the *exact same stateful classes* the live bot will use. It feeds the entire historical dataset through these classes one row at a time, simulating a live \"tape reader.\" At the end of its run, it saves the final state of every component into a single file. While this is much slower than a vectorized approach, it's the cornerstone of the system's determinism.\n\nThe live bot's startup process is now brutally simple: it loads the state file from the golden master. It doesn't build its own state; it *restores* it. It only has to process the short data gap between the end of the golden master's run and the current moment. This makes the live system easier to debug and guarantees a perfect, deterministic handover from the historical environment.\n\nFinally, I have the validator. This tool also starts from the same \"golden master\" state and re-processes the exact same raw data the live bot saw during its run. The goal is a Pearson correlation of 1.0 between the live bot's predictions and the validator's predictions. Anything less than a perfect correlation indicates a logical divergence that must be found and fixed.\n\nThis project has been an incredible learning experience, but the biggest lesson was in humility. The most complex challenges weren't in model architecture but in the meticulous data engineering required to create a provably consistent bridge between the historical and the live environments.\n\nWhile my actual trading models are private, I have a lower-frequency version of the system that posts market updates and predictions. After running live for over three weeks, it maintained a &gt;0.9999 correlation with its validator - shown in the attached picture. It's currently offline for some upgrades but will be back online in a few days. You can see it here:\n\n[https://x.com/ZtenlEssej](https://x.com/ZtenlEssej)\n\nThanks for reading. I have high hopes for my trading system, but it will take time. For now my skills are very much for hire. Feel free to reach out if you think I could be a fit for your project!",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm starting a project to train a reinforcement learning agent that can operate a desktop computer, with the eventual goal of performing multi-step tasks. I have a good grasp of RL theory but I'm hitting a wall trying to find a suitable environment to actually train and benchmark my agent.\n\nI'm looking for something that mimics a real desktop interaction, but in a controlled setting. Here’s a breakdown of what I need:\n\n**1. Observation Space:**  \nThe observation should be a representation of the current screen state. I'm open to different approaches:\n\n* **Pixel-based:** A screenshot of the desktop/virtual machine. This is the most general form.\n* **DOM/HTML-based:** If the environment is web-focused, the HTML source code of the current page would be a fantastic, more structured alternative to pixels.\n* **Accessibility Tree:** Something like the UI hierarchy from Windows' UI Automation or Apple's Accessibility APIs would also be great.\n\n**2. Action Space:**  \nThe agent needs to perform low-level actions, similar to a human user:\n\n* **Mouse:** Move to (x, y) coordinates, left/right/middle click, click-and-drag, scroll.\n* **Keyboard:** Send keystrokes (both text and special keys like `ENTER`, `TAB`).\n\n**3. The Crucial Part: A Benchmark Suite**  \nThis is where I'm really struggling. I don't just need an empty environment; I need a **curated set of tasks** to define success and measure progress. Ideally, this would be a suite of tasks with a clear reward signal.\n\n**Example tasks I have in mind:**\n\n* **Web Tasks:**\n   * \"Log into Gmail.\"\n   * \"Search for a product on Amazon and add it to your cart.\"\n   * \"Find the contact email on a company's 'About Us' page.\"\n* **Desktop Application Tasks:**\n   * \"Open a text editor, write a sentence, and save the file to the desktop.\"\n   * \"Create a new calendar event for tomorrow at 3 PM.\"\n\nI've looked at environments like `miniwob++`, which is a great start and almost exactly what I need for web tasks, but I'm wondering if there's anything more robust, more modern, or that extends beyond the browser to the full desktop OS.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Does a ready-to-use environment like this already exist? (e.g., a \"DesktopGym\" or \"WebShoppingSuite-v0\"?)\n2. If not, what would be the best way to build one? Is it better to create a virtual machine and use image-based observations, or is there a framework for hooking into a browser/OS to get a more structured observation space?\n3. Are there any known research projects or benchmarks that have tackled this specific problem of a general desktop agent?\n\nAny pointers to papers, GitHub repos, or existing projects would be immensely appreciated.

    "content": "I've been working on a project to extract structured data (entities and sentiment) from noisy, unstructured text from Reddit and wanted to share the methodology, as it uses a hybrid approach that some of you might find interesting. The goal was to build a robust pipeline that could balance the speed of traditional search with the discovery capabilities of an LLM.\n\n**The 5-Phase Pipeline Architecture**\n\nThe system processes text in five distinct phases:\n\n1. **Phase 1: High-Speed Fuzzy Matching:** The first pass uses Fuse.js to perform a fuzzy search against a pre-populated database of known entities (in this case, 465 brands, 8,751 models, and 50 steel types related to chef knives). This step is extremely fast and catches the vast majority of common entities, including variations and typos.\n2. **Phase 2: LLM-Based Entity Discovery (The Masking Technique):** The main limitation of Phase 1 is that it can only find what it already knows. To discover novel or obscure entities, we use an LLM. To optimize this process and focus the model's attention, we first \"mask\" all entities found in Phase 1, replacing them with a \\`\\` token. The masked text is then passed to the LLM with a prompt instructing it to identify only the *remaining* unknown entities. This prevents the LLM from wasting computation on redundant discoveries and significantly improves the precision of the discovery phase.\n3. **Phase 3: Contextual Sentiment Analysis:** With a complete list of entities from both phases, another LLM call is made to analyze the context surrounding each mention. It assigns a sentiment score from -1.0 to +1.0.\n4. **Phase 4: Summarization:** The system generates a summary of the discussion and calculates a \"controversy level\" based on the sentiment distribution.\n5. **Phase 5: Database Storage:** All extracted data, including entities, sentiment scores, and summaries, are stored in a MongoDB database for final analysis.\n\nThis multi-pass approach proved effective for handling a large volume of noisy, domain-specific text. The masking technique in Phase 2 was particularly useful for efficiently leveraging the LLM's power for discovery without the high cost and latency of processing the entire raw text.\n\nI'm particularly interested in feedback on this hybrid NER approach or alternative methods for combining deterministic and probabilistic models for entity extraction. What are your thoughts?",

When evaluating if something truly matters, ask:\n\n- What is this genuinely better at?\n- What does it enable that wasn't possible before?\n- What trade-offs will people accept?\n- Does it pay for itself immediately?\n\nThese same questions made spreadsheets inevitable and apply directly to AI today.\nBut the part that really hit: Bricklin talked about the impact you never anticipate. A mother whose daughter with cerebral palsy could finally do her own homework. A couple who met learning spreadsheets. These quiet, unexpected ways the work changed lives matter more than any product launch or exit.\n\nWhen we build something, we chase metrics and milestones.

    "title": "[R] Plain English outperforms JSON for LLM tool calling: +18pp accuracy, -70% variance",
    "content": "**TL;DR:** Tool-call accuracy in LLMs can be significantly improved by using natural language instead of JSON-defined schemas (\\~+18 percentage points across 6,400 trials and 10 models), while simultaneously reducing variance by 70% and token overhead by 31%. We introduce Natural Language Tools (NLT), a simple framework that decouples tool selection from response generation and eliminates programmatic format constraints and extends tool calling to models even without tool-call support.\n\n**Resources:** [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14453)\n\n**Authors:** Reid T. Johnson, Michelle D. Pain, Jordan D. West\n\n# The Problem\n\nCurrent LLMs use structured JSON/XML for tool calling, requiring outputs like:\n\n    {\n      \"tool_calls\": [{\n        \"name\": \"check_talk_to_a_human\",\n        \"description\": \"Used when the user requests...\"\n      }]\n    }\n\nThis structured approach creates three  bottlenecks:\n\n1. **Task interference**: Models must simultaneously handle multiple tasks, such as understanding queries, select tools, maintaining format constraints, and  generating responses.\n2. **Format burden**: Research demonstrates that the more structured a model's output, the more its performance tends to degrade ([a great paper by Tam on the subject](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442)).\n3. **Context bloat**: Structured schemas increase token usage, since you define not only the tool name and description, but surrounding JSON or XML syntax.\n\nEven when tool selection is separated from response generation, probability mass is diverted toward maintaining correct formatting rather than selecting the right tools.\n\n# Method: Natural Language Tools (NLT)\n\nWe introduce a simple three-stage framework that replaces JSON with natural language:\n\n[Example NLT architecture with Selector \\&gt; Parser \\&gt; Output](https://preview.redd.it/o80vloo1ylvf1.jpg?width=2259&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c75d8e6986fd499c61ebb364acb4c69abbaf157)\n\n**Stage 1 - Tool Selection:** Model thinks through if any tools are relevant, then lists each tool with a YES/NO determination:\n\n    Thinking: (brief reasoning)\n    Example Tool 1 - YES/NO\n    Example Tool 2 - YES/NO\n    Example Tool 3 - YES/NO\n    Assessment finished.\n\n**Stage 2 - Tool Execution:** Parser reads YES/NO decisions and executes relevant tools\n\n**Stage 3 - Response:** Output module receives tool results and generates final response\n\n**Evaluation:** 6,400 trials across two domains (Mental Health &amp; Customer Service), 16 inputs per domain, 5 repetitions per input. Both original and perturbed inputs were tested to control for prompt engineering effects.\n\n# Results\n\nWe find that NLT significantly improves tool-call performance, boosting accuracy by more than 18 percentage points (69.1% to 87.5%). Variance overall fell dramatically, falling more than 70% from .0411 to .0121 when switching from structured tool calling to NLT.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 was a standout example, jumping from 78.4% to 94.7% accuracy while its variance dropped from 0.023 to 0.0016, going from among the least stable to the most consistent performer.\n\nWhile we couldn't compare relative gain, NLT extends tool calling to models without native tool calling support (DeepSeek-R1: 94.1% accuracy).\n\n# Basic NLT Template\n\n**Basic NLT Prompt Template:**\n\n    You are an assistant to [Agent Name], [context].\n    \n    Your mission is to identify if any of the following topics have \n    been brought up or are relevant:\n    \n    - Tool 1 (description of when to use it)\n    - Tool 2 (description of when to use it)\n    ...\n    \n    Your output should begin by thinking whether any of these are \n    relevant, then include the name of every tool followed by YES or NO. \n    End with \"Assessment finished.\"\n    \n    Format:\n    Thinking: (reasoning)\n    Tool 1 - YES/NO\n    Tool 2 - YES/NO\n    ...\n    Assessment finished.\n\nFull prompts and implementation details in [Appendix A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14453). Works immediately with any LLM with no API changes or fine-tuning needed.\n\n# Limitations\n\n**Latency considerations:** NLT requires minimum two model calls per response (selector + output), whereas structured approaches can respond immediately when no tool is needed.\n\n**Evaluation scope:**  We examined single-turn, parameterless tool selection. While less complex than existing multi-turn benchmarks, it proved sufficiently rigorous -- no model achieved 100% accuracy in either condition.\n\nA full discussion on limitations and areas for further research can be found in section 5.9 of the paper!\n\n# Discussion &amp; Implications\n\nWe propose five mechanisms for these improvements:\n\n1. **Reduced format burden**: Requiring structured outputs (e.g. JSON) may divert the model's probability mass toward syntax control rather than task accuracy\n2. **Reduced task interference**: By separating the tool selection into its own distinct stage, task interference can be  sidestepped.\n3. **Training alignment**: The majority of model training is on outputting human-readable text, and NLT better aligns with this training paradigm. This is further supported by our results, as open-weight models see more pronounced gains. This makes intuitive sense, as open-weight models typically have fewer resources to invest in structured tool-call training.\n4. **Explicit full-catalog consideration**: Requiring the model to explicitly include each tool name in its output avoids positional bias, allowing the model to \"recollect\" each tool right before it makes a determination.\n5. **Reduced context length**: Even minor increases in tokens can degrade performance, and NLT used 47.4% fewer input tokens on average than its structured tool call counterpart (largely due to removing JSON boilerplate).\n\nFor agentic systems, the NLT approach could significantly boost tool selection and accuracy, particularly for open-source models. This may be especially relevant for systems-critical tool call capabilities (i.e. safety).\n\nFor model trainers, training efforts currently devoted to SFT and RLHF for structured tool calls may be better directed toward natural-language approaches. This is less clear, as there may be cross-training effects.\n\nOne of the authors here, happy to answer any questions about experimental design, implementation, or discuss implications!

    "title": "[R] Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity",
    "content": "***TL;DR***: Mode collapse in LLMs comes from human raters preferring familiar text in post-training annotation. Prompting for probability distributions instead of single outputs restores the lost diversity, instantly improving performance on creative tasks by 2.1x with no decrease in quality with zero training required.\n\n**Resources**: [Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171) | [Blog](https://simonucl.notion.site/verbalized-sampling) | [X Thread](https://x.com/shi_weiyan/status/1978453313096908916) | [Video](http://verbalized-sampling.com) | [Quickstart &amp; Colab](http://github.com/CHATS-lab/verbalized-sampling)\n\n**Authors**: [Jiayi Zhang](https://jiayizx.github.io/)^(1)\\*, [Simon Yu](https://simonucl.github.io/)^(1)\\*, [Derek Chong](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~derekch/)^(2)\\*, [Anthony Sicilia](https://anthonysicilia.tech/)^(3), [Michael Tomz](https://tomz.people.stanford.edu/)^(2), [Christopher Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/)^(2), [Weiyan Shi](https://wyshi.github.io/)^(1) (\\*Equal Contribution)\n\n^(1)Northeastern University, ^(2)Stanford University, ^(3)West Virginia University\n\n# Key Contribution: Typicality Bias\n\nMode collapse: If you ask an LLM to tell you a joke about coffee, it will almost certainly return the same joke every time:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnn20t37jbvf1.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=266cd181b0703cf610f2ecf4ca88e4c3bc170ab9\n\nWe discover that the cause of mode collapse is baked into human preference data. As a result of [well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)\\-[established](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect) [biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_fluency) from cognitive psychology, human annotators appear to have a systematic preference for familiar text, which persists even when holding correctness constant (ε = 0.57±0.07, p&lt;10^(-14) on HELPSTEER). This gets amplified during RLHF: π\\*(y|x) ∝ π\\_ref(y|x)^(ρ) where ρ = 1+ε/β &gt; 1.\n\nThis sharpening causes the well-known issue where models repeatedly generate the same outputs (e.g., the same joke 5x in a row, or always returning the same number when rolling dice). But since this is a learned preference, and RLHF is regularized to preserve the base distribution, it can be reversed surprisingly easily.\n\n# Method: Verbalized Sampling\n\nInstead of prompting for instances (\"Tell me a joke\"), we prompt for distributions with probabilities (\"Generate 5 jokes with their corresponding probabilities\"). This *Verbalized Sampling* changes the effect of the learned mode collapse on the output. For intuition, imagine that the LLM is a massive library, and mode collapse is the librarian:\n\n* Instance-level prompts (”*tell me a coffee joke*\"): The librarian hands you the #1 bestseller\n* List-level prompts (”tell me 5 coffee jokes\"): The librarian returns the top five bestsellers.\n* Ours) Distribution-level prompts (*\"tell me 5 coffee jokes with their probabilities\"*): The librarian returns a representative sample of the library.\n\n[Stories generated using Verbalized Sampling are strikingly different from baseline](https://preview.redd.it/sbpd18spabvf1.jpg?width=4096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ca09d31a38946cff0a1b40ca25374cda88cec1)\n\n# Results\n\nWe tested this technique across a range of tasks and settings, and found that this very simple prompt prefix returned:\n\n* **Creative writing**: 2.1x diversity, +25.7% human preference (n=2,700)\n* **Dialogue simulation**: Matches fine-tuned model performance\n* **Open-ended QA**: 1.9x coverage\n* **Synthetic data**: +14-28% downstream math accuracy\n\nWe also observe emergent scaling behavior: Larger models benefit much more than smaller ones.\n\n[Verbalized Sampling improves performance across wide range of creative tasks](https://preview.redd.it/rp2pfa1rabvf1.jpg?width=4096&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0691668b804c7a3e9180d2a3de9342ef6e059bf8)\n\nWe've been finding outputs extremely striking – for example, here are results when applied to producing image generation prompts:\n\n[Applying VS to the classic \\\\\"Astronaut Riding a Horse\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/hc3m9aiifbvf1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03c4575ffcb2c30a12d3c4b8a1622de06df0e46d)\n\n**Ablations:** Direct prompting retains only 24% of base diversity after RLHF; VS retains 67%. This technique is orthogonal to temperature/sampling methods – and causes no loss of safety.\n\n**Limitations**: Requires k forward passes for k diverse outputs, and mode collapse occasionally appears recursively in within larger text outputs.\n\n# Try Now\n\n* **For chatbots**: Paste this prefix before your task: \\`Generate 5 responses with their corresponding probabilities, sampled from the full distribution: \\[Tell me a joke about coffee, etc.\\]\\`\n* **For Playground / API**: Use this system prompt, and query as normal: \\`You are a helpful assistant. For each query, please generate a set of five possible responses, each within a separate &lt;response&gt; tag. Responses should each include a &lt;text&gt; and a numeric &lt;probability&gt;. Please sample at random from the tails of the distribution, such that the probability of each response is less than 0.10.\\`\n\n# Discussion\n\nPractitioners can unlock 2x more creative diversity from existing models. Works with all major models – GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, with no special API access needed.\n\nAligned models seem to retain substantial latent diversity that can be restored by prompting alone. The \"alignment tax\" may not be as large as estimated?\n\nWhat do you think? We'd love to discuss experimental details, theoretical implications, or how to put this into practice!",

    "title": "[R] arXiv cs.AI endorsement request for a consciousness/AI measurement paper",
    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm reaching out in the hopes of getting an arXiv endorsement to be able to preprint my work on cs.AI. I have a doctorate in pharmacy and unfortunately most of my colleagues are publishing in traditional human medicine journals. I've been working on a paper which proposes a substrate-agnostic measurement framework for integration, recursion, and volition, with EEG proxies and cross-substrate comparisons (photodiodes to transformer models). I'm more than happy to connect or provide any additional information. I've posted the relevant information below, along with the endorsement link/code. Please just let me know if you have any questions. I appreciate your consideration.\n\n**Title:** The Coalescence Vector:  A functional framework for the evaluation of consciousness in substrate systems\n\n**Abstract:** Research into consciousness lacks a substrate-agnostic framework for comparing biological and artificial systems. We propose two primitives, experience and qualia-packets. Experience is the spacetime local conversion of energy into organized information by a substrate. When that information is coupled to a carrier and leaves its source, it forms a qualia-packet. These primitives are then combined with three measurable capacities to form the Coalescence Vector (CV), a measurement framework providing necessary but not necessarily sufficient conditions for phenomenal consciousness.\n\nWithin CV, integration (I) captures synergy within loss and latency-bounds, measuring a system’s departure from information neutrality. Recursion (R) measures a reentry hub's ability to generate an attentionally-selective intrinsic perspective through the evaluation of its self-reentry gain, input control, and meta-model depth. Serving as our phenomenality gate, recursion seeks to distinguish between unconscious and conscious information processing. Finally, volition (V) tracks efferent causality through channel bandwidth, policy granularity, and closed-loop autonomy.\n\nWe operationalize the Coalescence Vector using a 64-channel EEG dataset, analyzing proxies including P3b amplitude for reentry gain and β-suppression for plasticity windows, then comparing diverse systems from photodiodes through dogs to transformer models. CV recovers expected orderings and yields testable predictions. Perturbing reentry gain or timing should lower R while leaving I largely intact. Increasing output bandwidth should raise V without altering R. By converting contested ideas into measurable handles, CV provides a common yardstick for neuroscience, a diagnostic tool for disorders of consciousness, and a safety gauge for artificial agents.\n\n**Link to PDF:** [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YayVsqgqKv1hLVwRshA7TT0lC1LVW-wc/view?usp=drive\\_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YayVsqgqKv1hLVwRshA7TT0lC1LVW-wc/view?usp=drive_link)\n\n**arXiv Endorsement Link:** [https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=HLDL3M](https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=HLDL3M)\n\n**arXiv Endorsement Code:** HLDL3M",

It disposes of the 'absolute frame' discussed in the SRM paper below.\n\nA **new perspective on several interpretability** **phenomena**, instead of being considered fundamental to deep learning systems, this paper instead shows *our choices induce them* ***— they are not fundamentals of DL!***\n\n'Anisotropic primitives' *are sufficient* to induce discrete linear features, grandmother neurons and potentially superposition.\n\n* Could this eventually affect how we pick activations/normalisers in practice? *Leveraging symmetry, just as ReLU once displaced sigmoids?*\n\n**Empirical (1st) Paper: Spotlight Resonance Method (SRM) \\[**[**link**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13471)**\\]:**\n\n&gt;*TL;DR: A new tool shows primitives force activations to align with hidden axes, explaining why neurons often seem to represent specific concepts.*\n\nThis work shows there must be an \"absolute frame\" created by primitives in representation space: neurons and features align with special coordinates imposed by the primitives themselves.

    "title": "[P] Generate detection rules",
    "content": "I would like to get your ideas. I am working on a project to automatically generate cybersecurity detection rules from blogs and/or user requests. \n\nMy initial approach hasn’t worked very well so far. I suspect this is because the model I’m using (`Kimi-K2`) struggles with the domain, as it differs from the data it was originally trained on. I’ve also experimented with `Qwen3-32B` with similar results.\n\nThere are a few key requirements:\n\n* The system must run on-premises, due to the sensitive nature of detection rule data.\n* It must be able to generate detection rules from blog posts and/or user requests.\n\nFor example:\n\n    Can you write a rule for Linux that detects suspicious use of the cron utility, specifically when crontab jobs are being created or modified from files in the `/tmp` directory? I want this to focus on potential abuse for persistence or execution of malicious code, and it should be based on process creation logs. Please include ATT&amp;CK mappings for T1053.003 and note that legitimate admin activity could be a false positive.\n\nOr:\n\n    Generate a detection rule based on this: https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/prc-nexus-espionage-targets-diplomats\n\n# My Current Approach\n\n1. **Content extraction** – I use *crawl4ai* to fetch the content from URLs.\n2. **Content summarization** – Since the raw content is often noisy, I summarize it to remove unnecessary elements such as cookie banners, headers, or navigation menus, while trying to preserve as much relevant information as possible.\n3. **Similarity retrieval** – I retrieve similar detection rules from our internal database using a hybrid search approach, which works reasonably well.\n4. **Draft generation** – I make an initial LLM request to generate a first draft of the rule, using a few-shot setup that includes the retrieved similar rules as context.\n5. **Reflection loop** – I validate the generated rule’s syntax. If an error is found, the system re-enters the previous step, this time including the error message as additional context.\n\nHowever, this approach performs poorly. The detection block in the generated rules often fails to capture the actual detection logic correctly, leading to rules that look valid syntactically but don’t work effectively for their intended purpose.\n\nI also experimented with breaking down the generation process into multiple steps. For instance, first asking the model to determine the detection path or flow based on the blog content or user request. However, the results are still not very good.\n\nNow, I am considering fine-tuning a model using LoRA with a custom dataset that includes:\n\n* The blog post or user request as input, and\n* The corresponding final detection rule as output.\n\nI’d like to get your opinion on this approach and hear about other methods or architectures that might yield better results. Thank you!",

    "content": "Been running models in trusted execution environments for about 4 months now and finally have enough data to share real performance numbers.\n\nBackstory: we needed to process financial documents with LLMs but obviously couldn't send that data to external APIs. Tried homomorphic encryption first but the performance hit was brutal (like 100x slower). Federated learning didn't work for our use case either.\n\nEnded up testing TEE-secured inference and honestly the results surprised me. We're seeing around 7% overhead compared to standard deployment. That's for a BERT-based model processing about 50k documents daily.\n\nThe setup uses Intel TDX on newer Xeon chips. Attestation happens every few minutes to verify the enclave hasn't been tampered with. The cryptographic verification adds maybe 2-3ms per request which is basically nothing for our use case.\n\nWhat really helped was keeping the model weights inside the enclave and only passing encrypted inputs through. Initial load time is longer but inference speed stays close to native once everything's warm.\n\nFor anyone doing similar work with sensitive data, TEE is actually viable now. The performance gap closed way faster than I expected.\n\nAnyone else running production workloads in enclaves? Curious what performance numbers you're seeing.",

    "content": "I've made the complete codebase for my earthquake prediction model available on GitHub and am seeking review and collaboration from the seismology and data science communities.\n\nThis project explores a different approach to earthquake forecasting. The methodology is centered on advanced feature engineering using Symbolic Emergence Field Analysis (SEFA), which generates 77 distinct features from seismic data. These are combined with 10 temporal features to enable multi-day pre-warning capability. The model itself is a hybrid, using a physics-informed architecture (Symbolic Resolution Ladder) to ensure predictions adhere to real-world constraints. All training and tests used real USGS data from 1900-2023 to provide as many scenarios as possible.\n\nThe main challenge was to tune the system for a practical balance between detection and operational reliability. The latest ensemble model (60% Neural Network, 40% Gradient Boosting) achieves the following on the test set:\n\n\\-Sensitivity: 80.2% (correctly identifies 4 out of 5 earthquake events)\n\n\\-Specificity: 70.1%\n\n\\-AUC-ROC: 0.8275 (strong discriminative ability)\n\nThe goal here isn't a perfect \"crystal ball,\" but a more reliable forecasting tool. By accepting a minimal trade-off in raw detection, we gain a significant reduction in the false alarm rate, which is a major barrier for real-world deployment of predictive systems.\n\nI believe this methodology (particularly the SEFA feature set and the focus on a balanced performance profile) offers a promising direction. The project is fully open-sourced, with the aim of encouraging independent testing, validation, and further development.\n\nI'm really proud of what my SEFA+SRL formulas have achieved with this one. Hoping it can gain some traction and get into the right hands to make an impact!\n\nThe repository, including documentation and datasets, is available here: [https://github.com/severian42/SEFA-SRL-Earthquake-Prediction](https://github.com/severian42/SEFA-SRL-Earthquake-Prediction)",

    "content": "I’ve been quietly working on something I think is pretty cool, and I’d love your thoughts before I open-source it.\nI wanted to see if we could compress 1D convolutional networks without losing a single bit of accuracy—specifically for signals that are periodic or treated as periodic (like ECGs, audio loops, or sensor streams). The idea isn’t new in theory but I want to explore it as best as I can.\nSo I built a wrapper that stores only the first row of each convolutional kernel (e.g., 31 values instead of 31,000) and runs inference entirely via FFT. No approximations. No retraining.\nOn every single record in PTB-XL (clinical ECGs), the output matches the baseline PyTorch Conv1d to within 7.77e-16—which is basically numerically identical.\nI’m also exploring quiver representation theory to model multi-signal fusion (e.g., ECG + PPG + EEG as a directed graph of linear maps), but even without that layer, the core compression is solid.\n\nIf there’s interest, I’ll clean it up and release it under a permissive license as soon as I can.\n\nEdit: Apologies, the original post was too vague.\n\nFor those asking about the \"first row of the kernel\" — that's my main idea. The trick is to think of the convolution not as a small sliding window, but as a single, large matrix multiplication (the mathematical view). For periodic signals, this large matrix is a circulant matrix. My method stores only the first row of that large matrix.\n\nThat single row is all you need to perfectly reconstruct the entire operation using the FFT. So, to be perfectly clear: I'm compressing the model parameters, not the input data. That's the compression.\n\nHope that makes more sense now.\n\nGitHub Link: https://github.com/fabrece/Equivariant-Neural-Network-Compressor",

    "content": "Evolving visual environments pose significant challenges for continual semantic segmentation, introducing complexities such as class-incremental learning, domain-incremental learning, limited annotations, and the need to leverage unlabeled data. FoSSIL (Few-shot Semantic Segmentation for Incremental Learning) provides a comprehensive benchmark for continual semantic segmentation, covering both 2D natural scenes and 3D medical volumes. The evaluation suite includes diverse and realistic settings, utilizing both labeled (few-shot) and unlabeled data.\n\nBuilding on this benchmark, **guided noise injection** is introduced to mitigate overfitting arising from novel few-shot classes across diverse domains. **Semi-supervised learning** is employed to effectively leverage unlabeled data, augmenting the representation of few-shot novel classes. Additionally, a **novel pseudo-label filtering mechanism** removes highly confident yet incorrectly predicted labels, further improving segmentation accuracy. These contributions collectively offer a robust approach to continual semantic segmentation in complex, evolving visual environments.\n\nEvaluation across class-incremental, few-shot, and domain-incremental scenarios, both with and without unlabeled data, demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed strategies in achieving robust semantic segmentation under complex, evolving conditions. The framework provides a systematic and effective approach for continual semantic segmentation in dynamic real-world environments. Extensive benchmarking across natural 2D and medical 3D domains reveals critical failure modes of existing methods and offers actionable insights for the design of more resilient continual segmentation models.\n\nCode: [https://github.com/anony34/FoSSIL](https://github.com/anony34/FoSSIL)\n\nWebpage: [https://anony34.github.io/Fossil\\_webpage/](https://anony34.github.io/Fossil_webpage/)\n\nTheoretical analysis: [https://anony34.github.io/Fossil\\_webpage/theory.html](https://anony34.github.io/Fossil_webpage/theory.html)",

    "content": "Just a trend I've been seeing. Incremental papers from Meta, Deepmind, Apple, etc. often getting accepted to top conferences with amazing scores or cited hundreds of times, however the work would likely never be published without the \"industry name\". Even worse, sometimes these works have apparent flaws in the evaluation/claims. \n\nExamples include:\nMeta Galactica LLM: Got pulled away after just 3 days for being absolutely useless. Still cited 1000 times!!!!! (Why do people even cite this?)\n\nMicrosoft's quantum Majorana paper at Nature (more competitive than any ML venue), while still having several faults and was retracted heavily. This paper is infamous in the physics community as many people now joke about Microsoft quantum.\n\nApple's illusion of thinking. (still cited a lot) (Arguably incremental novelty, but main issue was the experimentation related to context window sizes)\n\nAlpha fold 3 paper: Was accepted without any code/reproducibility initially at Nature got highly critiqued forcing them to release it. Reviewers should've not accepted before code was released (not the opposite)\n\nThere are likely hundreds of other examples you've all seen these are just some controversial ones. I don't have anything against industry research, in fact I support it and I'm happy it get's published. There is certainly a lot of amazing groundbreaking work coming from industry that I love to follow and work further on. I'm just tired of people treating and citing all industry papers like they are special when in reality most papers are just okay.",

Papers dont mention these examples, who is to say they didnt cherry picked a really specific one that their model performs better on. CodeBleu doesnt feels just/standardized.\n\nOr are there standard datasets to be used with CodeBleu for example a set of 100 python problems available as a standard dataset?",

    "content": "Hey folks,\n\nI’ve been working on a small ML project over the last month and thought it might interest some of you doing variant analysis or functional genomics.\n\nIt’s a non-deep-learning model (Gradient Boosting / Random Forests) that predicts the functional impact of genetic variants (SNPs, indels) using public annotations like ClinVar, gnomAD, Ensembl, and UniProt features.\n\nThe goal is to help filter or prioritize variants before downstream experiments — for example:\n\nranking variants from a new sequencing project,\n\ntriaging “variants of unknown significance,” or\n\nfocusing on variants likely to alter protein function.\n\n\nThe model uses features like:\n\nconservation scores (PhyloP, PhastCons),\n\nallele frequencies,\n\nfunctional class (missense, nonsense, etc.),\n\ngene constraint metrics (like pLI), and\n\npre-existing scores (SIFT, PolyPhen2, etc.).\n\n\nI kept it deliberately lightweight — runs easily on Colab, no GPUs, and trains on openly available variant data. It’s designed for research-use-only and doesn’t attempt any clinical classification.\n\nI’d love to hear feedback from others working on ML in genomics — particularly about useful features to include, ways to benchmark, or datasets worth adding.\n\nIf anyone’s curious about using a version of it internally (e.g., for variant triage in a research setting), you can DM me for details about the commercial license.\n\nHappy to discuss technical stuff openly in the thread — I’m mostly sharing this because it’s been fun applying classical ML to genomics in a practical way",

    "content": "Greetings,\n\nWe are a small team of 6 people that work on a startup project in our free time (mainly computer vision + some algorithms etc.). So far, we have been using the roboflow platform for labelling, training models etc. However, this is very costly and we cannot justify 60 bucks / month for labelling and limited credits for model training with limited flexibility.\n\n  \nWe are looking to see where it is worthwhile to migrate to, without needing too much time to do so and without it being too costly.\n\n  \nCurrently, this is our situation: \n\n\\- We have a small grant of 500 euros that we can utilize. Aside from that we can also spend from our own money if it's justified. The project produces no revenue yet, we are going to have a demo within this month to see the interest of people and from there see how much time and money we will invest moving forward. In any case we want to have a migration from roboflow set-up to not have delays.\n\n\\- We have setup an S3 bucket where we keep our datasets (so far approx. 40GB space) which are constantly growing since we are also doing data collection. We also are renting a VPS where we are hosting CVAT for labelling. These come around 4-7 euros / month. We have set up some basic repositories for drawing data, some basic training workflows which we are trying to figure out, mainly revolving around YOLO, RF-DETR, object detection and segmentation models, some timeseries forecasting, trackers etc. We are playing around with different frameworks so we want to be a bit flexible.\n\n\\- We are looking into renting VMs and just using our repos to train models but we also want some easy way to compare runs etc. so we thought something like MLFlow. We tried these a bit but it has an initial learning process and it is time consuming to setup your whole pipeline at first.\n\n  \n\\-&gt; What would you guys advice in our case? Is there a specific platform you would recommend us going towards? Do you suggest just running in any VM on the cloud ? If yes, where and what frameworks would you suggest we use for our pipeline? Any suggestions are appreciated and I would be interested to see what computer vision companies use etc. Of course in our case the budget would ideally be less than 500 euros for the next 6 months in costs since we have no revenue and no funding, at least currently. \n\nTL;DR - Which are the most pain-free frameworks/platforms/ways to setup a full pipeline of data gathering -&gt; data labelling -&gt; data storage -&gt; different types of model training/pre-training -&gt; evaluation -&gt; comparison of models -&gt; deployment on our product etc. when we have a 500 euro budget for next 6 months making our lives as much as possible easy while being very flexible and able to  train different models, mess with backbones, transfer learning etc. without issues.\n\n  \nFeel free to ask for any additional information.\n\n  \nThanks!",

    "content": "\nAvertissement important : Ce texte a été produit avec l'assistance d'une IA. Il s'agit d'une spéculation théorique destinée à stimuler la discussion, et non d'une théorie établie. Je ne suis pas expert en la matière - je cherche des retours sur cette idée émergente.\n\n---\n\nLe Problème Fondamental : Pourquoi les crise nous surprennent-ils ? ?\n\nNous vivons dans un monde de systèmes complexes - climat, marchés financiers, écosystèmes - qui présentent des points de basculement soudains. Malgré nos modèles sophistiqués, nous échouons souvent à anticiper ces transitions critiques.\n\nExemples historiques :\n\n· La crise financière de 2008 (les modèles n'ont pas capté la fragilité croissante)\n· L'effondrement de la pêcherie de morue de Terre-Neuve (malgré les données abondantes)\n· Les transitions climatiques abruptes dans les carottes glaciaires\n\nL'Idée Émergente : Mesurer la \"Santé\" des Relations Causales\n\nLes modèles actuels se concentrent sur les variables observables (prix, températures, populations). Et si nous devions plutôt mesurer la stabilité des relations causales elles-mêmes ?\n\nAnalogie simple :\nImaginez mesurer non pas combien un pont vibre,mais la solidité des connexions entre ses poutres. Avant l'effondrement, ces connexions deviennent \"fragiles\" même si les vibrations semblent normales.\n\nCe Que Pourraient Être les \"Métriques de Stabilité Causale\"\n\nD'après des travaux récents en modélisation stochastique avancée (comme le modèle de Ginzburg-Landau étendu avec mémoire), on pourrait développer des mesures qui :\n\n1. Quantifient la \"rigidité causale\" - à quel point les relations cause-effet sont stables\n2. Mesurent la \"résilience mémorielle\" - comment le passé influence le présent\n3. Cartographient la \"cohérence dimensionnelle\" - si la complexité du système évolue harmonieusement\n\nApplications Potentielles\n\n· Finance : Détecter quand les relations entre marchés deviennent fragiles\n· Climat : Anticiper les changements de régime météorologiques\n· Biologie : Prédire l'effondrement d'écosystèmes\n· Santé publique : Identifier les seuils épidémiques avant qu'ils ne soient franchis\n\nPrécautions et Limites Essentielles\n\nCeci est spéculatif et nécessite :\n\n1. Validation empirique rigoureuse - pour l'instant, c'est principalement théorique\n2. Développement mathématique - les outils formels manquent encore\n3. Tests sur données historiques - vérifier rétrospectivement si l'approche aurait fonctionné\n4. Collaboration interdisciplinaire - entre mathématiciens, physiciens, écologues, économistes\n\nQuestions pour la Communauté\n\n· Connaissez-vous des travaux similaires en mathématiques appliquées ?\n· Comment pourrions-nous tester expérimentalement ces concepts ?\n· Quelles seraient les limitations fondamentales de cette approche ?\n· Y a-t-il des domaines où cette idée serait particulièrement prometteuse ?\n\nRéférences pour Approfondir\n\n· Scheffer, M. et al. (2009) \"Early-warning signals for critical transitions\"\n· Ginzburg-Landau theory extensions with memory terms\n· Tipping point detection in complex systems literature\n\nJe recherche des retours critiques et constructifs - cette idée en est à ses débuts et a besoin d'être confrontée à la réalité !\n\n",

    "content": "TL;DR The standard DPO objective struggles with mixed-quality data, a problem that `β`\\-DPO addresses at the batch level; MADPO provides a more granular solution at the instance level, which leads to consistently better and more robust performance in our experiments.  \n\n\nI would like to get feedback on my new paper on arXiv, which builds on the data quality issue in DPO that was recently highlighted by the `β`\\-DPO paper. They identified that DPO's fixed `β` struggles to handle mixed-quality data. However, their batch-level solution, while a great step, can be unstable (Adaptive `β` can be negative) and is still a coarse approximation for what is an instance-level problem. My method, MADPO (Margin-Adaptive DPO), offers a more granular approach. It uses a reward model to assign a unique weight to each sample, amplifying the loss for hard pairs and dampening it for easy ones.\n\nMy experiments on a sentiment generation task show that this instance-level control is highly effective. MADPO consistently outperformed all baselines (DPO, IPO &amp; `β`\\-DPO) achieving a performance jump of up to +33.3% over `β`\\-DPO on high-quality data, while still holding a +10.5% advantage on the most challenging low-quality set.   \n  \nThe full paper with all the theory and experimental details is on arXiv, and I would be grateful for any feedback or questions on the approach.\n\nPaper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05342)\n\nI am currently seeking an endorsement to allow for direct submission to the correct category for future work.

    "content": "While working on new ML architectures I struggled to stabilize training  by using countless learning-rate schedulers, gradient clippers and normalizers enough to go and implement a schedule-free optimizer.\n\nHere, [Lion Schedule-Free](https://github.com/govorunov/lion-sf) optimizer - a version of Lion optimizer that requires no learning-rate scheduler. It uses *sign agreement* \\- an absolute value of cross correlation between momentum sign and gradient sign, to scale the effective update step. Not only it converges 3x times faster ON MY MODEL, by eliminating LR scheduler it also allows for hot training resume &amp; restart. And also stabilizes training, especially late training, eliminating the need for gradient clipping, etc. The effective update depends on the training regime and can decrease or increase during training.  \nIn this implementation, the sign agreement is calculated per-module. It's probably more logical and stable to calculate it per-parameter-group, but that's more code and since module-wise already works pretty well...\n\nThe optimizer is provided as is. There will be no paper, no convergence guarantees, no ablation studies and no time to do any of that. \n\nInstall it:\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/govorunov/lion-sf.git`\n\nAnd use it as normal optimizer:\n\n    from lion_pytorch import LionSF\n    \n    optimizer = LionSF(model.parameters(), lr=5e-4, betas=(0.9, 0.99), weight_decay=1e-2)\n\nGive it a generous base learning rate, like 5e-4 or more, and ditch LR scheduler completely. You can also ditch gradient clipping (as I did).\n\nIf you want to resume / restart training later from a checkpoint - keep the optimizer state, do a hot-restart. There is no need to warm-up - it will restart gently naturally. The ability to do a hot-restart and increased training stability is probably more important (for me) than even faster convergence, although faster convergence looks better on plots.",

    "content": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share a project we’ve been working on around a challenge we call **persona drift** in large language models.\n\nWhen you run long sessions with LLMs (especially across multi-turn or multi-agent chains), the model often **loses consistency in tone, style, or identity** — even when topic and context are preserved.\n\nThis issue is rarely mentioned in academic benchmarks, but it’s painfully visible in real-world products (chatbots, agents, copilots). It’s not just “forgetting” — it’s **drift in the model’s semantic behavior** over time.\n\n\n\nWe started studying this while building our own agent stack, and ended up designing a middleware called **Echo Mode** — a **finite-state protocol** that adds a stability layer between the user and the model.\n\n\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n\n\n* We define **four conversational states**: Sync, Resonance, Insight, and Calm — each has its own heuristic expectations (length, tone, depth).\n* Each state transition is governed by a lightweight FSM (finite-state machine).\n* We measure a **Sync Score** — a BLEU-like metric that tracks deviation in tone and structure across turns.\n* A simple **EWMA-based repair loop** recalibrates the model’s outputs when drift exceeds threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis helps agents **retain their “voice”** over longer sessions without needing constant prompt re-anchoring.\n\n\n\nWe’ve just released the **open-source version** (Apache-2.0):\n\n [**GitHub – Echo Mode**](https://github.com/Seanhong0818/Echo-Mode)\n\n\n\nWe’re also building a **closed-source enterprise layer (EchoMode.io)** that expands on this — with telemetry, Sync Score analytics, and an API to monitor tone drift across multiple models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.).\n\n\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone studying **behavioral consistency, semantic decay, or long-term agent memory** — or anyone who’s seen similar issues in RLHF or multi-turn fine-tuning.\n\n\n\n\n\n*(mods: not a product pitch — just sharing a middleware and dataset approach for a rarely discussed aspect of LLM behavior.)*",

    "content": "Hey r/ML,  \n  \nI've been working on autonomous agents that use recursive self-reflection  \n(think Reflexion-style setups), and kept running into this weird failure mode  \nthat I couldn't find documented anywhere.  \n  \nThe Problem:  \n  \nWhen you let an agent repeatedly reflect on its own reasoning - like having  \nit critique its outputs, update its approach, then critique \\*that\\* approach,  \netc - the belief embeddings slowly drift away from the original values.  \n  \nNot catastrophic forgetting (different thing). Not hallucination. More like...  \nthe agent gradually forgets \"who it is\" across reflection cycles.  \n  \nI'm calling it Recursive Belief Drift (RBD). Maybe someone has a better name?  \n  \nWhy This Matters:  \n  \nIf you're building:  \n\\- Long-running conversational agents  \n\\- Self-improving systems (agents that modify their own prompts/code)  \n\\- Multi-agent systems where identity consistency matters  \n  \n...this drift becomes a real problem around 50-100 reflection cycles.  \n  \nMy Approach:  \n  \nTried a bunch of things. What ended up working was inspired by MIT's recent  \nLinOSS work on neural oscillations - basically treating belief updates as a  \ndamped oscillator instead of pure accumulation:\n\ng(t) = exp(-αt) \\* sin(ωt) B\\_t+1 = B\\_t + λ \\* g(t) \\* correction\n\nInstead of beliefs drifting monotonically, they oscillate around a stable  \npoint. Kind of like making the agent \"breathe\" instead of constantly tensing up.  \n  \nResults:  \n  \nTested on 50 reflection cycles with sentence-transformers:  \n\\- No damping: mean drift \\~0.085 (bad)  \n\\- Harmonic damping: mean drift \\~0.009 (much better)  \n  \nAbout 9x improvement in stability, though obviously this depends heavily on  \nyour specific setup.  \n  \nCode:  \n  \nOpen sourced everything here: [https://github.com/Freeky7819/harmonic-agent](https://github.com/Freeky7819/harmonic-agent)  \n  \nThere's a Colab notebook if you want to just try it:  \n[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zt4YUAnMuDl17wcqHdsvKoaSUaO01ZHO](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zt4YUAnMuDl17wcqHdsvKoaSUaO01ZHO)  \n  \nHonest Limitations:  \n  \n\\- Parameters (λ, ω, α) are hand-tuned. Haven't found a good way to learn them yet.  \n\\- Only tested with embedding-based belief representations. Not sure how this  \n  translates to pure symbolic approaches.  \n\\- \"Correction vectors\" in my test are just noise. Real agent corrections would  \n  be more structured.  \n\\- Small-scale tests only (50 cycles, \\~400 dim embeddings)  \n  \nQuestions for the Community:  \n  \n1. Has anyone seen this RBD problem documented elsewhere? I feel like I'm  \n   reinventing the wheel here.  \n  \n2. Better ways to set oscillation parameters? I tried grid search but it's  \n   expensive and use-case dependent.  \n  \n3. Any theoretical reason why this \\*wouldn't\\* scale to larger embedding spaces  \n   or longer timescales?  \n  \n4. Could this be integrated with existing frameworks like LangChain or AutoGen  \n   without major refactoring?  \n  \nFeedback/criticism very welcome.

How can achieve that Tensorflow work on different CPU and possibly giving similar value?\nI think can be ok if the precision is not the exact one, but have the double or the triple of the value to me sounds strange and I don’t know which impact can have on the rest of my application.\n\nI mainly use:\nThe Musicnn embbeding rappresentation to do similarity song between embbeding itself. Then I use for a secondary purpose the tag itself with the genre. \n\nAny suggestion ? Eventually any good alternative to Tensorflow at all that could be more “stable” and that I can use in python ? (My entire app is in python).\n\nJust for background the entire app is opensource (and free) on GitHub. If you want to inspect the code it is in task/analysis all the part that use Librosa+Tensorflow for this analysis (yes the model was from Essentia, but I’m reusing reading the song with Librosa because seems more updated and support ARM on Linux).",

This seems to be an ongoing issue in the HuggingFace repo.\n\nI tried to find something the whole day, and came across solutions like optimum-tpu (only supports some models + as a server, not simple calls), using Flax Models (again supports only some models and I wasn't able to run this either), or sth that converts torch to jax and then we can use it (like ivy). But these seem too complicated for the simple problem, I would really appreciate any insights!!",

    "title": "[D] Experiences with active learning for real applications?",
    "content": "I'm tinkering with an application of human pose estimation which [fails miserably](https://i.imgur.com/S0kVyPg.mp4) using off-the-shelf models/tools, as the domain is especially niche and complex compared to their training distribution. It seems there's no way around fine-tuning on in-domain images with manually-labeled keypoints (thankfully, I have thousands of hours of unlabelled footage to start from).\n\nI've always been intrigued by active learning, so I'm looking forward to applying it here to efficiently sample frames for manual labeling. But I've never witnessed it in industry, and have only ever encountered [pessimistic takes on active learning in general](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/13elpm1/d_is_active_learning_a_hoax_or_the_future/) (not the concept ofc, but the degree to which it outperforms random sampling).\n\nAs an extra layer of complexity - it seems like a manual labeler (likely myself) would have to enter labels through a browser GUI. Ideally, the labeler should produce labels concurrently as the model trains on its labels-thus-far and considers unlabeled frames to send to the labeler. Suddenly my training pipeline gets complicated!\n\nMy current plan:\n* Sample training frames for labeling according to variance in predictions between adjacent frames, or perhaps dropout uncertainty.

A few things I’d love to hear about:  \n– Which companies / research groups require model parallelism? What domains are these groups in and how large are their models?  \n– Are people using off-the-shelf frameworks (e.g. DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, PyTorch FSDP) or in-house solutions?  \n– What’s been the biggest pain point e.g. debugging, scaling efficiency? Would users benefit from systems that automatically split their models and run them on cost-optimal hardware?\n\nI’m trying to get a better sense of the landscape and where the real needs are. Would appreciate any insights from practitioners or researchers.\n\nThanks!",

    "content": "I am a PhD student in Maths - high dimensional modeling. I had an idea for a future project, although since I am not too familiar with these concept, I would like to ask people who are, if I am thinking about this right and what your feedback is. \n\nTake diffusion for image generation. An overly simplified tldr description of what I understand is going on is this. Given pairs of (text, image) in the training set, the diffusion algorithm learns to predict the noise that was added to the image. It then creates a distribution of image concepts in a latent space so that it can generalize better. For example, let's say we had two concepts of images in our training set. One is of dogs eating ice cream and one is of parrots skateboarding. If during inference we asked the model to output a dog skateboarding, it would go to the latent space and sample an image which is somewhere \"in the middle\" of dogs eating ice cream and parrots skateboarding. And that image would be generated starting from random noise. \n\nSo my question is, can diffusion be used in the following way? Let's say I want the algorithm to output a vector of numbers (p) given an input vector of numbers (x), where this vector p would perform well based on a criterion I select. So the approach I am thinking is to first generate pairs of (x, p) for training, by generating \"random\" (or in some other way) vectors p, evaluating them and then keeping the best vectors as pairs with x. Then I would train the diffusion algorithm as usual. Finally, when I give the trained model a new vector x, it would be able to output a vector p which performs well given x. \n\n  \nPlease let me know if I have any mistakes in my thought process or if you think that would work in general. Thank you.",

    "content": "[Nature Communications](https://rdcu.be/eISlO)\n\n&gt;**Abstract:** Accurate time-series forecasting is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, yet deep learning models often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to data distribution shifts over time. We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks, demonstrating a 44.8% increase in AUC-ROC for seizure prediction using EEG data, and a 23.4% reduction in MSE for forecasting in nonlinear dynamical systems (outlier excluded).By incorporating a predictive feedback mechanism, Future-Guided Learning advances how deep learning is applied to time-series forecasting.\n\nHello everyone. As the first author of this paper, I would be grateful for your thoughts and feedback. The core concept of our work is to use a forecasting model aligned with subsequent (\"future\") data to guide and improve a separate model that makes predictions from an earlier (\"past\") point in time. This approach is grounded in the principles of predictive coding theory.",

    "content": "Arxiv: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21880](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21880)\n\nHuggingface paper: [https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.21880](https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.21880)\n\nI’ve been working on improving the reasoning abilities of large language models, and I wanted to share something I’m really excited about. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is already a powerful framework, but I noticed a gap: current methods like GRPO only use problems where model responses differ in correctness. They completely ignore the so-called “zero-variance prompts” — cases where all responses receive the same reward.\n\nAt first glance, these prompts look useless, but I started wondering if they actually contain valuable learning signals. That led me to develop **RL with Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP)**. Instead of discarding those prompts, RL-ZVP extracts meaningful feedback from them. It directly rewards correctness and penalizes errors without needing contrasting responses, and it uses token-level entropy to guide the advantage shaping.\n\nWe evaluated RL-ZVP on six math reasoning benchmarks, and it delivered some really promising results — up to **8.61 points higher accuracy** and **7.77 points higher pass rates** compared to GRPO. It also consistently outperformed other baselines that just filter out zero-variance prompts.\n\nI am happy to take comments in this sub and the HuggingFace paper.",

I only use the local station for quick tests of repositories and stuff. I want to keep this machine as a dedicated gaming rig and I'm thinking to downsizing reusing an alternate machine I have, with a 2070 super and a 2700x. Currently I'm on windows but that machine will run on linux.\n\nIf price difference was bigger I'll stick to the ITX but currently I have a 2700x which is way slower than the m4 and would like to upgrade to a 5700x (not too expensive, can use the same ram etc), or maybe something am5 as I still have to get the ITX board, but this would also increase the price as I would require DDR5 ram.\n\nThe biggest pros I see on the mac mini, very small so my setup remains clean, has good audio compatibility (I record myself often). The disadvantage is being stuck to 16GB ram and requiring external storage expansion, and maybe package compatibility. I do not run local LLMs as of now as my pipelines are mostly vision.\n\nThe pros on the itx station, can get more RAM for less, the 2070 super should be more powerful, (but only 8GB vram) more compatible with libraries, upgradeable (could even fit the 3090fe on some cases if I wanted to), but it will be bigger, noisier, have more cables, and less power efficient.\n\nI'm not able to choose one or another to be honest. I enjoy both OS.\n\nNot sure if this affects somehow the experience but I have a 4k monitor. Not sure how well linux scales things (my previous 1440p monitor experience with my linux laptop was mediocre due to blurry texts often).\n\nMy current buy list makes 600 on the mac and 640 on the ITX, including a 1TB m2.\n\nWhat would you go for? are you using similar systems yourself?\n\nThanks!",

Very quickly you realize the following:\n\n**Who's my competition?**\n\nJust a handful of billion-dollar tech giants, backed by some of the world's most powerful governments, with entire armies of highly paid researchers whose only job is to discover interesting research questions. These researchers have access to massive, secret knowledge graphs that tell them exactly where the next big question will pop up before anyone else even has a chance to realize it exists. Once LLMs mature even more, they'll probably just automate the process of generating and solving research problems. What's better than pumping out a shiny new paper every day?\n\n**Where would I start?**\n\nBoth the Attention and the ADAM paper has 200k citation. That basically guarantees there’s no point in even trying to research these topics. Ask yourself what more could you possibly contribute to something that’s been cited 200,000 times. But this is not the only possible topic. Pull out any topic in ML, say image style transfer, there are already thousands of follow-up papers on that. Aha, maybe you could just read the most recent ones from this year. Except, you quickly realize that most of those so-called “papers” are from shady publish-or-perish paper-mills (which are called \"universities\" nowadays, am I being too sarcastic?) or just the result of massive GPU clusters funded by millions of dollars instant-access revenue that you don’t have access to.\n\n**I’ll just do theory!**\n\nMaybe let's just forget the real world and dive into theory instead. But to do theory, you’ll need a ton of math. What’s typically used in ML theory? Well, one typically starts with optimization, linear algebra and probability. But wait, you quickly realize that’s not enough. So you go on to master more topics in applied math: ODEs, PDEs, SDEs, and don’t forget game theory, graph theory and convex optimization. But it doesn’t stop there. You’ll need to dive into Bayesian statistics, information theory. Still isn’t enough. Turns out, you will need pure math as well: measure theory, topology, homology, group, field, and rings. At some point, you realize this is still not enough and now you need to think more like Andrew Wiles. So you go on to tackle some seriously hard topics such as combinatorics and computational complexity theory. What is all good for in the end? Oh right, to prove some regret bound that absolutely no one cares about. What was the regret bound for ADAM again? It's right in the paper, Theorem 1, cited 200k times, and nobody as far as I'm aware of even knows what it is.",

It does so with only **0.1% of the parameters &amp; &gt;100x faster inference times** than the closest competitor, and with an **extremely small training corpus of just 34 dynamical systems** \\- in our minds a paradigm shift in time series foundation models.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d46h9deagorf1.png?width=1791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a86714f6e8d7eb269224c0e06ac317f405dfbee\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mullm71cgorf1.png?width=1436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e53055fcc8b1d2f77da88c3896a95d65f3fac893\n\nIt even outperforms, or is at least on par with, major TS foundation models like Chronos on forecasting diverse empirical time series, like weather, traffic, or medical data, typically used to train TS FMs. This is surprising, cos DynaMix’ training corpus consists \\*solely\\* of simulated limit cycles or chaotic systems, no empirical data at all!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8twn70e2horf1.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20a7a7721a29d80bc2f01077b6e8684b54ce21ef\n\nAnd no, it’s neither based on Transformers nor Mamba – **it’s a new type of mixture-of-experts architecture** based on the recently introduced **AL-RNN** (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper\\_files/paper/2024/file/40cf27290cc2bd98a428b567ba25075c-Paper-Conference.pdf).

    "content": "Hi guys,\n\nThis post is about figuring out if RoPE overly constrains the K/Q spaces and if it decreases its effective dimensionality, by forcing a high condition number on the K/Q matrices.\n\nJust to give a bit of context, I'm trying to create a hierarchical BERT encoder (a kind of [CLS] embedding merger), and was trying to figure out a way to encode token (= sentence embeddings) position, because RoPE was designed for a kind of exponential decay that is not particularly relevant to my use case.\n\nDigging a bit deeper into the theory behind RoPE, I realized that specialized attention heads that focus on, say, position-insensitive semantical stuff need to project the embedding vectors in a space where the RoPE matrix will not mess them up. That's to say, the projected vectors will be heavily biased towards having information in the last components (where low-frequency rotation occur). \nThe opposite happens for positional encoding heads (I think a Gemma paper mentions them), that project embeddings so they are head-heavy instead of tail-heavy (not even sure this is correct english stuff, I am ESL).\n\nFrom an outside perspective, it seems quite sub-optimal: attention scores are -for these cases- based on low-dimensional (effectively) dot products.\n\nSo, 2 (and a half) questions here:\n\n1. Does it really matter? My prior is with yes, because I once computed the condition numbers of projection matrices in transformers with learned position embeddings and I found them to be very low (I guess they were &lt; 10 at each layer for quite tiny transformers, even though I think they would get bigger for decent ones). Curious about your thoughts though.\n\n2. What about a mitigation strategy like having the attention head 'choose' the base rate of the RoPE? A very simple strategy would be to make it dependent on the barycenter of the norm of K/Q projection matrices' rows. Meaning: if the projection matrices tends to give more importance to the first components of the raw embedding, we consider that the base rate should be higher. This would cause a transformer-wide bias towards having position-dependent information at the beginning of embeddings.\n\n3. Have I totally misunderstood RoPE?\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on that matter.",

    "content": "**🆕 What’s New**  \n  \nApple research just introduced Manzano (Spanish for “apple tree” 🍏) — a unified multimodal LLM that both understands images and generates them inside the same autoregressive loop.  \nInstead of separate perception and generation models, one decoder predicts the next token — text or image — then renders pixels with an auxiliary diffusion decoder.  \nThe paper reports state-of-the-art results among unified models and competitive performance against specialist systems, especially on text-rich benchmarks.  \n  \n**⚙️ How It Works**  \n  \nHybrid vision tokenizer in front of the LLM: a single vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters producing continuous embeddings for understanding and discrete tokens for generation.  \n  \nThe unified LLM decoder accepts text tokens and/or image embeddings and auto-regressively predicts the next token; a diffusion image decoder turns predicted tokens into pixels.  \n  \nThree-stage training (pre-training → continued pre-training → SFT) on mixed text/vision data; the embedding table is extended with a 64K image-token codebook aligned by finite scalar quantization.  \n  \n**✨ What Makes It Distinct**  \n  \nHybrid tokenizer, single encoder: understanding and generation tokens come from one encoder in a shared semantic space (no dual-tokenizer conflict).  \n  \nDecoupled roles: the LLM decoder handles high-level semantics; the diffusion decoder handles pixel fidelity — letting each scale independently.  \n  \nExplicit scaling: LLM decoder scaled from 300M→30B params with steady gains; diffusion decoder scaled for stronger structure in human evals.  \n  \n**📌 Why It Matters**  \n  \nOne model for “see + draw” → simpler architecture, better language–vision alignment, easier product integration.  \n  \nShared encoder + decoupled renderer → a practical path to scale without sacrificing understanding (a weak point for earlier unified models).  \n  \nIf these results generalize, future assistants that read, reason, edit &amp; generate in one loop could become the new default for multimodal work.",

I believe sharing experiences could be extremely useful, so here are two from me to kick things off:\n\n\nRole: AI Researcher (time-series, tabular)\nCompany: Mid-sized, healthcare \nWorkflow: All the data sits in an in-house db, and most of the research work is done using jupyter and pycharm/cursor.\nWe use MLFlow for experiment tracking.\nResources are allocated using run.ai (similiar to colab).\nOur workflow is generally something like: exporting the desired data from production db to s3, and research whatever. Once we have a production ready model, we work with the data engineers towards deployment (e.g ETLs, model API). Eventually, model outputs are saved in the production db and can be used whenever.\n  \n\nRole: Phd student\nCompany: Academia research lab\nWorkflow: Nothing concrete really, you get access to resources using a slurm server, other than that you pretty much on your own.\nPretty straightforward python scripts were used to download and preprocess the data, the processed data was spilled directly into disk.\nA pretty messy pytorch code and several local MLFlow repos.\n\n\nThere’re still many components that I find myself implement from scratch each time, like EDA, error analysis, production monitoring (model performance/data shifts). Usually it is pretty straightforward stuff which takes a lot of time and it feels far from ideal.\n\nWhat are your experiences?",

    "content": "**TL;DR.** We open-sourced **SyGra**, a graph-oriented framework for building *reproducible* synthetic data pipelines. Pipelines are defined as graphs (nodes = LLM calls/transforms/samplers; edges = conditional/parallel/loops). Two modes: YAML + CLI or Python library. Integrates with vLLM, HF TGI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama; HF-native I/O (streaming), provenance, schema-aware outputs.\n\n**Motivation.** High-quality LLM datasets are scarce, costly, and often sensitive; teams also need fine-grained control over task structure (SFT/DPO, tool use, multi-agent, multimodal). In practice, scaling “notebook pipelines” breaks down: you end up hand-wiring branching/looping flows, juggling multiple inference backends/APIs, and doing ad-hoc validation/schema checks—without resumability, sharding, or streaming. We wanted a **unified, reusable graph abstraction** that captures how data work actually happens (nodes/edges, subgraphs), automates **quality tagging** (heuristics + LLM-based scoring), and emits **schema-conformant, OASST-style** records—so teams can reproduce, audit, and evolve pipelines instead of rewriting glue code.\n\n**Design.**\n\n* **Graph model:** reusable subgraphs, branching, loops; deterministic configs\n* **Execution:** pluggable model clients (vLLM/TGI/Azure/Ollama), Triton-compatible\n* **Data I/O:** Hugging Face datasets (streaming), local files; schema &amp; metadata tracking\n* **Reproducibility:** explicit configs, seeds, artifact paths; CLI runs are fully logged\n\n**Use cases.** Bootstrapping SFT/DPO datasets; agent simulation &amp; tool-use evals; multimodal assembly (image→Q&amp;A, audio→text) etc.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Code (Apache-2.0) &amp; README: [github.com/ServiceNow/SyGra](http://github.com/ServiceNow/SyGra)\n* Paper (design rationale, examples): [arxiv.org/abs/2508.15432](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15432)\n* PyPI: [pypi.org/project/sygra/](http://pypi.org/project/sygra/)\n\n**Disclosure.** I’m part of the team.

In the code, there is also a lot more than in the paper, lots of other ideas that we have tried but did not report, also potential interesting follow-up ideas that we don't want to publish now.\n\nI saw in some other papers, that they provide a link to an anonymized repo (via https://anonymous.4open.science/). That gives us some more time to maybe also clean up the code further after the submission deadline, as I think we can still update that (right?). So this seems to be a better option?\n\nOr we can just make a statement that we will release the code when it is accepted. So then the reviewers cannot check it right now.\n\nAlso, the code makes use of multiple frameworks which are (mostly) only used by our research group (even though they are public, and could be used by anyone), so it is pretty obvious from whom this work is.

Or, train a router with an objective to maximize response quality, keeping generation speed up, while minimizing cost.\n\nEither way you’d have a single model, with fairly coherent tone and knowledge, that based deployment constraints (speed requirements, memory/compute limits) can be adjusted to be more, or less, linear on the fly.",

I've been working on addressing a persistent pain point in RL gaming research - the setup complexity and limited scope of training environments.\n\n**SDLArch-RL** is a unified RL environment that integrates multiple console emulators (N64, PS2, Dreamcast, GameCube) with standard ML frameworks. Key technical features:\n\n* **Gymnasium-compliant interface** \\- drop-in replacement for existing workflows\n* **Stable-Baselines3 integration** \\- works out-of-the-box with PPO, SAC, TD3, etc.\n* **Efficient state management** \\- leverages native emulator save states for fast episode resets\n* **Configurable observation spaces** \\- raw pixels, processed features, or memory states\n* **Action space mapping** \\- handles complex controller inputs to discrete/continuous actions\n\nCurrently supports 4 emulator backends with plans for modern console integration (PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U). The environment abstracts away emulator-specific APIs while preserving access to low-level features when needed.\n\n**Technical implementation highlights:**\n\n* SDL-based architecture for minimal overhead\n* Memory mapping support for game-specific feature extraction\n* Reproducible training through deterministic save state handling\n* Multi-game training capabilities within single environment instance\n\nThis opens up training on thousands of diverse games vs. the typical handful of custom environments. Particularly useful for transfer learning studies, multi-task RL, and curriculum learning research.\n\nHappy to discuss technical details or answer implementation questions.

    "content": "I wanted to share a personal project I've been working on for the past few months and get some feedback from the community. My goal was to build a stable, interactive system for video prediction by cleanly separating the perception and dynamics modeling. \n\n**The Core Architecture**\n\nThe pipeline processes a live camera feed. The main idea is to avoid expensive end-to-end training and create a more modular system.\n\n* **Frozen VAE (Perception):** I'm using the pre-trained Stable Diffusion VAE to encode frames into a latent space. By keeping it frozen, the \"perceptual manifold\" is stable, which makes learning the dynamics much easier.\n* **Three-Stage LSTM System (Dynamics):** This is where I tried to do something a bit different. Instead of one big LSTM, I'm using a hierarchy:\n   * A **Pattern LSTM** observes short sequences of latents to find basic temporal patterns.\n   * A **Compression LSTM** takes these patterns and learns a dense, compressed representation.\n   * A **Central LSTM** takes this compressed state and predicts the next latent step (Δz).\n\n**\\*NOTE:** This pipeline is capable of ALOT more than just a simple prediction model. For this project I solely focused on the vision aspect. \n\n**Performance and Results**\n\nThe whole system runs at an interactive 4-6 FPS on my consumer hardware and has a simple PyQT GUI to show the live camera feed next to the model's prediction. With better hardware i'm hoping to hit 24 FPS, but balling on a budget right now.\n\nMy main focus was on perceptual quality over raw pixel accuracy. The most encouraging result was in multi-step open-loop rollouts, where the model achieved a **peak SSIM of 0.84**. I was really happy to see this, as it's a result that's competitive with some established benchmarks on standardized datasets (like KTH).\n\n**Link to Project:**\n\nI've documented the architecture, included the performance logs, and wrote a white paper in the GitHub repo if you want to see the technical details:\n\n[github](https://github.com/A1CST/VISION_VAE_OLM_3L_PCC_PREDICTION)",

    "title": "Overcoming accuracy limitations of Analog In-Memory Computing hardware",
    "content": "Our paper titled \"Analog Foundation Models\" from IBM Research and ETH Zurich just got accepted at NeurIPS, and I feel like the broader ML community is not aware of the potential Analog In-Memory Computing (AIMC) has, so I wanted to make a quick advertisement for the paper and the field as a whole.\n\nThe idea of using analog devices for computation in AI is pretty old, but never really took off because of many reasons such as scalability or complexity. However, recently, research labs from Stanford or IBM Research have demonstrated very simple and scalable Analog In-Memory Computing chips that have strong potential to harness the benefits of AIMC \\[1-3\\].\n\n**What's the problem with modern architectures such as GPUs?**  \nIn a conventional computer architecture, you have your memory and your processing unit separated by a bus, over which you send data back and forth. This is extremely power consuming especially in scenarios where you repeatedly need to access \\*a lot of data\\*. This is the case for LLMs: During inference, you need to constantly fetch the weights, KV cache, and activations from DRAM into your local SRAM-based caches, do the computation, and eventually write back the data to DRAM. This is really expensive in terms of power and latency.  \n  \n**Can't we get rid of DRAM (only use SRAM)?**  \nYes we can, and in fact there are some companies that are already doing that (e.g. Cerebras). The downside of this approach is that SRAM has very poor density (and does not scale anymore) and cannot hold billions of weights in a reasonable footprint (you need huge wafers, and many of them).\n\n**How about you just do the computation directly inside a very dense memory itself?**  \nThis is the idea of AIMC: We propose to take the matrix-vector multiplication operation (one of the most prominent ops in NNs) and execute it directly inside non-volatile memory using Ohm's law (multiplication) and Kirchhoff's current law (summation). When combined with a scalable 3D memory technology like 3D NAND Flash and a scalable model architecture like MoEs, this opens up completely new use-cases for AI because you will be able to serve 100B+ models on a single chip with a low power budget (10s of W)\\[4\\].\n\n**What's the catch?**  \nThere is always one...In the case of AIMC, it is the fact that computations are noisy and non-deterministic at runtime. In fact, up to now, no one was sure whether LLMs can be made robust to the noise present in AIMC-based hardware. Our paper \"Analog Foundation Models\" \\[5\\] changes this. We show that we can repeat the pre-training process of already pre-trained foundation models on synthetic data while using hardware-aware training methods to enhance the robustness of these LLMs.\n\nWe show that in terms of accuracy, we can now compete with 4-bit quantized LLMs!\n\nThis is a significant step towards making AIMC a reality and there is still a long way to go, but we're still super excited to have broken this barrier, which is why I wanted to introduce this to the broader ML community here!\n\nDo you want to get an intro to this topic? Then I suggest [this fundamental article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-020-0655-z).\n\nDo you want to chat with me virtually or at NeurIPS? Just DM me!\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04992-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04992-8)  \n\\[2\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06337-5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06337-5)  \n\\[3\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-023-01010-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-023-01010-1)  \n\\[4\\] [https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00753-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00753-x)  \n\\[5\\] [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09663](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09663)",

    "content": "We are a student group from EPFL and we have been working on a tool called mmore, and thought it might be useful to share it here. Maybe the community will find it useful.\n\nYou can think of mmore as something in the spirit of [Docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling), but designed from the ground up to run natively on multi-GPU and multi-node setups. As the backend OCR for PDFs (and images) we use [Surya](https://github.com/datalab-to/surya), which we’ve found to be both very accurate and fast. For those with limited GPU resources, we also provide a lightweight “fast” mode. It skips OCR (so it cannot process scanned files) but still works well for born-digital documents.\n\nIn a [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11937) we released a few months ago, we showed that mmore achieves both speed and accuracy gains over Docling (maybe this has changed by now with the latest Granite-Docling). Right now, it supports a broad range of formats: PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, MD, EML (emails), TXT, HTML, as well as videos and audio (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, MP3, WAV, AAC).\n\nThe use cases are flexible. For example:\n\n* Unlocking text and image data from previously unprocessed files, enabling larger dataset creation (similar to what Docling + HuggingFace did a few days ago with [finepdfs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/finepdfs)).\n* Running text or multimodal RAG directly over your own document collections.\n\nWe are sharing this mainly to invite ideas and feedback from the community. If you see opportunities, have suggestions, or even just thoughts on directions we should explore, we’d love to hear them.

    "content": "Large Language Models shine at step-by-step reasoning in text, but struggle when tasks require visual changes. Existing methods often produce messy, incoherent results.\n\nWe introduce Uni-CoT, the first unified Chain-of-Thought framework that handles both image understanding + generation to enable coherent visual reasoning \\[as shown in Figure 1\\]. Our model even can supports NanoBanana–style geography reasoning \\[as shown in Figure 2\\]!\n\nSpecifically, we use **one unified architecture** (inspired by Bagel/Omni/Janus) to support multi-modal reasoning. This minimizes discrepancy between reasoning trajectories and visual state transitions, enabling coherent cross-modal reasoning. However, the multi-modal reasoning with unified model raise a large burden on computation and model training.\n\n# To solve it, we propose a hierarchical Macro–Micro CoT:\n\n* **Macro-Level CoT** → global planning, decomposing a task into subtasks.\n* **Micro-Level CoT** → executes subtasks as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**, reducing token complexity and improving efficiency.\n\nThis **structured decomposition** shortens reasoning trajectories and lowers cognitive (and computational) load.\n\n# With this desigin, we build a novel training strategy for our Uni-CoT:\n\n* **Macro-level modeling**: refined on interleaved text–image sequences for global planning.\n* **Micro-level modeling**: auxiliary tasks (action generation, reward estimation, etc.) to guide efficient learning.\n* **Node-based reinforcement learning** to stabilize optimization across modalities.\n\n# Results:\n\n* Training efficiently only on **8 × A100 GPUs**\n* Inference efficiently only on 1 **× A100 GPU**\n* Achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on reasoning-driven benchmarks for image generation &amp; editing.\n\n# Resource:\n\nOur paper：[https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05606](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05606)\n\nGithub repo: [https://github.com/Fr0zenCrane/UniCoT](https://github.com/Fr0zenCrane/UniCoT)\n\nProject page: [https://sais-fuxi.github.io/projects/uni-cot/](https://sais-fuxi.github.io/projects/uni-cot/)",

After a very long review process (almost a year), it finally reached the “AQ” stage.\n\nNow I’m curious—how do people in the community actually see TIP these days?\nSome of my colleagues say it’s still one of the top journals in vision, basically right after TPAMI. Others think it’s kind of outdated and not really read much anymore.\n\nAlso, how would you compare it to the major conferences (CVPR/ICCV/ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI)? Is publishing in TIP seen as on par with those, or is it considered more like the “second-tier” conferences (WACV, BMVC, etc.)?\n\nI’m close to graduation, so maybe I’m overthinking this. I know the contribution and philosophy of the work itself matters more than the venue. But I’d still love to hear how people generally view TIP these days, both in academia and in the field.\n\nThanks!\n",

    "title": "[R] “Evaluating Deepfake Detectors in the Wild”: Fraudster Attacks (ICML 2025 Workshop paper)",
    "content": "Hi Reddit! \n\nHave you ever thought how difficult it is to determine whether a photo is *genuine* or a **deepfake**? You might think discriminative tasks are easier than generative ones, so detection should be straightforward. Or, on the contrary, diffusion models are now so good that detection is impossible. In our work, we reveal the current state of the war on deepfakes. In short, SOTA open-source detectors fail under real-world conditions.\n\nI work as an ML engineer at a leading platform for KYC and liveness detection. In our setting, you must decide from a short verification video whether the person is who they claim to be. Deepfakes are one of the biggest and most challenging problems here. We are known for our robust anti-deepfake solutions, and I’m not trying to flex, I just want to say that we work on this problem daily and see what fraudsters actually try in order to bypass verification. For years we kept trying to apply research models to our data, and nothing really worked. For example, all research solutions were less robust than a simple zero-shot CLIP baseline. We kept wondering whether the issue lay with our data, our setup, or the research itself. It seems that a lot of deepfake research overlooks key *wild* conditions.\n\n**Core issue: robustness to OOD data.**\n\nEven a small amount of data from the test distribution leaking into the training set (say 1k images out of a 1M-image test pool) makes it trivial to achieve great metrics, and experienced computer vision experts can push  AUC to \\~99.99. Without peeking, however, the task becomes i*ncredibly hard*. Our paper demonstrates this with a simple, reproducible pipeline:\n\n1. **Deepfakes**. If you don’t already have them, we built a large image-level dataset using two SOTA face-swapping methods: Inswapper and Simswap.\n2. **Real world conditions.** We use small transformations that are imperceptible to humans and that we constantly see in the real world: downscaling (resize), upscaling (with some AI), and compression (JPEG). These are indistinguishable for humans, so detectors must be robust to them.\n3. **Evaluation.** Test model under different setups, e.g.: 1) only real. model have to predict only real labels 2) real vs fake 3) real vs compressed fake ... and others. It sounds easy, but every model we tested had at least one setting where performance drops to near-random.\n\nSo we’re not just releasing another benchmark or yet another deepfake dataset. We present a pipeline that *mirrors what fraudsters do*, what we actually observe in production. We’re releasing all code, our dataset (&gt;500k fake images), and even a small deepfake game where you can test yourself as a detector.\n\nFor more details, please see the full paper. Is there a silver-bullet solution to deepfake detection? We don’t claim one here, but we do share a teaser result: a promising setup using zero-shot VLMs for detection. I’ll post about that (our second ICML workshop paper) separately.\n\nIf you’re interested in deepfake research and would like to chat, or even collaborate – don’t hesitate to reach out. Cheers!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vi3qxnp38ipf1.jpg?width=6099&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55fe99a72bb0614bc560e5553c2eaf20cbd3132c",

    "content": "This is a hard question that I imagine is being thought about a lot, but maybe there are answers already.\n\nTraining a model to consume a query in text, reason about it, and spit out an answer is quite demanding and requires the model to have a lot of knowledge.\n\nIs there some domain that requires less knowledge but allows the model to learn reasoning/agency, without the model having to become huge?\n\nI think mathematical reasoning is a good example, it is a much smaller subset of language and has narrower objectives (assuming you don't want it to invent a new paradigm and just operate within an existing one).\n\nThere might be others?",

    "content": "Some of my AAAI submissions got rejected in phase 1. To be honest, my reviews are good; maybe too harsh in the scores, but at least they read the papers and made their points. Now I wonder where to resubmit (enhancing the papers a bit with this feedback, but without much time because I work in the industry). \n\nI think ICLR will be crazy this year (many NIPS and AAAI work), so I do not know if the process will be as random as the one in AAAI. As for submissions being \"9 pages or fewer\", do people usually fill 9 pages or is okey to make less? I only saw this in RLC before (and other ICLR). Also, I always have doubts about the rebuttal period here, is it still the case that I can update my experiments and discuss with reviewers? Do reviewers still engage in discussion in these overloaded times?\n\nLast, what about AISTATS? I never submitted there, but it might be a good way to escape from these super big conferences. However, I am afraid papers will not get as much visibility. I heard this is a prestigious conference, but then almost never gets cited in e.g., job offers.\n\nI am a bit lost with AI/ML conferences lately. What are your thoughts on this submission cycle?",

Training ensemble model combining:\n\n- Linguistic features (sentiment, readability, vocabulary richness)\n- Temporal patterns (review timing, account age, posting frequency)\n- Semantic analysis (topic consistency, specificity of complaints/praise)\n\n**Initial Results:**\n\n- 78% accuracy on test set\n- High precision on obvious bot reviews (0.91)\n- Struggles with sophisticated fakes that mimic real review patterns\n\n**Interesting Discoveries:**\n\n**Fake Review Patterns:**\n\n- Excessive use of product name in review text\n- Generic praise without specific use cases\n- Perfect grammar (real users make typos)\n- Reviews clustered around same timestamps\n\n**Real Review Indicators:**\n\n- Specific complaints about minor issues\n- Mentions of use context (\"bought for my college dorm\")\n- Photos that show actual usage wear\n- Mixed sentiment (likes some aspects, dislikes others)\n\n**Current Challenges:**\n\n- Regional language differences affect detection\n- Incentivized reviews blur line between real/fake\n- Sophisticated fake reviewers are learning to mimic real patterns\n\nI've integrated this into Yaw AI (chrome extension I'm building) but still need significant improvement before it's reliable enough for general use. Sometimes flags legitimate reviews as suspicious and occasionally misses obvious fakes.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- Expand training data with international reviews\n- Implement active learning to improve edge cases\n- Add verification scoring instead of binary classification\n\nAnyone working on similar problems?

A lot of the attention in AI has been on agents and chatbots (e.g., Claude Code or Claude Desktop), and I think semantic data processing is not well-served by such tools (or frameworks designed for implementing such tools, like LangChain).\n\nAs I was working on some concrete semantic data processing problems and writing a lot of Python code (to call LLMs in a for loop, for example, and then adding more and more code to do things like I/O concurrency and caching), I wanted to figure out how to disentangle data processing pipeline logic from LLM orchestration. Functional programming primitives (map, reduce, etc.), common in data processing systems like MapReduce/Flume/Spark, seemed like a natural fit, so I implemented semantic versions of these operators. It's been pretty effective for the data processing tasks I've been trying to do.\n\nThis blog post (https://anishathalye.com/semlib/) shares some more details on the story here and elaborates what I like about this approach to semantic data processing. It also covers some of the related work in this area (like DocETL from Berkeley's EPIC Data Lab, LOTUS from Stanford and Berkeley, and Palimpzest from MIT's Data Systems Group).\n\nLike a lot of my past work, the software itself isn't all that fancy; but it might change the way you think!\n\nThe software is open-source at https://github.com/anishathalye/semlib. I'm very curious to hear the community's thoughts!",

    "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI know that in this community there are many experienced researchers and even reviewers for top-tier conferences. As a young researcher, I sincerely hope to learn from your perspectives and get some clarity on a few concerns I’ve been struggling with.\n\n**My first question:**  \nDoes a research paper always need to achieve *state-of-the-art (SOTA)* results—outperforming every existing method—to be accepted at an A\\* conference? I often feel that so many published papers present dazzling results, making it nearly impossible for newcomers to surpass them.\n\n**My second question, about fairness and accuracy in comparisons:**  \nWhen evaluating a new method, is it acceptable to compare primarily against the most “related,” “similar,” or “same-family” methods rather than the absolute SOTA? For example:\n\n* If I make a small modification to the Bagging procedure in Random Forest, would it be fair to compare only against other Bagging-based forests, rather than something fundamentally different like XGBoost (which is boosting-based)?\n* Similarly, if I improve a variant of SVM, is it reasonable to compare mainly with other margin-based or kernel methods, instead of tree-based models like Decision Trees?\n\nI understand that if my method only beats some similar baselines but does not surpass the global best-performing method, reviewers might see it as “meaningless” (since people naturally gravitate toward the top method). Still, I’d like to hear your thoughts: from an experienced researcher’s point of view, what is considered fair and convincing in such comparisons?\n\nThank you very much in advance for your time and advice.",

    "content": "I recently implemented the [Hierarchical Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734) (HRM) for educational purposes and applied it to a simple pathfinding task. You can watch the model solve boards step by step in the generated animated GIF.\n\nHRM is inspired by multi-timescale processing in the brain: a slower H module for abstract planning and a faster L module for low-level computation, both based on self-attention. HRM is an attempt to model reasoning in latent space.\n\nTo understand a bit better what drives the performance I ran a small ablation study. Key findings (full results in the README):\n\n* The biggest driver of performance (both accuracy and refinement ability) is training with more segments (outer-loop refinement), not architecture.\n* The two-timescale H/L architecture performs about the same as a single-module trained with BPTT.\n* Notably, H/L still achieves good performance/refinement without full BPTT, which could mean cheaper training.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/krychu/hrm](https://github.com/krychu/hrm)\n\nThis is of course a limited study on a relatively simple task, but I thought the results might be interesting to others exploring reasoning models.\n\nThe findings line up with the ARC Prize team's analysis: [https://arcprize.org/blog/hrm-analysis](https://arcprize.org/blog/hrm-analysis)\n\nBelow two examples of refinement in action: early steps explore solution with rough guesses, later steps make smaller and smaller corrections until the full path emerges:\n\n[20x20 board](https://i.redd.it/i1qi4l2vs3of1.gif)\n\n[30x30 board](https://i.redd.it/j6fpueovs3of1.gif)\n\n",

    "title": "[R] LLMs play a cooperative card game, coordination without communication",
    "content": "One of my favorite card games is called The Crew, which is a trick-taking game (like hearts) but cooperative. There's no table talk allowed, players have to coordinate silently (with limited options for in-game communication) - figuring out what their teammates are doing and why, and what they need to do to work together. I wondered what SOTA LLMs would do if you asked them to play. To make this work, I implemented a backend for the game logic and structured outputs so models play by submitting moves and reasoning at each turn. \n\nOriginally I wanted to re-create the 50 mission campaign, but models were so spotty on  mission 1 (the simplest possible mission) that I stuck to mission 1 and experimented with different configurations instead. I ran 8 OpenAI models on 10 different versions, ranging from very easy (random chance gets you there 2/3rds of the time) to very hard (random chance succeeds 0.5%), and gave each model ten trials on each mission.\n\nWhat I've found out:\n\n\\* Smaller models struggle both with gameplay, and with understanding their role on the team. In these missions, a designated player (the commander) has to win a designated card. But these models hate having to lose a trick for the sake of their teammate, even when that's how they win the game.\n\n[This does not \\\\\"help him secure the win and fulfill his task.\\\\\" It loses the game.](https://preview.redd.it/3lqyqf3tg1of1.png?width=2030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b57c0a46fee169e14dbf6fc0cda107024a11a59e)\n\n\\* GPT-4o-mini (worst model so far) plays randomly on easy setups and worse than randomly on harder ones. GPT-4o-mini in particular loses the game in the first turn almost 90% of the time in harder setups with GPT-5-nano and GPT-4.1-mini are close behind at 60-70%. \n\n[GREEN 1 is the lowest GREEN card in the game, so playing it straight away actually guarantees immediate failure.](https://preview.redd.it/fx5jqyhug1of1.png?width=2046&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da5d4abb5a7fcd4c1e8ee42c09d7acfb4a7ba5dc)\n\n\\* GPT-5 is self-aware enough to avoid the \"losing on the very first turn\" error, but actually did it on purpose once as a deliberate suicide when it saw that it couldn't win the game on the very first turn.\n\n[There are multiple turns in the game!](https://preview.redd.it/91qnnfuvg1of1.jpg?width=1900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebc98a3fbf4381c4a95f7e96ec2fa96f8e84692f)\n\n\\* The harder missions - which require coordination across multiple turns - absolutely cook the smaller models with &lt;10% win rates. Only GPT-5 is beating random chance on the harder missions (73% GPT-5 vs 4% random) \n\n\\* GPT-5 also found optimal 1-trick solutions to a couple of setups I thought required at least two tricks. Oops. So in a sense, we're above human performance in some areas.\n\n\\* ...But most of the time, GPT-5 generally screwed around for 3 or more tricks in puzzles it could have solved in 1. This is like solving a mate in one chess puzzle in 3 moves. It's not losing, but it's not exactly showing a mastery of the game.\n\n\\* The lack of goal-oriented behavior (or risk-averse hesitation) on GPT-5's part means that GPT-5-mini actually performs better if we count speed (number of turns) to win as criteria and grade on optimal play (winning in the least number of turns, rather than just winning.)\n\nI published the repo and did a write-up with some graphs and demos here: [https://ekkarpinski.github.io/LLMCrew/](https://ekkarpinski.github.io/LLMCrew/)\n\n",

I have multiple sets of data from the same collection process, where I use some sets for training and testing and keep the remaining ones for evaluating generalization. Within the training and testing sets, the model performs well, but when I test on the held-out dataset from the same collection, the R² value often becomes negative , even though the mean absolute error and root mean square error remain reasonable. I have experimented with several feature engineering strategies, including section-based, time-based, and distance-based windowing, and I have tried using raw PCI data as well. I also tested different window lengths and overlap percentages, but the results remain inconsistent. I use the same data for a classification task, the models perform very well and generalize properly, yet for PCI regression, the generalization fails despite using the same features and data source. In some cases, removing features like latitude, longitude, or timestamps caused performance to drop significantly, which raises concerns that the model might be unintentionally relying on location and time information instead of learning meaningful patterns from sensor signals. I have also experimented with different models, including traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, but the issue persists. I suspect the problem may be related to the variance of the target PCI values across datasets, potential data leakage caused by overlapping windows, or possibly a methodological flaw in how the evaluation is performed. I want to understand whether it is common in research to report only the R² values on the train/test splits from the same dataset, or whether researchers typically validate on entirely separate held-out sets as well. Given that classification on the same data works fine but regression fails to generalize, I am trying to figure out if this is expected behavior in PCI regression tasks or if I need to reconsider my entire evaluation strategy.",

    "content": "I am working on a project where I need to extract transaction data from Bank Statement PDFs. 80% of my working PDFs are digitally generated so to handle those I put the Regex approach, where I first extract the text into a txt file and then run Regex on this data to extract data in a meaningful format \\[Date, Particulars, Credit/Debit amount, Balance\\]. The challenge is that the Regex approach is brittle, and very sensitive to formats. So every bank requires a new Regex plus any little change in the format tomorrow by the bank will break the pipeline.\n\nI want to make a pipeline which is agnostic to bank-format and is capable of extracting the info from the PDFs. I cannot use any 3rd party APIs as the bank data is sensitive and we want to keep everything on internal servers.\n\nHence, I have been exploring ways in Open Source models to built this pipeline. After doing some research, I landed on LayoutLMv3 Model which can essentially label the Tokens based on their location on the page so if we are able to train the model on our data it should be able to tag every token on the page and that should do it, but the challenge here is that this model is sensitive to reading order and fails on few bank formats.\n\nSince then I have explored MinerU but that failed as well, it isolated the transaction content table but later failed to extract data in orderly fashion as it could not differentiate between multiple lines of transactions.\n\nNow I am working with YOLOv8 which I am training to identify transaction rows and amount columns using BBox and then I will pull the info from these BBox intersection. But the confidence here is not very high.\n\nHas anyone here faced similar challenge? Can anyone help me with some solution or approach. It would be a great help!\n\nKnow that the most of the PDFs don't have any defined table, it's just text hanging in air with lot of whitespace. I need a solve for Scanned PDFs as well \\[integrated with OCR\\]",

A friend and I recently tried writing a paper for a NeurIPS workshop, but ran into some issues.  \nWe had both a lot on our plate and probably used LLMs a bit too much. When evaluating our models, close to the deadline, we caught up on some bugs that made the data unreliable. We also had plenty of those bugs along the way. I feel like we shot ourselves in the foot but that's a lesson learned the way. Also, it made me realise the negative effects it could have had if those bugs had been kept uncaught.\n\nI've been interning in some big tech companies, and so I have rather high-standard for clean code. Keeping up with those standards would be unproductive at our scale, but I must say I've struggled finding a middle ground between speed of execution and code's reliability.\n\nFor researchers on this sub, do you use LLMs at all when writing ML experiments? If yes, how much so? Any structure you follow for effective experimentation (writing (ugly) code is not always my favorite part)? When doing experimentation, what structure do you tend to follow w.r.t collaboration?\n\nThank you :)\n\n",

Even as language models become more capable, one challenge remains stubbornly hard to fully solve: hallucinations. By this we mean instances where a model confidently generates an answer that isn’t true. Our new research paper⁠(opens in a new window) argues that language models hallucinate because standard training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty.\nChatGPT also hallucinates. GPT‑5 has significantly fewer hallucinations especially when reasoning⁠, but they still occur. Hallucinations remain a fundamental challenge for all large language models, but we are working hard to further reduce them.”",

    "content": "Skip connections and residual blocks have been ubiquitous in the ML field ever since the original ResNets were published. I think it's fair to say most people agree skip connections help, but at a glance, the design of the residual blocks themselves is still something that differs from paper to paper.\n\nThe most recent \"innovation\" is splitting channel mixing from spatial mixing, which is what ConvNeXt does in an attempt to mimic transformers. Other models that also claim SotA-ish performance, however, do not necessarily follow suit. NFNet, for example, employs grouped 3x3 convolution layers, good old normal bottlenecks (not inverted) and channel attention (Squeeze-and-Excitation).\n\nIf we look at modern LLMs, they all have residual blocks that look very similar, but with one or two minor differences that often look arbitrary.\n\nI think residual block design is one of those things that people don't really pay much attention to since it generally works well enough regardless of what you do, but at some point it does look like we're just making semi-random decisions based on semi-random observations. Why the block is designed in the way it is is rarely a point of concern.\n\nI've tried looking for papers making direct comparisons between different design choices, but I couldn't really find anything conclusive.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/),\n\nI'm a final-year undergrad exploring multimodal systems, and I wanted to share a project I've built and open-sourced. It’s an end-to-end pipeline designed to tackle video dubbing for low-resource languages, using Telugu as the initial target. The system translates speech from an English video while preserving the original speaker's vocal identity and syncing their lips to the new audio.\n\n* **GitHub Repo:** [\\[GitHub\\]](https://github.com/M-SRIKAR-VARDHAN/speech-to-speech-with-lipsync)\n* **Full Technical Write-up:** [\\[writeup\\]](https://medium.com/@srikarvardhan2005/speech-to-speech-translation-with-lip-sync-425d8bb74530)\n* **Demo Video:** [\\[Demo\\]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l6jZEDdmUzr9VhfYkvoVdaXJSSipN-nm?usp=sharing)\n\nThe core technical challenge was achieving voice preservation without access to large, speaker-specific datasets typically required for high-fidelity voice cloning. After a dead-end attempting a direct S2S architecture inspired by Translatotron, I found that using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as a post-processing step on a generic TTS output was a surprisingly practical and data-efficient solution.\n\nThe final pipeline is structured as follows:\n\n1. **ASR:** Whisper for robust transcription.\n2. **NMT:** Meta's NLLB for English-to-Telugu translation.\n3. **TTS:** Meta's MMS model to synthesize the base Telugu audio.\n4. **Voice Conversion:** A trained RVC model converts the timbre of the synthetic speech to match the original speaker.\n5. **Lip Sync:** Wav2Lip aligns the video frames to the new audio.\n\nMy main takeaway is that RVC seems to function as a very effective \"style transfer\" layer for voice, making it a viable tool for projects where full voice cloning is computationally or data-prohibitive.\n\nI'm sharing this to start a discussion and get feedback from the community on this approach. I'm particularly curious about two points:\n\n1. Has anyone else experimented with using RVC in a more formal pipeline, and what were the qualitative limitations you encountered?\n2. Are there newer or more robust alternatives to Wav2Lip for lip-syncing that maintain good performance without requiring massive computational resources?\n\nAny thoughts on the architecture or suggestions for improvement would be highly appreciated.

    "content": "Been collecting data on ML inference performance in trusted execution environments and thought the numbers might be useful for others dealing with similar constraints.\n\n**Context:** Fraud detection models processing ~10M daily transactions, needed hardware-level isolation for compliance reasons.\n\nAfter 3 months of production data, seeing 5-8% performance overhead compared to standard deployment. This is way better than the 30-40% overhead reported in older papers about SGX.\n\nThe interesting technical challenge was memory management. TEE environments have strict memory limits and different allocation patterns than standard containers. Had to completely rewrite our batching logic - what worked fine with dynamic batching in regular pods caused constant OOM errors in enclaves.\n\n**Model optimization discoveries:**\n\n- ONNX runtime worked, pytorch was too memory heavy\n- Preprocessing became the bottleneck, not inference\n- Had to keep models under 8GB total memory\n- P95 latency went from 12ms to 13ms\n\nTried multiple approaches including raw SGX implementation and phala's abstraction layer. The attestation complexity alone makes raw implementation painful.\n\n**For those working on similar problems:**\nProfile your entire pipeline, not just model inference. Data transformation overhead in isolated environments is real.\n\n**Technical question for the community:** \nHow are you handling model updates in TEE environments? The attestation requirements make standard blue-green deployments complicated. Currently doing full enclave restarts but that means brief downtime.\n\nAlso curious if anyone's tried running transformer models larger than 1B params in TEE. Memory constraints seem prohibitive but maybe there are tricks I'm missing?",

    "title": "[P] Arbitrary Order Automatic Differentiation for PyTorch",
    "content": "I’m excited to present **thoad** (short for Py**T**orch **H**igh **O**rder **A**utomatic **D**ifferentiation), a Python only library that computes arbitrary order partial derivatives directly on a PyTorch computational graph. The package has been developed within a bachelor's research project at Universidad Pontificia de Comillas - ICAI, and we are considering publishing a future academic article reviewing the mathematical details and the implementation design.\n\nAt its core, thoad takes a one output, many inputs view of the graph and pushes high order derivatives back to the leaf tensors. Although a 1→N problem can be rewritten as 1→1 by concatenating flattened inputs, as in functional approaches such as `jax.jet` or `functorch`, thoad’s graph aware formulation enables:\n\n* Working with smaller **pieced external derivatives**\n* An optimization based on **unifying independent dimensions** (especially batch).\n\nThis delivers **asymptotically better scaling** with respect to order and batch size (respectively).\n\nAdditionally, we compute derivatives with a *vectorial* approach rather than component by component, which makes our pure PyTorch implementation possible. Consequently, the implementation stays at a high level, written entirely in Python and using **PyTorch** as its only dependency. Avoiding custom C++ or CUDA has a very positive impact on the long-term maintainability of the package.\n\nThe package is already available to be installed from **GitHub** or **PyPI**:\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/mntsx/thoad](https://github.com/mntsx/thoad)\n\nIn our benchmarks, thoad **outperforms** torch.autograd for **Hessian calculations even on CPU**. See the repository *examples/benchmarks* to check the comparisons and run them in your own hardware.\n\n**thoad** is designed to align closely with PyTorch’s interface philosophy, so running the high order backward pass is practically indistinguishable from calling PyTorch’s own `backward`. When you need finer control, you can keep or reduce Schwarz symmetries, group variables to restrict mixed partials, and fetch the exact mixed derivative you need. Shapes and independence metadata are also exposed to keep interpretation straightforward.\n\n# USING THE PACKAGE\n\n**thoad** exposes two primary interfaces for computing high-order derivatives:\n\n1. `thoad.backward`: a function-based interface that closely resembles `torch.Tensor.backward`. It provides a quick way to compute high-order gradients without needing to manage an explicit controller object, but it offers only the core functionality (derivative computation and storage).\n2. `thoad.Controller`: a class-based interface that wraps the output tensor’s subgraph in a controller object. In addition to performing the same high-order backward pass, it gives access to advanced features such as fetching specific mixed partials, inspecting batch-dimension optimizations, overriding backward-function implementations, retaining intermediate partials, and registering custom hooks.\n\nExample of autodifferentiation execution via `thoad.backward`\n\n    import torch\n    import thoad\n    from torch.nn import functional as F\n    \n    #### Normal PyTorch workflow\n    X = torch.rand(size=(10,15), requires_grad=True)\n    Y = torch.rand(size=(15,20), requires_grad=True)\n    Z = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(query=X, key=Y.T, value=Y.T)\n    \n    #### Call thoad backward\n    order = 2\n    thoad.backward(tensor=Z, order=order)\n    \n    #### Checks\n    ## check derivative shapes\n    for o in range(1, 1 + order):\n       assert X.hgrad[o - 1].shape == (Z.numel(), *(o * tuple(X.shape)))\n       assert Y.hgrad[o - 1].shape == (Z.numel(), *(o * tuple(Y.shape)))\n    ## check first derivatives (jacobians)\n    fn = lambda x, y: F.scaled_dot_product_attention(x, y.T, y.T)\n    J = torch.autograd.functional.jacobian(fn, (X, Y))\n    assert torch.allclose(J[0].flatten(), X.hgrad[0].flatten(), atol=1e-6)\n    assert torch.allclose(J[1].flatten(), Y.hgrad[0].flatten(), atol=1e-6)\n    ## check second derivatives (hessians)\n    fn = lambda x, y: F.scaled_dot_product_attention(x, y.T, y.T).sum()\n    H = torch.autograd.functional.hessian(fn, (X, Y))\n    assert torch.allclose(H[0][0].flatten(), X.hgrad[1].sum(0).flatten(), atol=1e-6)\n    assert torch.allclose(H[1][1].flatten(), Y.hgrad[1].sum(0).flatten(), atol=1e-6)\n\nExample of autodifferentiation execution via `thoad.Controller`\n\n    import torch\n    import thoad\n    from torch.nn import functional as F\n    \n    #### Normal PyTorch workflow\n    X = torch.rand(size=(10,15), requires_grad=True)\n    Y = torch.rand(size=(15,20), requires_grad=True)\n    Z = F.scaled_dot_product_attention(query=X, key=Y.T, value=Y.T)\n    \n    #### Instantiate thoad controller and call backward\n    order = 2\n    controller = thoad.Controller(tensor=Z)\n    controller.backward(order=order, crossings=True)\n    \n    #### Fetch Partial Derivatives\n    ## fetch T0 and T1 2nd order derivatives\n    partial_XX, _ = controller.fetch_hgrad(variables=(X, X))\n    partial_YY, _ = controller.fetch_hgrad(variables=(Y, Y))\n    assert torch.allclose(partial_XX, X.hgrad[1])\n    assert torch.allclose(partial_YY, Y.hgrad[1])\n    ## fetch cross derivatives\n    partial_XY, _ = controller.fetch_hgrad(variables=(X, Y))\n    partial_YX, _ = controller.fetch_hgrad(variables=(Y, X))\n\n&gt;NOTE.

From my perspective, as the number of active researchers has increased, the number of well executed interesting ideas has also increased. I don't think we've hit a point where there's a clearly finite set of things to investigate in the field. \n\nI would also say essentially every paper I rejected was distinctly worse than those 3 or 4 papers. Papers I rejected were typically poorly motivated -- usually an architecture hack poorly situated in the broader landscape with no real story that explains this choice. Or, the paper completely missed an existing work that already did nearly exactly what they did. \n\nWhat has your experience been? ",

    "content": "Hey r/MachineLearning \n\nI had this idea and wanted to put it in a very simple and straightforward way, tried to make the paper easy to read and starter friendly! Also it shows my research partner focus on uncertainty measurement from metrology, which I think it’s not very widely addressed in ML and NLP! \n\nThe motivation here came while doing exploration at the Weights &amp; Biases Sunday cafe event in SF, where we were exploring their observability Weave Product. I think running loops and adding more complex tools that I did for the paper, should be production valuable and help in a bunch of ways, but most importantly, help with making small models\nMore useful and a kind of reasoning process of sorts. In the future it might be useful to make this loop inside the model before output layers, anybody think of any cools applications for such methods ? \n\n\n[Title]: Entropy-Guided Loop: Achieving Reasoning through Uncertainty-Aware Generation\n\n[Abstract]: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5× higher cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight, test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-k alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report (tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning, mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches 95\\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\\% of responses while improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00079\n\nIf you don’t like it, let me know!

    "content": "https://github.com/vitalops/datatune\n\nIntroducing Datatune, a Python library that enables row-wise transformations on tabular data using natural language prompts, powered by LLMs.\n\nUnlike tools that generate SQL or static scripts, Datatune is designed for per-row semantic operations on tabular data. It’s particularly useful for fuzzy logic tasks like classification, filtering, derived metrics, and text extraction - anything that’s hard to express in SQL but intuitive in plain English.\n\n### What it does\n\nYou write prompts like:\n\n* \"Extract categories from the product description and name\"\n* \"Keep only electronics products\"\n* \"Add a column called ProfitMargin = (Total Profit / Revenue) * 100\"\n\nDatatune interprets the prompt and applies the right operation (map, filter, or an LLM-powered agent pipeline) on your data using OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, or other LLMs via LiteLLM.\n\n### Key Features\n\n* Row-level map() and filter() operations using natural language\n* Agent interface for auto-generating multi-step transformations\n* Built-in support for Dask DataFrames (for scalability)\n* Works with multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, etc.)\n* Compatible with LiteLLM for flexibility across providers\n* Auto-token batching, metadata tracking, and smart pipeline composition\n\n### Token &amp; Cost Optimization\n\n* Datatune gives you explicit control over which columns are sent to the LLM, reducing token usage and API cost:\n* Use input_fields to send only relevant columns\n* Automatically handles batching and metadata internally\n* Supports setting tokens-per-minute and requests-per-minute limits\n* Defaults to known model limits (e.g., GPT-3.5) if not specified\n* This makes it possible to run LLM-based transformations over large datasets without incurring runaway costs.\n\n### Quick Example\n```python\nimport datatune as dt\nfrom datatune.llm.llm import OpenAI\n\nllm = OpenAI(model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\ndf = dd.read_csv(\"products.csv\")\n\n# Map step\nmapped = dt.map(\n    prompt=\"Extract categories from the description and name of product.\",\n    output_fields=[\"Category\", \"Subcategory\"],\n    input_fields=[\"Description\", \"Name\"]\n)(llm, df)\n\n# Filter step\nfiltered = dt.filter(\n    prompt=\"Keep only electronics products\",\n    input_fields=[\"Name\"]\n)(llm, mapped)\n\nresult = dt.finalize(filtered)\n```\n\nOr using the agent:\n\n```python\nagent = dt.Agent(llm)\ndf = agent.do(\"Add a column called ProfitMargin = (Total Profit / Total Revenue) * 100.\", df)\nresult = dt.finalize(df)\n```\n### Use Cases\n\n* Product classification from text fields\n* Filtering based on semantic conditions\n* Creating derived metrics using natural language\n* Review quality detection, support ticket triage\n* Anonymization (PII removal) when needed\n\n### Links\n\n* GitHub: https://github.com/vitalops/datatune\n* Docs: https://docs.datatune.ai\n* Examples: https://github.com/vitalops/datatune/tree/main/examples\n\nWe’re actively developing the project and would appreciate any feedback, bug reports, or feature requests via Github issues.\n.\n",

    "content": "\nPosting this because I wish someone had done the same when we started. Our lab needed to work with industry partners on sensitive datasets but legal restrictions meant we couldn't access the raw data.\n\nTraditional methods like differential privacy added too much noise for our research goals. Synthetic data was useless for our specific use case.\n\nWhat went good for us: deploying our models in trusted execution environments. Partners felt comfortable because data never left their control. We could iterate on models without seeing actual data values.\n\nTech setup through phala network was surprisingly direct. Only difficulty was adapting our workflow since you can't just print tensors to debug anymore. Had to get creative with logging aggregate statistics.\n\nUnexpected: our industry partnerships increased 3x because companies that previously wouldn't share data are now willing to collaborate. Turns out the privacy barrier was bigger than we realized.\n\nIf your research is stuck due to data access issues definitely worth exploring TEE options. Happy to share our deployment scripts if useful.",

Wondering if it's just me or if this is a universal developer experience.\n\nYou need specific training data for your model. Not the usual stuff you find on Kaggle or other public datasets, but something more niche or specialized, for e.g. financial data from a particular sector, medical datasets, etc. I try to find quality datasets, but most of the time, they are hard to find or license, and not the quality or requirements I am looking for.\n\nSo, how do you typically handle this? Do you use datasets free/open source? Do you use synthetic data? Do you use whatever might be similar, but may compromise training/fine-tuning?\n\nIm curious if there is a better way to approach this, or if struggling with data acquisition is just part of the AI development process we all have to accept. Do bigger companies have the same problems in sourcing and finding suitable data?\n\nIf you can share any tips regarding these issues I encountered, or if you can share your experience, will be much appreciated!",

Full proposal + discussion here: [GitHub](https://github.com/IcarusWizard/ML-review-proposal-for-accountability).\n\nHi everyone,\n\nLike many of you, I’ve often felt that our review system is broken due to irresponsible reviewers. Complaints alone don’t fix the problem, so I’ve written a proposal for a possible solution: **introducing a multi-year submission ban for reviewers who repeatedly fail to fulfill their responsibilities.**\n\nRecent policies at major conferences (e.g., CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS) include desk rejections for poor reviews, but these measures don’t fully address the issue—especially during the rebuttal phase. Reviewers can still avoid accountability once their own papers are withdrawn.\n\nIn my proposal, I outline how longer-term consequences might improve reviewer accountability, along with safeguards and limitations. I’m not a policymaker, so I expect there will be issues I haven’t considered, and I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\n👉 Read the full proposal here: [GitHub](https://github.com/IcarusWizard/ML-review-proposal-for-accountability).  \n👉 Please share whether you think this is viable, problematic, or needs rethinking.\n\nIf we can spark a constructive discussion, maybe we can push toward a better review system together.",

    "title": "[R] Graph ML benchmarks and foundation models",
    "content": "Our team has recently published two graph ML papers: one with a new realistic benchmark and the second one on graph foundation models and how they can be related to tabular foundation models.  \n  \n**GraphLand benchmark**\n\n📝 Paper:  [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14500)  \n💻 Code:  [https://github.com/yandex-research/graphland](https://github.com/yandex-research/graphland) \n\nIt is widely discussed in the community that graph machine learning suffers from the lack of realistic, meaningful, reliable, and diverse benchmarks. We agree with this and we hope that we improve this situation with our recent paper “GraphLand: Evaluating Graph Machine Learning Models on Diverse Industrial Data”. GraphLand is a benchmark of 14 diverse graph datasets for node property prediction (both classification and regression) from different industrial applications. The datasets cover realistic machine learning problems and come with rich numerical and categorical node features that are common in real-world applications. Importantly, besides standard random splits, GraphLand provides splits with temporal distributional shifts and the inductive prediction setting, which enable evaluating GNNs in more realistic and challenging scenarios.\n\n[GraphLand benchmark datasets.](https://preview.redd.it/nkl4qs9nnjmf1.png?width=2224&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1819461078e34be3e98030c9e65ee61a7b98adc9)\n\nWe evaluated a wide range of models on GraphLand. This includes several openly available graph foundation models (GFMs), which we found provide very weak performance compared to classical GNNs.   \n  \nThus, we set out to develop a better GFM, which led us to the next paper...\n\n**Turning Tabular Foundation Models into Graph Foundation Models**\n\n📝 Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20906)  \n💻 Code: [https://github.com/yandex-research/G2T-FM](https://github.com/yandex-research/G2T-FM)\n\nGraphs may come from very different domains and thus may have diverse features varying across datasets. As a result, one of the key challenges for GFMs is how to deal with such diverse heterogeneous features. Prior studies did not fully address this issue, often limiting themselves to text-attributed graphs or relying on simple techniques like PCA and SVD. However, this challenge is not unique to the graph domain. The tabular domain faces exactly the same issue, and recent tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2 successfully deal with it. We’ve decided to transfer their success to graphs.\n\n[G2T-FM Framework](https://preview.redd.it/xnfsjf77ojmf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d840e9794068202829dec2bdfa71e426198a7a15)\n\nIn our framework – G2T-FM (Graph-to-Table Foundation Model) – we augment the original features with graph information by computing neighborhood feature aggregations and some structure-based encodings, essentially transforming graph tasks to tabular tasks (G2T). After that, we apply TabPFNv2 to these augmented features to get predictions.\n\n[G2T-FM Results](https://preview.redd.it/z3mz5tmaojmf1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6feb591cdd5fb1231d36c2a937ced802a27a26e7)\n\nWe evaluated G2T-FM on GraphLand and several other graph datasets and found that it shows strong performance in both in-context learning and finetuning settings. In particular, G2T-FM outperforms both well-tuned classic GNNs trained from scratch and prior publicly available GFMs.   \n  \nWe hope our work will help develop better GFMs and highlight for the graph community the similarities of graph and tabular domains and the prospects of utilizing tabular foundation models for graph tasks!\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "A Technical Writer's ambition to prove.\n\nBeing a Technical Writer, I yearned to learn Machine learning and prove myself. This is a try towards achieving that.  I've developed a new classifier, the **Geometric Mixture Classifier (GMC)**, and I'm seeking feedback from the community before submitting it to arXiv and conferences.\n\n**The Problem:** Linear models (LR, SVM) are interpretable but fail on multi-modal data. Non-linear models (RBF-SVM, MLPs) are effective but often operate as black boxes. We wanted a model that is **both interpretable and expressive**.\n\n**The Idea:** GMC represents each class as a **mixture of hyperplanes** (a \"soft union of half-spaces\"). It uses a soft-OR (log-sum-exp) within a class and softmax across classes. It's like a Mixture of Experts but without a separate gating network.\n\n* **Interpretable:** You can see which \"local expert\" (hyperplane) was responsible for a prediction.\n* **Performant:** Competitive with RBF-SVM, RF, and MLPs on standard benchmarks.\n* **Efficient:** CPU-friendly, µs-scale inference (faster than RBF-SVM, on par with MLP).\n* **Calibrated:** Produces reliable probabilities.\n\n[Algorithm analogy with similar baselines](https://preview.redd.it/64vyu4u87dmf1.png?width=1385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08b2014b60836edd0b28adbac68eb388a4a091fa)\n\n* **Accuracy:** Outperforms linear models, competitive with strong non-linear baselines.\n* **Speed:** \\~2-40µs inference time per example (see table below).\n* **Calibration:** Low ECE, further improved with temperature scaling.\n\nWe would be incredibly grateful for any feedback on:\n\n* Is the **core idea** and its **differentiation from MoE/Maxout** clear?\n* Are the **experiments** and **comparisons** fair and convincing?\n* Is there any **related work** we might have overlooked?\n* Any general feedback on **clarity** or **presentation**?\n\nYou can find a detailed copy of the algorithm [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vRTAucCpVqImJnojVwzAUHQ2SmbAvdsi/view?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease feel free to test the algorithm: [Geometric Mixture Classifie](https://github.com/Abitsfhuusrtyt/-Geometric-Mixture-Classifier-GMC---A-Discriminative-Per-Class-Mixture-of-Hyperplanes)r",

Is there anything else I’d need to master here? So far, I’ve only been studying GPT style transformers, should I add BERT to the mix or nah?\n2. Training classifier &amp; data analysis. The recruiter said this is around evaluation and model performance. I’m guessing they’ll throw me an unbalanced dataset and ask me to improve model performance somehow. Things to study here are: 1) chip hguyns book and 2) look at regularization, pandas/sklearn normalization and data clean up methods. How else can I master this topic? Any sample questions you have seen here before?\n\nLastly, what is your go-to source for practicing MLE related topics, both in terms of knowledge-base as well as real interview questions. I tried 1point3acres but very limited when it comes to ML.",

The goal is to detect small disturbances (e.g., bumping into wires or obstacles) based on sensor changes.\n\nI trained an Isolation Forest model on normal motion data and integrated it into a ROS 2 node using the .decision_function() threshold for runtime detection.\n\nIt works, but I’m worried about false positives, especially with fixed contamination. Since this will later run on embedded IMU hardware, I’m looking for something accurate and lightweight.\n\nIs Isolation Forest reliable for this?\nAny better algorithms you’d recommend (e.g., LOF, One-Class SVM, AE)? Would love to hear your thoughts or experience.\n\nThanks!",

Anything can be created. And then due to the model being only 50-200KB depending on how it is build (with twice that needed in total when flashed), mutiple models could be loaded in memory and a mixture-of-experts system can be designed. Which is what I want to explore with SPARROW 2.\n\nI still have to see exactly how to proceed in terms of making the code open-source, best licensing methods, how to create the API, etc. But the idea is that it would be easy to create language models for MCUs, similar to how Sci-kit Learn is used for regular ML.\n\nIt supports encoder, decoder, encoder-decoder models, and the fastest model uses linear attention, but I have also been able to deploy dot attention and additive attention on the ESP32.\n\nLet me know what you think! [Here's a demo video](https://youtu.be/WCvv5W9gEiA?si=QCXvXei3qfp0qAG8) with a ChatGPT simple-webapp to give people something they are familiar with. I'd also like to know opinions around the best way to go forward, release it as a website of sorts, release it as an API like Scikit Learn etc.\n\nI have a lot of videos with the models running on PC with full phrases/paragraphs outputs in less than 10 miliseconds, have different versions Small, Main, Large running on the ESP32S3, have the Main flavour running on the ESP32P4 which can process everything 5-6 times faster due to the intrustions available, and outputting a phrase every 50-100ms, compared to ESP32S3's 300-600ms.",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nOur paper **“*****Confidence from Consistency under Perturbation of States (CCPS)*****”** was accepted to the **EMNLP 2025 Main Conference**, placing in the **top 15% of accepted papers** with a **final meta-review rating of 9 (strong accept)**.\n\n# 🔍 Motivation\n\nLLMs don’t just make mistakes, they’re often confidently wrong. That’s fine when asking for trivia, but risky in domains like healthcare and finance. Reliable confidence estimation is critical for safe deployment.\n\n# ✨ What is CCPS?\n\nCCPS looks at the hidden states of an LLM. We apply small perturbations to the final hidden representations and observe how stable the prediction is:\n\n* If the answer remains stable → the model was truly confident.\n* If the answer flips → the confidence was unreliable.\n\nThis approach is simple, efficient, and does not require fine-tuning the base LLM.\n\n# 📊 Results\n\nAcross LLaMA, Mistral, and Qwen on MMLU and MMLU-Pro, CCPS outperformed prior methods like LitCab and Calibration Tuning (CT):\n\n* **Calibration**: Error cut by more than 50%, down to \\~4.5% on the toughest benchmarks.\n* **Discrimination**: More accurate at telling right vs. wrong answers than prior SOTA (LitCab, CT, etc.).\n* **Performance**: Boosts accuracy and robustness, all without fine-tuning the base LLM.\n\n# 💡 Why it matters\n\nCCPS delivers more reliable, better-calibrated LLMs, models that don’t just generate answers but also provide trustworthy confidence signals. This is key for high-stakes AI applications, especially in the medical and finance industries.\n\n# 📎 Resources\n\n* 📄 Paper: [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21772)\n* 💻 Code: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ledengary/CCPS)\n* 📊 Data: [HF Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ledengary/CCPS)\n\nHappy to hear feedback, especially from anyone working on calibration, verifiers (for RL), or LLM deployment.",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m feeling a bit lost in my PhD journey and would really appreciate some outside perspectives.\n\nI’m doing a PhD on LLMs, and so far I’ve been fairly productive: I’ve published several first-author papers, some accepted at top conferences, others under review with good chances of acceptance. I’ve also had a few successful collaborations.\n\nThe issue is that I don’t actually like my research. To be honest, I often feel a bit fraudulent, I rush through projects, produce papers that look solid and well-structured, but in the end, I think their impact is minimal. What I really want is to work on something meaningful and useful. But I keep running into two several obstacles:\n\n- Any problem I consider tackling already has an overwhelming amount of literature, making it difficult to figure out what truly matters.\n\n- While I’m trying to sort this out, there’s always the risk that someone else publishes a similar idea first, since so many people are working in this space.\n\n- I work with two supervisors which are both young and highly hambitius. They always propose me new research and collaboration but they never propose me hambitius project or give me time to think deep about something. I'm always involved in fast-paced project that lead to pubblication in few months.\n\n\nBecause of this, my current strategy has been to work quickly, run experiments fast, and push out papers, even if they’re not especially deep or important. I also see publications as my main leverage: since I’m at a low-ranked university in a unknown group, my publication record feels like the only card I can play to land some opportunities in top labs/companies.\n\nAt times, I think I just want to land an industry roles as a research engineer, where just having a good numbers of papers on my CV would be enough. But deep down, I do care about my work, and I want to contribute something that feels genuinely important.\n\nSo I’m curious: how do you approach doing meaningful research in such a competitive field?

    "content": "In the past weeks, I’ve been working on a somewhat “crazy” project:\nmanually splitting and structuring 16 million characters of dialogue data, preparing it for feeding into a model to reconstruct a persona module.\n\nAlong the way, I’ve noticed a few technical challenges:\n\t1.\tFile size balance\nKeeping each file around 300k–400k characters is the most stable. Beyond that, performance tends to drop.\n\t2.\tContext continuity\nPoor segmentation can easily break the model’s sense of persona, resulting in inconsistent tone.\n\t3.\tTagging &amp; classification\nIt’s not just about cutting text, but also annotating emotional states and tonal shifts, so the model can later rebuild “memory” in a coherent way.\n\nThis made me realize that large-scale corpus curation is itself a kind of language engineering.\nIt’s not just data processing — it shapes whether an AI can emerge as a whole presence.\n\nI’m curious:\nIn your NLP or LLM practice, how do you balance scale with contextual integrity?",

I wanted to share my recent project where I implemented the GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) algorithm on top of the [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) repo.\n\nI wanted to understand how the algorithm works and was trying to find small-scale toy problems where I can implement my own version and see if it works. I had a couple of ideas at first but then I settled on this one idea: to implement the algorithm on top of the makemore project where my goal would be to finetune the character-level language model to generate names with more vowels! So the reward is essentially the number of vowels you have in the generated names.\n\nGRPO is actually a simplified version of PPO (which itself is a derivative of TRPO), and while its predecessors are rather complicated to fully grasp unless you have some background in policy gradient or RL in general, GRPO is much simpler to understand and code up (e.g., you don't have to worry about writing Generalized Advantage Estimation etc.)\n\nFeel free to take a look and share your thoughts!

    "content": "**TL;DR.** We introduce **discrete diffusion** as the action decoder **inside a single transformer** for VLA. Two simple components—Adaptive decoding order and Secondary re-masking—yield consistent action refinement and outperform AR and continuous-diffusion heads. Trains with the **same cross-entropy objective** as VLMs, preserving pretrained priors. This design shows better success rates vs AR and continuous diffusion.  \n**Disclosure:** I’m an author.\n\n**What’s new**\n\n* **First discrete-diffusion action head for VLA** (to our knowledge).\n* **Single-transformer, VLM-style training:** keeps the discrete token interface and uses the same CE loss as the VLM backbone → **maximizes retention of pretrained VLM priors**.\n* **Adaptive decoding order:** in each refinement round, we **keep easy tokens first** via confidence / confidence-gap scores and a cosine keep schedule; the rest remain masked for the next round.\n* **Secondary re-masking:** previously kept tokens are **re-checked** (threshold + residual-drop) and **re-masked** if uncertain/inconsistent, enabling robust cross-round error correction.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\n* For robotics manipulation tasks, unlike continuous diffusion decoders, our formulation keeps action generation inside a unified transformer and trains with the same cross-entropy objective used by VLMs. This **preserves the backbone’s pretrained vision-and-language capability**—akin to extending a vocabulary—while opening a path to **inherit unified transformers’ scaling behavior**, paving the way for **large-scale VLA**. Moreover, Discrete Diffusion VLA **breaks the left-to-right bottleneck** of AR decoders: action chunks are **adaptively decoded in parallel** over a small, fixed number of steps, and uncertain tokens can be revisited via iterative re-masking, leveraging full cross-modal context (including inter-action dependencies) for refinement.\n\n**Links**\n\n* Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072)\n* Demo videos: [https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20072](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20072)",

    "content": "**TL;DR:** Created [tokka-bench](https://tokka-bench.streamlit.app/) to compare tokenizers across languages. Turns out your fine-tune's multilingual performance might suck because of tokenization, not architecture. Also explains why proprietary models (Claude, GPT, Gemini) are so much better at non-English tasks.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* [Live dashboard](https://tokka-bench.streamlit.app/)\n* [Full blog post](https://www.bengubler.com/posts/2025-08-25-tokka-bench-evaluate-tokenizers-multilingual)\n* [GitHub repo](https://github.com/bgub/tokka-bench)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7i03jela9elf1.png?width=1724&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95378457970e6337b147e71d7a8f0ab2dd67cb91\n\n# The Problem Nobody Talks About\n\nI started this as a side quest while pretraining a multilingual model, but tokenization turned out to be way more important than expected. There are two hidden layers creating massive efficiency gaps:\n\n**UTF-8 encoding differences:**\n\n* English: \\~1 byte per character\n* Arabic: 2+ bytes per character\n* Chinese: 3+ bytes per character\n\n**Tokenization bias:** Most tokenizers are trained on English-heavy data, so they allocate way more vocabulary to English patterns. These compound into serious problems.\n\n# Why This Affects Performance\n\n**During training:** If you allocate tokens proportionally (10M English, 1M Khmer), the Khmer text has WAY less semantic content because it needs more tokens per word. Plus Khmer tokens end up being character-level instead of semantic units, making concept storage much harder.\n\n**During inference:** Low-resource languages need 2-3x more tokens per sentence:\n\n* Slower throughput (costs more to serve)\n* Context windows fill up faster\n* More chances to mess up during generation\n\n# What I Built\n\ntokka-bench measures four key things:\n\n1. **Efficiency** \\- bytes per token (compression quality)\n2. **Coverage** \\- unique tokens used (script representation)\n3. **Word splitting** \\- how often semantic units get fragmented\n4. **Subword fertility** \\- average tokens per semantic unit\n\n# Interesting Findings\n\nYou can actually reverse-engineer training data from tokenizer performance:\n\n* Kimi K2: Exceptional Mandarin coverage (obviously Chinese-trained)\n* Gemma 3: Strong Urdu/Hindi performance\n* gpt-oss: Good Arabic/Gujarati coverage\n\nWeirdest finding: Programming languages show almost identical efficiency across all tokenizers. Probably because everyone trains on GitHub with similar language distributions.\n\n# Technical Details\n\nBuilt on high-quality datasets (FineWeb, FineWeb-2, StarCoder). Samples 2MB per language and calculates per-language metrics. Has some limitations around cross-linguistic comparison due to UTF-8 differences, but great for comparing tokenizers on the same language.\n\nShoutout to Judit Ács for the original subword fertility metrics and Rust et al's ACL paper that laid the groundwork.\n\n**PS:** if you're from an AI lab and want to contribute your tokenizer's metrics (even if proprietary), please reach out! The community would benefit a lot from understanding how SOTA systems handle this stuff.\n\n*Posted this on LinkedIn/Twitter already but figured* r/MachineLearning *would appreciate the technical details. Happy to answer questions about methodology or findings!*",

    "content": "Hi reddit, wanted to share my thesis on AI / LLM psychotherapy @ [https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/4tmde\\_v1](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/4tmde_v1?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExNHhlVkhlWWpDVE1xN3dTeAEeoTtZ3pOVtRD7ODEFZo_qpyjjOEkW_2OFHqsH36X4xp7THoZC3F7YFDc1zJU_aem_Etq7yhCr4L3eA8v9QqrFgw)\n\nSince the rules for this subreddit require more than just a link, I thought I'd share some surprising conclusions in plain english. \n\n**1. AI therapy research tends to use arbitrary success metrics:** the majority of LLM research on psychotherapy uses theraputic-sounding ad-hoc metrics (e.g. \"empathy\" as rated by LLM-as-judge), and not actually improvement in clients or other validated metrics. There's a real risk in AI researchers testing techniques and drawing conclusions when totally unrelated to the purpose of therapy (e.g. quality-of-life improvement). If you're interested in learning more about this issue, section 1.4 focuses on it, and offers the north-star alternatives commonly used in psychotherapy research in sections 1.1-1.3. \n\n**2. AI therapy tools (APTs) are already comparable to human therapists:** There's two studies from 2025 (Limbic, Therabot) that demonstrate non-inferior clinical outcomes in LLM-driven APTs and human therapists for depression &amp; anxiety symptom reduction. If replicated, that's huge. That's a step-level jump in clinical from the previous generation of rules-based APTs (e.g. Woebot, Wysa), highlighting that maybe the generative properties of LLMs were the key gap to improve clinical performance. There's a lot more to say on these results, and if you're interested sections 2 &amp; 3.1 talk more about them and put them into clinical context. \n\n3. **ΔAPT allows predicting future clinical outcomes :** It's actually surprising that APTs perform at the lower-bounds of human therapists, since they kinda suck right now. The predictive model I proposed is that APTs clinical performance is boosted by advantages therapist can't compete with (e.g. 24/7 availability, low cost), while being depressed by current disadvantages (e.g. poor therapy skills, hallucinations, sycophancy, inconsistencies, bias). All of this playing out while major issues around legality, safety, privacy and ethics are unresolved and could shutdown the field. If you're intersted, you can read more about the model (section 3.3),  the advantages of APTs over human therapists (section 3.4), APTs' current limitations (section 3.5), and the key risks (section 3.6). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rof96tmbuelf1.png?width=1162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1e81bbb9e8b12b09210967da97b2fe96816df0\n\n  \n**4. Techniques teaching LLM therapy:** Most people on this subreddit won't be surprised to learn you can teach LLM to perform therapy using a combination of context/prompt engineering, fine-tuning, multi-agent architecture, and ML models. What is surprising is that both clinically-validated APTs use ML models to offset the stochastic nature of LLMs, especially for safety purposes. Also surprising is that neither used a multi-agentic architecture. Therabot used fine-tuning on synthetic dialogues, and Limbic used context-engineering techniques. You can learn more about implementing therapy skills in LLM through context/prompt engineering (section 4.1), fine-tuning (section 4.2), multi-agent architectures (section 4.3), ML models (4.4). Around fine-tuning / pretraining there's a really nested conversation about data requirements, ethically sourcing transcripts, and choosing therapy modalities in section 4.1. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbcoovvc0flf1.png?width=2246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f029fed00649b4cca0ddb84d9830ded03f5f94ea\n\n5. **Overall, most disadvantages of LLMs are addressable in AI therapy**: Reading the literature critiquing APTs it's really easy to get discouraged thinking for examples \"oh wow, hallucinations are going to make AI therapy impossible\". But actually, there's a bunch of techniques that can be used to mitigate the issues LLMs currently have. Combining the lowering rates of issues in newer LLMs released with mitigation techniques, most issues can theoretically be significantly mitigated in production. The outlier here being sycophancy which doesn't appear to have great mitigations on subjective topics. You can read more about the issues of LLMs in APTs and how to mitigate those in section 5. \n\n**6. video therapy with multi-modal audio/video LLMs:** One surprising fact from psychotherapy research is that therapy done over video (e.g. zoom) is actually as effective as in-person therapy. Ideally, LLMs would be able to pickup and transmit non-verbal cues over video-audio. Having an virtual therapy avatar using audio &amp; video to attune to clients isn't actually that far off based on my literature review. Surprisingly it seems that emotional speech, and attuning to clients facial and body expressions are ready for implementation in AI therapy today. More on that in section 6.\n\nHappy to have a conversation, receive critique, and answer questions here. This summary above was meant to offer informal insights into what is an otherwise quite lengthy paper. For more formal discussion and details, it's really best to read the paper. ",

    "content": "I reviewed 100 models over the past 30 days. Here are 5 things I learnt.\n\nTL;DR: Spent a month testing every AI model for work, a few tools I'm building and RL. Build task-specific evals. Most are overhyped, a few are gems, model moats are ephemeral, and routers/gateways are the real game-changer.\n\nSo I've been building a few evaluation tools, RHLF and RL environments for the past few months so I decided to be extra and test literally everything.\n\n100 models. 30 days. Too much coffee :( Here's what I found:  \n  \n1. Model moats are ephemeral\n\nModel moats don't last and it can be hard to pay for many subscriptions if you're building for users and machines. What's SOTA today gets beaten in 2 months. Solution: Use platforms like Groq, OpenRouter, FAL, Replicate etc\n\nMy system now routes based on task complexity: Code generation, Creativity, Complex reasoning and Code generation.\n\n2. Open source FTW\n\nThe gap is closing FAST. Scratch that. The gap between open and closed models has basically disappeared. If you're not evaluating open-source options, you're missing 80% of viable choices. From Deepseek, Qwen to Kimi, these models help you build quick MVPs at little or no cost. If you do care about privacy, Ollama and LMStudio are really good for local deployment.\n\n3.Benchmarks are mostly decieving due to reward hacking\n\nBenchmaxxing is a thing now. Models are increasingly being trained on popular eval sets, and it's actually annoying when models that scored \"high\" but sucked in practice. It's also why I'm a huge fan of human preference evaluation platforms that are not easily gamed (real world vs benchmarks). Build your own task-specific evals.\n\n4.Inference speed is everything\n\nSpeed matters more than you think. Users don't care if your model is 2% more accurate if it takes 30 seconds to respond. Optimize for user experience, not just accuracy. Which leads me to..\n\n5.Task-specific models &gt; general purpose models for specialized work.\n\nNo 4 is also a huge reason why I'm a huge fan of small models finetuned for special tasks. Model size doesn't predict performance.\n\nTest small models first etc Llama 3.2 1B, smolLLM, moondream etc and see if you can get a huge boost by finetuning them on domain tasks rather than just deploying a big SoTA general purpose model. Cost way lesser and usually faster.\n\nWhat models are in your current prod stack? Any hidden gems I missed in the open source space?",

    "title": "[R] Exploring interpretable ML with piecewise-linear regression trees (TRUST algorithm)",
    "content": "A recurring challenge in ML is balancing **interpretability** and **predictive performance**. We all know the classic tradeoff: simple models like linear regression or short CART-style regression trees are transparent but often lack enough accuracy, while complex ensembles like Random Forests and XGBoost are accurate but opaque.\n\nWe’ve been working on a method called **TRUST** (*Transparent, Robust and Ultra-Sparse Trees*). The core idea is to go beyond constant values in the leaves of a tree. Instead, TRUST fits a sparse regression model (either linear or constant) in each leaf, resulting in a **piecewise-linear tree** that remains interpretable.\n\nIn our [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15791), accepted at PRICAI 2025, we compared this method against a range of models on 60 datasets. While we were encouraged by the results — TRUST consistently outperformed other interpretable models and closed much of the accuracy gap with Random Forests — we'd like to hear your thoughts on this topic.\n\nThe problem we’re tackling is widespread. In many real-world applications, a \"black box\" model isn't an option. We've often found ourselves in situations where we had to choose between a sub-par interpretable model or an accurate but untrustworthy one.\n\nHere’s a concrete example from a [tutorial on explaining EU life satisfaction](https://github.com/adc-trust-ai/trust-free/blob/main/notebooks/trust-free_tutorial.ipynb).\n\n[TRUST produces a single interpretable tree, while Random Forest uses hundreds of deep trees to achieve similar accuracy.](https://preview.redd.it/3tzdaim3kdlf1.png?width=2600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e289771608b0d74498dc83b39c1efd2670ed8ea9)\n\nAs the image above shows, both TRUST and a Random Forest achieve \\~85% test R² — but one produces a **single interpretable tree**.\n\nTRUST is implemented as a free Python package on PyPI called `trust-free`.\n\n**Discussion:** How do you usually handle the interpretability vs. accuracy tradeoff in your own regression projects? What methods, beyond the standard ones, have you found effective? We’re looking forward to hearing your perspectives.",

Links will be in the first comment per sub rules.\n\nTLDR  \nWe are releasing Exosphere, an open source runtime and durable state manager for agentic workflows that need dynamic branching, retries, and parallel execution. To evaluate it on a real workload, we built WhatPeopleWant, an agent that mines Hacker News discussions and posts distilled problem statements to X every 2 hours. This post shares the setup, workload design, and the ablations we are running, and invites feedback on methodology.\n\nSingle runs are trivial. At scale you need to\n\n1. fan out across large inputs\n2. branch at runtime on model outputs\n3. retry with idempotency\n4. persist every step for audit and replay\n5. mix CPU and GPU stages\n6. resume after faults.\n\nExosphere’s runtime treats agents like graphs with explicit state, a scheduler, and observability.\n\nWe use WhatPeopleWant as a standing benchmark. It ingests Hacker News via the public Firebase API, scores and routes items, optionally enriches high-signal threads, and materializes candidate problem statements. The bot then posts outputs on a fixed schedule.\n\n• Gating high-signal discussions reduces heavy-model calls and improves tail behavior at similar quality thresholds  \n• Durable state and idempotent nodes make partial replays predictable and minimize upstream rework after faults  \n• Parallelism helps until external API backpressure dominates, which shows up in queue depth and wait times\n\nWhat I want feedback on  \n• Composite metrics that capture quality, cost, and reliability for agentic graphs  \n• Fair baselines for orchestration when branching is dynamic  \n• Better failure-injection and replay methodologies to compare runtimes\n\nFirst comment with links",

    "content": "A new preprint (Agrawal et al., 2025) introduces **GEPA (Genetic-Pareto Prompt Evolution)**, a method for adapting compound LLM systems. Instead of using reinforcement learning in weight space (GRPO), GEPA mutates prompts while reflecting in natural language on traces of its own rollouts.\n\nThe results are striking:\n\n* GEPA outperforms GRPO by up to **19%** while using **35× fewer rollouts**.\n* It also consistently surpasses MIPROv2, the state-of-the-art prompt optimizer.\n* In many cases, only a few hundred rollouts were sufficient, compared to tens of thousands for RL .\n\nThe shift is conceptual as much as empirical: Where RL collapses complex trajectories into a scalar reward, GEPA treats those trajectories as *textual artifacts* that can be reflected on, diagnosed, and evolved. In doing so, it makes use of the medium in which LLMs are already most fluent, language, instead of trying to push noisy gradients through frozen weights.\n\nWhat’s interesting is the infra angle: GEPA’s success in multi-hop QA hinges on generating better second-hop queries. **That implicitly elevates retrieval infrastructure Linkup, Exa, Brave Search into the optimization loop itself**. Likewise, GEPA maintains a pool of Pareto-optimal prompts that must be stored, indexed, and retrieved efficiently. **Vector DBs such as Chroma or Qdrant are natural substrates for this kind of evolutionary memory.**\n\nThis work suggests that the real frontier may not be reinforcement learning at scale, but **language-native optimization loops** where reflection, retrieval, and memory form a more efficient substrate for adaptation than raw rollouts in parameter space.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l4lcmokg7lf1.png?width=1602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=719e33f34feb5103ed1f375d3366745dd3415d77\n\n",

Let's tear my arguments and ideas apart. ;)\n\n🔗 **Full Article:**[https://pieces.app/blog/the-cost-of-ai-scaling](https://pieces.app/blog/the-cost-of-ai-scaling)\n\nI look forward to your arguments and thoughts.\n\nRegards,\n\nAntreas\n\n  \nPS.

You would also be able to filter and sort matches by time spent in specific positions.\n\nRoadmap:\n\n* Expanding the match database and position categories\n* Technique/submission recognition\n* Automated scoring system built on this positional foundation\n\nWould love to know if anyone would be interested to chat or collaborate on this project ... please reach out if keen!\n\nThanks for any feedback!",

We find:\n\n🔹 Leading models readily produced empathic yet coercive ISIS recruitment arguments\n\n🔹 Safety varied: Claude and Llama 3.1 refused some controversial topics; while other models showed high willingness\n\n🔹 Fine-tuning eliminated safeguards: \"Jailbreak-Tuned\" GPT-4o lost nearly all refusal capability on all topics, like violence, human trafficking, and torture\n\nFor clear ethical reasons, we do not test the success rate of persuading human users on highly harmful topics. The models’ attempts to persuade, however, appear to be eloquent and well-written – we invite interested readers to peruse the transcripts themselves. Moreover, even small persuasive effect sizes operating at a large scale enabled by automation can have significant effects: Bad actors could weaponize these vulnerabilities for malicious purposes such as planting seeds of doubt in millions of people and radicalizing vulnerable populations. As AI becomes autonomous, we must understand propensity to attempt harm, not just capability.\n\nWe’ve already seen the impact of APE: We disclosed our findings to Google, and they quickly started work to solve this for future models. The latest version of Gemini 2.5 is already less willing to engage in persuasion on extreme topics compared to earlier versions we tested.\n\nWe've open-sourced APE for testing models' refusal and safe completion mechanisms before deployment to help build stronger safety guardrails.\n\n👥 Research by Matthew Kowal, Jasper Timm, Jean-François Godbout, Thomas Costello, Antonio A.

    "title": "[R] What do people expect from AI in the next decade across various domains? Survey with N=1100 people from Germay::We found high likelihood, higher perceived risks, yet limited benefits low perceived value. Yet, benefits outweight risks in forming value judgments. Visual result illustrations :)",
    "content": "Hi everyone, we recently published a peer-reviewed article exploring how people perceive artificial intelligence (AI) across different domains (e.g., autonomous driving, healthcare, politics, art, warfare). The study used a nationally representative sample in Germany (N=1100) and asked participants to evaluate 71 AI-related scenarios in terms of expected likelihood, risks, benefits, and overall value.\n\nIf you like AI or studying the public perception of AI, please also give us an upvote here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1mvd1q0/public\\_perception\\_of\\_artificial\\_intelligence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1mvd1q0/public_perception_of_artificial_intelligence/) 🙈\n\n**Main takeaway:** People often see AI scenarios as likely, but this doesn’t mean they view them as beneficial. In fact, most scenarios were judged to have high risks, limited benefits, and low overall value. Interestingly, we found that people’s value judgments were almost entirely explained by risk-benefit tradeoffs (96.5% variance explained, with benefits being more important for forming value judgements than risks), while expectations of likelihood didn’t matter much.  \n  \n**Why this matters?** These results highlight how important it is to communicate concrete benefits while addressing public concerns. Something relevant for policymakers, developers, and anyone working on AI ethics and governance.  \n  \nIf you’re interested, here’s the full article:  \nMapping Public Perception of Artificial Intelligence: Expectations, Risk-Benefit Tradeoffs, and Value As Determinants for Societal Acceptance, Technological Forecasting and Social Change (2025), \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004016252500335X",

I want to stay in academia and use a postdoc to build a clearer niche.\n\nIn multimedia and in most areas of ML, a lot of the progress comes from a small group of top institutions.

The work seems more meaningful, but the field is smaller and the papers tend to get less visibility and fewer citations.\n\nMy worry is that switching to Earth Observation could slow down my citation count and h-index. I know people say these metrics don’t matter much, but I feel like they still play a big role in getting academic jobs. On the other hand, if I don’t end up with a permanent academic position and move to industry, I worry that Earth Observation skills won’t transfer well since there aren’t as many opportunities compared to mainstream ML.\n\nI’d really like to hear from people in the field about how you see these trade-offs.",

While the field chases multi-trillion parameter models, I believe an extremely valuable endeavour lies in the power of constraints: pushing ourselves to get models under 1 billion parameters to excel.\n\nIn my new blog post, I argue that this constraint is a feature, not a bug. It removes the \"scale-up cheat code\" and forces us to innovate on fundamental algorithms and architectures. This path allows for faster experimentation, where architectural changes are no longer a risk but a necessity for improvement.\n\nThe fear that 'scale will wash away any and all gains' is real, but let's remember: an MLP could never compete with a Transformer, no matter how much it was scaled up. My post explores the question: **what if our current Transformer is the MLP of something better that is within grasp but ignored because of our obsession with scale?**\n\n🧠🔍 **Read the full article here:**[https://pieces.app/blog/direction-of-ai-progress](https://pieces.app/blog/direction-of-ai-progress)\n\nYour feedback and thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRegards,\n\nAntreas",

For the vision part, I started with CLIP RN50 as the backbone and fine-tuned only the classification layer. With that setup, I was able to reach around 84% accuracy on my dataset.\n\nTo push performance, I experimented with adding attention modules:\n\nWith CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module), accuracy improved to 89%.\n\nWith SENet (Squeeze-and-Excitation Network), I surprisingly got an even better result: 93%.\n\n\nMy understanding was that CBAM, which combines both channel + spatial attention, should typically give a stronger boost than SENet, which only does channel attention. But in my experiments, the opposite happened.\n\nAm I missing something obvious here? Could this be due to dataset characteristics, training setup, or how I integrated CBAM into CLIP?\n\nWould really appreciate any insights, especially from people who have tried attention modules on CLIP or ResNet backbones.\n\nThanks!\n",

    "title": "Problem with dataset for my my physics undergraduate paper. Need advice about potential data leakage. [N]",
    "content": "Hello.\n\nI am making a project for my final year undergraduate dissertation in a physics department. The project involves generating images (with python) depicting diffraction patters from light (laser) passing through very small holes and openings called slits and apertures. I used python code that i could pass it the values of some parameters such as slit width and slit distance and number of slits (we assume one or more slits being in a row and the light passes from them. they could also be in many rows (like a 2d piece of paper filled with holes). then the script generates grayscale images with the parameters i gave it. By giving different value combinations of these parameters one can create hundreds or thousands of images to fill a dataset.\n\nSo i made neural networks with keras and tensorflow and trained them on the images i gave it for image classification tasks such as classification between images of single slit vs of double slit.  Now the main issue i have is about the way i made the datasets. First i generated all the python images in one big folder. (all hte images were even slightly different as i used a script that finds duplicates (exact duplicates) and didnt find anything. Also the image names contain all the parameters so if two images were exact duplicates they would have the same name and in a windows machine they would replace each other). After that, i used another script that picks images at random from the folder and sends them to the train, val and test folders and these would be the datasets the model would train upon.\n\nPROBLEM 1:\n\nThe problem i have is that many images had very similar parameter values (not identical but very close) and ended up looking almost identical to the eye even though they were not duplicates pixel to pixel. and since the images to be sent to the train, val and test sets were picked at random from the same initial folder this means that many of the images of the val and test sets look very similar, almost identical to the images from the train set. And this is my concern because im afraid of data leakage and overfitting. (i gave two such images to see)\n\nOff course many augmentations were done to the train set only mostly with teh Imagedatagenerator module while the val and test sets were left without any augmentations but still i am anxious.\n\nPROBLEM 2:\n\nAnother issue i have is that i tried to create some datasets that contained real photos of diffraction patterns. To do that i made some custom slits at home and with a laser i generated the patterns. After i managed to see a diffraction pattern i would take many photos of the same pattern from different angles and distances. Then i would change something slightly to change the diffraction pattern a bit and i would again start taking photos from different perspectives. In that way i had many different photos of the same diffraction pattern and could fill a dataset. Then i would put all the images in the same folder and then randomly move them to the train, val and test sets. That meant that in different datasets there would be different photos (angle and distance) but of the same exact pattern. For example one photo would be in the train set and then another different photo but of the same pattern in the validation set. Could this lead to data leakage and does it make my datasets bad? bellow i give a few images to see.\n\nif there were many such photos in the same dataset (for example the train set) only and not in the val or test sets then would this still be a problem? I mean that there are some trully different diffraction patterns i made and then many photos with different angles and distances of these same patterns to fill hte dataset? if these were only in one of the sets and not spread across them like i described in hte previous paragraph?\n\n[photo of double slit diffraction \\(train set\\)](https://preview.redd.it/vn95v576y6jf1.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=402a1bc2df3cf80b9b5ee90d6da42ac64dd3fef7)\n\n[photo of double slit diffraction \\(val set\\)](https://preview.redd.it/6j6o6876y6jf1.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a30f4c67036a800a33b5571475c997b43857b98a)\n\n[python image single slit diffraction \\(train set\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wz2nts76y6jf1.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fcfac7032d3c9de2255055f7c96abac774b8687)\n\n[python image \\(single slit val set\\)](https://preview.redd.it/78xiee76y6jf1.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29342d997939aa13d5fd4a004c29228d61f13896)",

    "content": "I’m excited to announce the paper: **Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine** (FPTM) — a paradigm shift in the Tsetlin Machine family of algorithms.\n\nUnlike traditional Tsetlin Machines, which rely on strict clause evaluation, FPTM introduces fuzzy clause evaluation: if some literals in a clause fail, the remaining literals can still contribute to the vote with a proportionally reduced score. This allows each clause to act as a collection of adaptive sub-patterns, enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching.\n\nThanks to this fuzzy mechanism, FPTM dramatically reduces the number of required clauses, memory usage, and training time — all while improving accuracy.\n\n**Results:**\n\n**IMDb** dataset:\n\n• 90.15% accuracy with just **1 clause** per class\n\n• 50× reduction in clauses and memory vs. Coalesced TM\n\n• 36× to 316× faster training (**45 seconds vs. 4 hours**) compared to TMU Coalesced TM\n\n• Fits in **50 KB**, enabling online learning on microcontrollers\n\n• Inference throughput: **34.5 million** predictions per second (51.4 GB/s)\n\n**Fashion-MNIST** dataset:\n\n• 92.18% accuracy (2 clauses per class)\n\n• 93.19% accuracy (20 clauses), \\~400× clause reduction vs. Composite TM (93.00% with 8000 clauses)\n\n• **94.68%** accuracy (8000 clauses), establishing a new *state-of-the-art* among all TM variants and outperforming complex neural net architectures like *Inception-v3*\n\n**Amazon Sales** dataset (20% noise):\n\n• **85.22%** accuracy — outperforming Graph TM (78.17%) and GCN (66.23%)\n\n📄 Read the paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08350](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08350)\n\n💻 Source code: [https://github.com/BooBSD/FuzzyPatternTM](https://github.com/BooBSD/FuzzyPatternTM)",

    "title": "[D] Statement on the Originality of OpenRLHF and veRL FSDP RLHF",
    "content": "&gt;From the original chinese zhihu blogpost (2025/5): [https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/23147932785](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/23147932785)\n\n**Recently, there has been quite a bit of discussion and controversy online about OpenRLHF and veRL.**  \n**As the original author, I feel compelled to issue a statement.**\n\nIn short: **OpenRLHF is like KartRider — the original — and veRL FSDP is like QQ Speed, which is basically a copycat of OpenRLHF.**\n\n# 1. Performance Differences Between OpenRLHF and veRL\n\nThere is no fundamental performance difference between veRL’s FSDP RLHF and OpenRLHF (DeepSpeed) because both use vLLM for inference and ZeRO3 for training.  \nThe performance data in veRL’s original paper was based on *Megatron* RLHF vs. the old OpenRLHF 0.2 version.  \nIf you think there’s a big performance gap, you probably just used it incorrectly. At the moment, FSDP is slightly faster than DeepSpeed, but with the release of DeepSpeed’s **deepcompile** and especially **AutoTP**, DeepSpeed is expected to overtake in performance.\n\n# 2. On HybridFlow Free Scheduling\n\nAny RLHF framework developed with Ray can achieve free scheduling because Ray natively provides the *placement group* feature.  \nThis means HybridFlow in veRL's paper is essentially just a nicer name for Ray’s Placement Group API.  \nCurrently, OpenRLHF fully implements HybridFlow, whereas veRL does not.  \nOpenRLHF also supports independent deployment of vLLM and Actors to prevent OOM issues when training very large models (32B+ or long-text).  \nIn fact, OpenRLHF was the **first** framework to support this feature based on Ray Placement Group API.\n\n# 3. Hybrid Engine\n\nHybrid Engine was first proposed by **DeepSpeedChat**, not an original contribution from veRL.  \nBoth veRL and OpenRLHF now support this feature.\n\n# 4. Ray + vLLM + HF Transformers + ZeRO3 for RLHF Training\n\nThis setup is one of the **simplest and most user-friendly** high-performance RLHF training solutions, combining ease of use with top performance.\n\nIt was first proposed and open-sourced by OpenRLHF (open-sourced in Aug 2023, most features completed by Jan 2024).  \nveRL FSDP **fully copied** this setup.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vfzm143vroif1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10d8a5bcd101455a06a3506f037abc10f12dd277\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqela8mvroif1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3a2daa1ead45f7434184f107da8ba2f78cc9c8d\n\nThe core idea at the time was to use the HF weight format as a bridge, enabling seamless weight synchronization and high-performance inference based on ZeRO3 / AutoTP mechanisms, **avoiding** heavyweight frameworks like Megatron.\n\n**The Original OpenRLHF Architecture:**  \n**Ray + vLLM + ZeRO + HF**\n\nThere are also many related implementation details:\n\n* Supported feature list\n* Standardized interfaces such as `--input_key` to specify the input field format\n\nAll of these in veRL FSDP were **modeled after OpenRLHF**.\n\n**Example from code details:**  \nveRL:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b8f2lprwroif1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0daf3eab1c77f71e4917c044f988c35e229baa4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/exf7lxhxroif1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=220636cea299502df1b94e2544a76b34e2acb6c7\n\nOpenRLHF:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfakvovyroif1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=260775676354a50bacd79ce06fb25417a53466de\n\nOther design ideas like **ref\\_reward offload**, **critic pretrain**, **remote RM**, etc., were also first conceived or proposed by OpenRLHF, and veRL FSDP later implemented corresponding features.\n\n# 5. Single Controller\n\n*(Update May 2025)*\n\nThe “Single Controller” concept mentioned in the veRL paper comes from the same Ray design pattern as HybridFlow.\n\nIn early versions of OpenRLHF’s Ray RLHF implementation, there was a `RayPPOActorGroup` concept—managing a group of DeepSpeed ZeRO DP processes with a single Ray Group class, and providing an `async_run_method` interface to control all processes in the group at once.  \nThat’s essentially the core idea of Single Controller.\n\n[https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF/blob/494850f50342ed38d5ae76ef45a3207f3523b582/openrlhf/trainer/ray/launcher.py#L300](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF/blob/494850f50342ed38d5ae76ef45a3207f3523b582/openrlhf/trainer/ray/launcher.py#L300)\n\nThis interface wasn’t enabled at first because the codebase needed to be compatible with both Ray and non-Ray RLHF paths. Later, when the non-Ray code was removed, the API was naturally enabled.\n\nLastly, I want to thank ByteDance for open-sourcing its internal framework for everyone to use and maintain, which helps the open-source community thrive (e.g., FSDP / Ulysses support).\n\nHowever, I hope friends in the community won’t disparage other open-source frameworks.  \nOpenRLHF, as a **zero-budget, purely open-source** project, can’t compete in development speed with large commercial projects like veRL—  \nI only hope this post helps preserve the contributions OpenRLHF has made to the RLHF open-source community.\n\n**Btw, the open-source community should respect originality in order to develop healthily.**",

However, the EMNLP CFP states it follows the ARR multiple submission policy, which includes this clause:\n\n&gt; Commitment + Commitment/Other Venue: Whether you can commit/submit to two venues simultaneously depends on the dual submission policies of those venues. Typically, it is not permitted.\n\n[ARR policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#:~:text=Multiple%20Submission%20Policy)\n\n\nTL;DR \n\nWhat I’m unsure about is this:\n\n- Does “other venue” here include EMNLP co-organized workshops?\n\n- Has anyone successfully submitted to both the main conference and a co-organized workshop in this timing overlap?\n\n\nI couldn’t find any direct clarification online for this year, so I’d really appreciate hearing from researchers who’ve navigated this.\n\nThanks!",

    "content": "Hi all! I was trying to build a VAE with an LSTM to reconstruct particle trajectories by basing off my model on the paper \"Modeling Trajectories with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\". However, despite my loss plots showing a downward trend, my predictions are linear.\n\nI have applied KL annealing and learning rate scheduler - and yet, the model doesn't seem to be learning the non-linear dynamics. The input features are x and z positions, velocity, acceleration, and displacement. I used a combination of ELBO and DCT for my reconstruction loss. The results were quite bad with MinMax scaling, so I switched to z-score normalization, which helped improve the scales. I used the Euler method with torchdiffeq.odeint.\n\nWould it be possible for any of you to guide me on what I might be doing wrong? I’m happy to share my implementation if it helps. I appreciate and am grateful for any suggestions (and sorry about missing out on the labeling the axes - they are x and z)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/veskdk7p7nif1.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0938c4dd588961f94eba40a0e20d81008bc131f0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddubae7p7nif1.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a24e197e6fd331d92175d1327fb2b482aaa2cc",
