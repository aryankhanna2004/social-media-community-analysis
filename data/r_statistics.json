    "title": "[Q] The impact of sample size variability on p-values",
    "content": "How big of an effect has sample size variability on p-values? Not sample-size itself, but its variability? This keeps bothering me, but let me lead with an example to explain what I have in mind.\n\nLet's say I'm doing a clinical trial having to do with leg amputations. Power calculation says I need to recruit 100 people. I start recruiting but of course it's not as easy as posting a survey on MTurk: I get patients when I get them. After a few months I'm at 99 when a bus accident occurs and a few promising patients propose to join the study at once. Who am I to refuse extra data points? So I have 108 patients and I stop recruitment.\n\nNow, due to rejections, one of them choking on an olive and another leaving for Tailand with their lover, I lose a few before the end of the experiment. When the dust settles I have 96 data points. I would have prefered more, but it's not too far from my initial requirements. I push on, make measurements, perform statistical analysis using NHST (say, a t-test with n=96) and get the holy p-value of 0.043 or something. No multiple testign or anything, I knew exactly what I wanted to test and I tested it (let's keep things simple).\n\nNow the problem: we tend to say that this p-value is the probability of observing data as extreme or more than what I observed in my study, but that's missing a few elements, namely all the assumptions that are baked into sampling and the tests etc. In particular, since the t-test assumes a fixed sample size (as required for the calculation), my p-value is \"the probability of observing data as extreme or more than what I observed in my study assuming n=97 assuming the NH is true\".\n\nIf someone wanted to reproduce my study however, even using the exact same recruitment rules, measurement techniques and statistical analysis, it is not guaranted that they'd have exactly 97 patients. So the p-value corresponding to \"the probability of observing data as extreme or more than what I observed in my study following the same methodology\" would be different from the one I computed which assumes n=97. The \"real\" p-value, the one that corresponds to actually reproducing the experiment as a whole, would probably be quite different from the one I computed following common practices as it should include the uncertainty on the sample size: differences in sample size obviously impact what result is observed, so the variability of the sample size should impact the probability of observing such result or more extreme.\n\nSo I guess my question is: how big of an effect would that be? I'm not really sure how to approach the problem of actually computing the more general p-value. Does it even make sense to worry about this different kind of p-value? It's clear that nobody seems to care about it, but is that because of tradition or because we truly don't care about the more general interpretation? I think that this generalized interpretation of \"if we were to redo the experiment we'd be that much likely to observe at least as extreme data\" is closer to intuition than the restricted form we compute in practice but maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWhat do you think?",

    "content": "As one part of my masters thesis, I'm attempting to model tree failure probability (binary- Unlikely/Elevated) vs. tree-level and site-level predictors; 3 separate models, one for each species. Unfortunately 3 stats classes in the past 2 years did not go into much depth on this topic. I originally had a 4-category response variable, but reduced to 2 due to low power/ # obs in some categories. So I originally started with ordinal CLMs/CLMMs (ordinal package) and ordinal BRMs (Bayesian regression models, brms package), but switched to GLMMs (glmmTMB) after moving to binary outcomes. As an example, here are 3 versions of the Douglas-fir model:\n\n    m_fail_PSME &lt;- clmm(\n      Fail.like ~ Built.Unbuilt + z_logDBH + z_CR + z_Mean_BAI_10 +\n        z_BA.m2.ha + z_SM_site + z_vpdmax + z_Architectural_sum + z_Physical_sum + \n        z_Biological_sum + (1 | Site),\n      data = psme_data, link = \"logit\", Hess = TRUE, na.action = na.omit)\n    b_ord_psme &lt;- brm(\n      Fail.like ~ Built.Unbuilt + z_logDBH + z_CR + z_Mean_BAI_10 +\n        z_BA.m2.ha + z_SM_site + z_vpdmax +\n        z_Architectural_sum + z_Physical_sum + z_Biological_sum + (1 | Site), data   = psme_data,  \n       family = cumulative(link = \"logit\"), chains = 4, iter = 2000, cores = 4, seed   = 2025)\n    m_risk_PSME &lt;- glmmTMB(\n      Fail.bin ~ Built.Unbuilt + z_logDBH + z_CR + z_logMean_BAI_10 +\n        z_BA.m2.ha + z_SM_site + z_vpdmax +\n        z_Architectural_sum + z_Physical_sum + z_Biological_sum + (1 | Site),\n      data   = psme_data, family = binomial(), REML   = FALSE)\n\nI've done linear mixed effects models to answer my other research questions and have a pretty solid understanding of how to find the \"best\" model with LMEs, but not with binomial GLMMs. Is the model selection process similar (e.g., drop 1, refit, check significance, check AIC, etc.)? Must you use DHARMa simulated residuals for diagnostics?\n\nAlso, what are the best tests/plots for reporting final results with this type of model?\n\nThanks",

    "content": "A while ago I asked in this subreddit about interpretable methods for time-series classification and was suggested to look into functional data analysis (FDA).  I've spent the past week looking into it and am still extremely confused about what advantages FDA has over other methods particularly when it comes to problems that can be modeled as being generated by some physical process.\n\nFor example, suppose I have some time-series data generated a combination of 100 sine functions. If I didn't know this in advance (which is the point of FDA), had limited, sparse, and noisy observations, and wanted to apply an FDA method to the problem, as far as I can tell, this is what I would do:\n\n1. Assume that the data is generated by some basis (fourier/b-splines/wavelets)\n2. Solve a system of equations to find out the coefficient of the basis functions\n\nThen, depending on my task:\n\n3. Apply functional PCA to figure out which one of those basis functions really affects the data.\n4. Using domain knowledge, interpret the principal components\n\nor \n\n3. Apply functional regression to answer questions like 'how does a patient's heart rate over a 24-hour period influence their blood pressure?'\n4. Use functional regression model to do....something that's better than what can be done with traditional methods\n\nOR\n\nsomething else that can supposedly be done better than traditional methods\n\n\nWhat I'm not understanding is why we'd use functional data analysis anywhere at all. The hard part (FPCA interpretation) is still left up to the domain expert and I believe it's just as hard as interpreting, for example, a deep learning model that performs equally well on the data. I also have some qualms about arbitrarily applying wavelets/fourier functions/splines as basis functions, rather arbitrarily. I know the point is that your generating process is smooth, but I'm still kind of unconvinced by why this is a better method at all. Could someone give me insight on the problem?",

For example, we might receive a lot of 500 parts, select 30 samples from the lot, and measure a few dimensions on each sample. The dimensions that are measured are based on what are the most key characteristics to functionality. \n\n\n\n**For this component**: It is an instruction booklet with artwork/text inside. These are long and include several different languages, so we want to develop a method/sampling rationale to only inspect a few pages to make sure color, graphics, bleed-through, etc. all match the requirements. No page or requirement aspect is more key than the others. \n\n\n\n**Question**: How are samples of a sample usually incorporated into sampling plans?

Inspecting just 30 pages from 1 booklet or 5 pages across 6 booklets doesnt seem right, but all 250 pages from 30 booklets is also unreasonable.

I'm using a python stats models SARIMAX model with some AR/MA terms but nothing beyond that, hoping that the inclusion of daily weather and some month/season indicators builds in most seasonal effects.\n\nI'm seeing a consistent pattern in my in sample residuals where peak load times (winter days in this instance) have a lot higher/more variable residuals than during base load times. I've tried engineering some different interaction terms/nonlinear weather effects without much change.\n\nI think the crux of the issue is that my model is fitting too much to the non-winter days, causing it to suffer accuracy in the peak load times. The stats models SARIMAX implementation seems to use MLE. I'm trying to find the most painless solution between modifying the objective function/weighting the data so that my model can be more accurate in capturing peaks. \n\nIf you have suggestions for other libraries/models (e.g I've considered WLS but haven't found much in the literature of it being used for this task) please let me know as well! \n\n\nThanks!",

The latter is more valuable not just because of its generalizability to wider fields, but just due to the fact that it is quantitavely more rigorous and complete, with emphasis on proofs and really understanding and showing how methods work. It is higher on the academic hierarchy basically.\n\nAlso another thing is I'm an international student who would need visa sponsorship after graduation. Methodological/thoeretical stats is strongly in the STEM field and shortage list for occupations while applied stats is usually not (it is in the social science category usually). \n\nI am asking specifically for academia by the way, I imagine applied stats does much better in industry.",

I feel like I don’t have enough groups to create a robust model using a traditional training/testing data 70/30 split. So what I’ve done is I disaggregated the data so that it’s at the member level (there are ~82k members), then I simulated 10,000 groups of random sizes (the sizes follow an exponential distribution to approximate my actual group size distribution), then I randomly sampled the members into the groups with replacement, finally I aggregate the data up to the group level to get a training data set.\n\nWhat concerns me: the model is trained and tested on effectively the same underlying membership - potentially causing training bias.\n\nWhy I think this works: none of the simulated groups are specifically the same as my real groups. The underlying membership is essentially a pool of people that could reasonably reflect any new employer group we insure.

    "title": "[Question] Can someone help me understand the difference between these two ANOVAs? (\"species by treatment\" vs \"treatment by species\")",
    "content": "Hello everyone. I am a graduate student researcher. For my master's I gave a bunch of different wetland plants three different amounts of polluted water -- no pollution (0%), 30%, and 70%. Now I am doing statistics on those results (in this case, the amount of metal within the plants' tissues).\n\nThe thing is, I am bad at statistics and my brain is very confused. A statistician has been kind of tutoring me and I've been learning but its been slow going. \n\nSo here's the thing I don't understand-- I've used Jump to do ANOVAs comparing both my five plant species, and the three treatment groups. Here's a picture of the Tukey tables from those: [https://ibb.co/FLKFzYTh](https://ibb.co/FLKFzYTh)\n\nWhat is exactly the difference between \"treatment by species\" and \"species by treatment?\" He had me transform the data logarithmically because the \"Residual by Predicted Plot\" made a cone shape which apparently is \"bad.\" Then he had me do ANOVAs with \"treatment by species\" and \"species by treatment.\" The thing is I don't actually understand the difference between those two things... I asked my tutor today at the end of our meeting and he explained but I just was nodding with a blank stare because I knew we were out of time. This stuff is like black magic to me, any help would be very appreciated! \n\nSo in short, my tutor had me do an ANOVA in Jump where the \"Y\" was Log(Al-L) (that stands for \"Aluminum in Leaves\" data) of \"Treatment by Species\" and then \"Species by Treatment\" and I don't actually know why he had me do any of those things or what the difference between those two groups is.

This talk uses concrete COVID-19 and vaccine-safety case studies to highlight foundational pitfalls: base-rate fallacy, Simpson’s paradox, post-hoc/time confounding, mismatched risk windows, differential follow-up, and biases driven by surveillance and health-care utilization.  \n  \nIllustrative examples include:  \n\n\n1. Why a high share of hospitalized patients can be vaccinated even when vaccines remain highly effective.\n2. Why higher crude death rates in some vaccinated cohorts do not imply vaccines cause deaths.\n3. How policy shifts confound before/after claims (e.g., zero-COVID contexts such as Singapore), and how Hong Kong’s age-structured coverage can serve as a counterfactual lens to catch a glimpse of what might have occurred worldwide in 2021 if not for COVID-19 vaccines.\n4. How misaligned case/control periods (e.g., a series of nine studies by RFK appointee David Geier) can manufacture spurious associations between vaccination and chronic disease.\n5. How a pregnancy RCT’s “birth-defect” table was misread by ACIP when event timing was ignored.\n6. Why apparent vaccine–cancer links can arise from screening patterns rather than biology.\n7. What an unpublished “unvaccinated vs. vaccinated” cohort (“An Inconvenient Study”) reveals about non-comparability, truncated follow-up, and encounter-rate imbalances, despite being portrayed as a landmark study of vaccines and chronic disease risk in a recent congressional hearing.\n\nI will outline a design-first, transparency-focused workflow for critical scientific evaluation, including careful confounder control, sensitivity analyses, and synthesis of the *full* literature rather than cherry-picked subsets, paired with plain-language strategies for communicating uncertainty and robustness to policymakers, media, and the public. I argue for greater engagement of statistical scientists and epidemiologists in high-stakes scientific communication.",

    "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nNeed some help as AI tools are giving different answers. REALLY appreciate any replies here, in depth or surface level. This involves risk of ruin, expected playthrough before ruin and expected loss overall.\n\nI am going to be playing on a video poker machine for a $2-$3k value bonus. I need to wager $18,500 to unlock the bonus.\n\nI am going to be playing 8/5 Jacks or Better poker (house edge of 2.8%), with $5 per hand, 3 hands dealt per hand for $15 per hand wager. The standard deviation is 4.40 units, and the correlation between hands is assumed at 0.10.\n\nMy scenario I am trying to ruin is I set a max stop loss of $600. When I hit the $600 stop loss, I switch over to the video blackjack offered, $5 per hand, terrible house edge of 4.6% but much low variance to accomplish the rest of the playthrough.\n\nI am trying to determine what is the probability that I achieve the following before hitting the $600 stop loss in Jacks or Better 8/5:\n$5000+ playthrough \n$10,000+ playthrough\n$15,000+ playthrough\n$18,500, 100% playthrough?\n\nWhat is the expected loss for the combined scenario of $600 max stop loss in video poker, with continuing until $18,500 playthrough in the video poker? What is the probability of winning $1+, losing $500+, losing $1000+, losing $1500+ for this scenario.\n\nI expect average loss to be around $1000. If I played the video poker for the full amount, I’d lose on average $550. However the variance is extreme and you’d have a 10%+ of losing $2000+. If I did blackjack entirely I’d lose ~$900 but no chance of winning.\n\nAppreciate any mathematical geniuses that can help here!",

    "title": "[Discussion] What I learned from tracking every sports bet for 3 years: A statistical deep dive",
    "content": "I’ve been keeping detailed records of my sports betting activity for the past three years and wanted to share some statistical analysis that I think this community might appreciate. The dataset includes over 2,000 individual bets along with corresponding odds, outcomes, and various contextual factors.  \n  \nThe dataset spans from January 2022 to December 2024 and includes 2,047 bets. The breakdown by sport is NFL at 34 percent, NBA at 31 percent, MLB at 28 percent, and Other at 7 percent. Bet types include moneylines (45 percent), spreads (35 percent), and totals (20 percent). The average bet size was $127, ranging from $25 to $500. Here are the main research questions I focused on: Are sports betting markets efficient? Do streaks or patterns emerge beyond random variation? How accurate are implied probabilities from betting odds? Can we detect measurable biases in the market?  \n  \nFor data collection, I recorded every bet with its timestamp, odds, stake, and outcome. I also tracked contextual information like weather conditions, injury reports, and rest days. Bet sizing was consistent using the Kelly Criterion. I primarily used Bet105, which offers consistent minus 105 juice, helping reduce the vig across the dataset. Several statistical tests were applied. To examine market efficiency, I ran chi-square goodness of fit tests comparing implied probabilities to actual win rates. A runs test was used to examine randomness in win and loss sequences. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test evaluated odds distribution, and I used logistic regression to identify significant predictive factors.  \n  \nFor market efficiency, I found that bets with 60 percent implied probability won 62.3 percent of the time, those with 55 percent implied probability won 56.8 percent, and bets around 50 percent won 49.1 percent. A chi-square test returned a value of 23.7 with a p-value less than 0.001, indicating statistically significant deviation from perfect efficiency. Regarding streaks, the longest winning streak was 14 bets and the longest losing streak was 11 bets. A runs test showed 987 observed runs versus an expected 1,024, with a Z-score of minus 1.65 and a p-value of 0.099. This suggests no statistically significant evidence of non-randomness.  \n  \nLooking at odds distribution, most of my bets were centered around the 50 to 60 percent implied probability range. The K-S test yielded a D value of 0.087 with a p-value of 0.023, indicating a non-uniform distribution and selective betting behavior on my part. Logistic regression showed that implied probability was the most significant predictor of outcomes, with a coefficient of 2.34 and p-value less than 0.001. Other statistically significant factors included being the home team and having a rest advantage. Weather and public betting percentages showed no significant predictive power.  \n  \nAs for market biases, home teams covered the spread 52.8 percent of the time, slightly above the expected 50 percent. A binomial test returned a p-value of 0.034, suggesting a mild home bias. Favorites won 58.7 percent of moneyline bets despite having an average implied win rate of 61.2 percent. This 2.5 percent discrepancy suggests favorites are slightly overvalued. No bias was detected in totals, as overs hit 49.1 percent of the time with a p-value of 0.67. I also explored seasonal patterns. Monthly win rates varied significantly, with September showing the highest win rate at 61.2 percent, likely due to early NFL season inefficiencies. March dropped to 45.3 percent, possibly due to high-variance March Madness bets. July posted 58.7 percent, suggesting potential inefficiencies in MLB markets. An ANOVA test returned F value of 2.34 and a p-value of 0.012, indicating statistically significant monthly variation.  \n  \nFor platform performance, I compared results from Bet105 to other sportsbooks. Out of 2,047 bets, 1,247 were placed on Bet105. The win rate there was 56.8 percent compared to 54.1 percent at other books. The difference of 2.7 percent was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.023. This may be due to reduced juice, better line availability, and consistent execution. Overall profitability was tested using a Z-test. I recorded 1,134 wins out of 2,047 bets, a win rate of 55.4 percent. The expected number of wins by chance was around 1,024. The Z-score was 4.87 with a p-value less than 0.001, showing a statistically significant edge. Confidence intervals for my win rate were 53.2 to 57.6 percent at the 95 percent level, and 52.7 to 58.1 percent at the 99 percent level. There are, of course, limitations. Selection bias is present since I only placed bets when I perceived an edge. Survivorship bias may also play a role, since I continued betting after early success. Although 2,000 bets is a decent sample, it still may not capture the full market cycle. The three-year period is also relatively short in the context of long-term statistical analysis. These findings suggest sports betting markets align more with semi-strong form efficiency. Public information is largely priced in, but behavioral inefficiencies and informational asymmetries do leave exploitable gaps. Home team bias and favorite overvaluation appear to stem from consistent psychological tendencies among bettors. These results support studies like Klaassen and Magnus (2001) that found similar inefficiencies in tennis betting markets.  \n  \nFrom a practical standpoint, these insights have helped validate my use of the Kelly Criterion for bet sizing, build factor-based betting models, and time bets based on seasonal trends. I am happy to share anonymized data and the R or Python code used in this analysis for academic or collaborative purposes. Future work includes expanding the dataset to 5,000 or more bets, building and evaluating machine learning models, comparing efficiency across sports, and analyzing real-time market movements.  \n  \nTLDR: After analyzing 2,047 sports bets, I found statistically significant inefficiencies, including home team bias, seasonal trends, and a measurable edge against market odds. The results suggest that sports betting markets are not perfectly efficient and contain exploitable behavioral and structural biases.",

I've used a classifier to classify them into k groups. (WLG k=2). How do I know what parts of each time series caused this classification, and why? I'm well aware that the answer is 'it depends on the classifier' and the ugly duckling theorem, but I'm also quite interested in understanding, for example, what sorts of techniques are used in finance. I'm working under the assumption that in financial analysis, given a time-series of, say, stock prices, you can explain sudden spikes in stock prices by saying 'so-and-so announced the sale of 40% stock'. But I'm not sure how that decision is made. What work can I look into?",

    "content": "From my understanding Marylin Savants explanation is as follows; When you first pick a door, there is a 1/3 chance you chose the car. Then the host (who knows where the car is) always opens a different door that has a goat and always offers you the chance to switch. Since the host will never reveal the car, his action is not random, **it is giving you information**. Therefore, your original door still has only a 1/3 chance of being right, but the entire 2/3 probability from the two unchosen doors is now concentrated onto the single remaining unopened door. So by switching, you are effectively choosing the option that held a 2/3 probability all along, which is why switching wins twice as often as staying.\n\nClearly switching increases the odds of winning. The issue I have with this reasoning is in her claim that’s the host is somehow “revealing information” and that this is what produces the 2/3 odds. That seems absurd to me. The host is constrained to always present a goat, therefore his actions are uninformative. \n\nConsider a simpler version: suppose you were allowed to pick two doors from the start, and if either contains the car, you win. Everyone would agree that’s a 2/3 chance of winning. Now compare this to the standard Monty Hall game: you first pick one door (1/3), then the host unexpectedly allows you to switch. If you switch, you are effectively choosing the other two doors. So of course the odds become 2/3, but **not because the host gave new information**. The odds increase simply because you are now selecting two doors instead of one, just in two steps/instances instead of one as shown in the simpler version. \n\nThe only way the hosts action could be informative is **if** he presented you with car upon it being your first pick. In that case, if you were presented with a goat, you would know that you had not picked the car and had definitively picked a goat, and by switching you would have a 100% chance of winning.\n\n\nC.! → (G → G)\n\nG. → (C! → G)\n\nG. → (G → C!)\n\nLooking at this simply, the hosts actions are irrelevant as he is constrained to present a goat regardless of your first choice. The 2/3 odds are simply a matter of choosing two rather than one, regardless of how or why you selected those two. \n\nIt seems Savant is hyper-fixating on the host’s behavior in a similar way to those who wrongly argue 50/50 by subtracting the first choice. Her answer (2/3) is correct, but her explanation feels overwrought and unnecessarily complicated. ",

Each stain have their own characteristics though, so I hypothesized that there will be relationship like \"if it doesn't work on m\\_i, it should work on m\\_j\". I have the record of the stains and their success rate on some methods. Unfortunately, the stain vs methods experiment are not exhaustive. Most stains are only tested on subset of **M**. One day, I came across a new kind of stain. I tested it on some methods **O** ⊆ **M** once, so I have a binary data (success/not) of size |**O**|. Now I'm curious, what would be the success rate for the other methods **U** = **M**\\\\**O** given the observation of methods in **O**? Since the observation are just binary data instead of success rate, is it still possible to do inference?\n\nAlthough the dataset samples are incomplete (each sample only have values for subset of M), I think it's at least enough to build the joint data of pairwise variables in M. However, I don't know what kind of bivariate distribution I can fit to the joint data. \n\nIn Gaussian models, to do this kind of conditional inference, we have a closed formula that only involves the observation, marginals, and the joint multivariate gaussian distribution of the data. In this case however, since we are working with success rate, the variables are bounded in \\[0,1\\], so it can't be gaussian, I'm thinking that it should be Beta?? What kind of transformation for these data do you think is ok so that we can fit gaussian? what are the possible losses when we do such transformation?\n\nIf we proceed with non-gaussian model, what kind of joint distribution that we can use such that it's possible to calculate the posterior given that we only have the pairwise joint distribution?  \n",

    "content": "Here is an example of the problem I want to solve: a server with 4 CPUs is running 8 processes waiting for IOs 66% of the time.\n\nI am convinced that using a binomial law is the solution. But I haven't done any statistics for years, so I can't be 100% sure. Here are the details of my solution.\n\nSo, 8 processes using CPU 33% (1-66%) of the time: `Binomial(n = 8, p = 1/3)`. Then, I'm looking for:\n\n        P(X &gt; 4)\n        = 1 - P(X &lt;= 4)\n        = 1 - P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4)\n\nIn a spreadsheet, I use the formula `=1-BINOMDIST(4, 8, 1/3, TRUE)` which returns 0.0879. So for \\~9% of the time, there is a CPU contention. First question, is it correct?\n\nAdding more processes improves throughput but degrades latency because of CPU contention. So I want to know of how the % of slowdown. I feel like it's 9% slower, since processes are waiting for a CPU 9% of their time. But when I compute with more than 32 processes the CPU contention is ceiling at 100%. It's obvious since a probability of more than 100% is a non sens. Either, this percentage is not an indicator of the latency increase, or it does not work above 100%.\n\n|Processes|CPU contention|\n|:-|:-|\n|8|9%|\n|16|68%|\n|24|95%|\n|32|99%|\n|33|100%|\n|64|100%|\n\nMy last idea is to weight by the number of waiting processes, still with the same example of 4 CPUs and 8 processes: \n\n    P(X=5) + P(X=6) * 2 + P(X=7) * 3 + P(X=8) * 4\n    = BINOMDIST(5,8,1/3,FALSE) + BINOMDIST(6,8,1/3,FALSE)*2 + BINOMDIST(7,8,1/3,FALSE)*3 + BINOMDIST(8,8,1/3,FALSE)*4\n    = 0.1103490322\n    ~= 11%\n\nSecond question, is it correct to weight each distribution of the binomial law by the number of waiting processes to estimate the % of latency increase?",

Aren’t the 10 items on a personality scale also a kind of sample from a much broader population of possible items that could have been used to measure that construct?\n\nSo why is it acceptable to average or factor-analyze those item responses, but not acceptable to simply average competence ratings across a set of “attractive faces”?\n\nDoes anyone have any sources they could guide me to that cover this or related issues?

But what about when something is happening multiple times in succession? Such as when rolling two dice, if I were to ask what are the odds of rolling a 7 five times in a row the result would be(1/12^5 =0.00000402 or 0.000402%) \n\nBut if a 7 were to roll 4 times in a row and you were to ask someone what are the odds that I roll a 7 again? They would tell you it is 1/12 since rolling dice are supposed to be independent events. \n\nSo this is where I am having confusion. How can both be true?

    "content": "Hello I could really use someone's help with this issue. Basically, I have a HUGE dataset, and the point of the analysis is to figure out what percent of the US population is bilingual. However, I STRONGLY suspect that people who are bilingual are significantly more likely to have taken this survey based on the way the survey was advertised, thus giving me bad results.\n\nMy question is, is this study completely ruined and unfixable? Here's what I've thought of for fixing it: Starting with post-stratification weighting. However, this doesn't really fix the issue because the bias isn't caused by demographics (an 18 yo female who took the study is more likely to be bilingual than an 18 yo female in the general population). So I thought maybe I would try Bayesian Logistic Regression modeling, as this introduces priors and is supposed to be helpful with selection bias issues. However, what would I do for my priors? If my priors are the percent of each demographic that are bilingual based on past studies, isn't this begging the question?\n\nAny suggestions?",

    "content": "I'm trying to analyse some behavioural data. I have a large dataset which shows how the behaviour varies with time and the population of origin, and for a subset of that data I also have measurements of other traits that are predicted to explain the behaviour.\n\nFor the first (larger) model I included time and population as fixed effects, and I found that time significantly explained the behaviour, and that while population wasn't significant, there was a sig. interaction between time and the population of origin, which was explained by much lower readings in a single population toward the end of the observation period (as shown by a tukey post-hoc).\n\nNow I'm trying to model the additional traits that are predicted to explain the behaviour.  The other traits also vary across time and population, so I want to include the new variables as fixed effects, and time &amp; pop as random effects in order to remove that correlation. However, including population in the model causes a convergence error (because only one group is different to all the others).\n\nSo what do I do? I can't just ignore the interaction or the group driving it, but I also cannot see how to include it in my model.\n\nI'm working in R with generalised linear mixed models from lme4. Time (i.e. the month of observation) and population are encoded as factors, while the additional variables are continuous. Each measured individual was randomly sampled at only one time point. \n\nI've tried encoding the random effects variously as ... + (1|month) + (1|population), or ... +(1|month:population). Neither helped with the convergence issue.\n\nI'm aware that this is probably a stupid question and betrays a lack of basic understanding. Yeah. But any advice you can give would be appreciated :)",

    "content": "\r\nHey r/statistics\n\r\nI'm diving into some forensic accounting work and want to run a Benford's Law analysis on a set of financial statements to check for anomalies/fraud. I've got this Google Sheet with balance sheet, income statement, and maybe cash flow data: [The Google Sheet link is in the comments below.]\r\n\r\nFor those unfamiliar, Benford's Law looks at the distribution of leading digits in numerical data (expecting more 1s than 9s, etc.), but it only works well on \"naturally occurring\" numbers from transactions. So, I know I need to filter out stuff like totals, percentages, negatives, zeros, and rounded estimates to avoid skewing the results.\r\n\r\nQuick question: Based on standard practice, which specific line items or types of accounts in typical financial statements should I **remove** before running the analysis? For example:\r\n- All subtotals and grand totals (obvious, but confirm)?\r\n- Deferred revenue or accrued expenses (since they might be estimates)?\r\n- Equity sections or non-operating items?\r\n- Anything from the cash flow statement?\r\n\r\nIf you've got a checklist or tool (like in Excel/Python) for cleaning data for Benford's, share away! Also, any tips on handling multi-year data or currency conversions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance – trying to get this right for a real case.\r\n\r\n",

    "content": "Hello,\n\nSo I'm trying to build out a predictive model to forecast future ticket sales for comedy shows, trained on the comedians' historical ticket sales performance. Currently, I'm just using a linear model, with the comedians' podcast viewership by metropolitan area and a control for venue capacity as independent variables. There is a clear linear relationship between the comedian's podcast views and the comedian's ticket sales. That relationship only grows more robust when making population adjustments (e.g., views per capita).\n\nOne hurdle I keep running into is that the **ticket sales outcomes are artificially constrained by the capacity of the venue**. The modal show is a \"sell out.\" Subsequently, the model I'm developing -- while robust -- tends to be really conservative, hovering around the venue's capacity. Ideally, this model would help indicate where sales might even exceed capacity.\n\nAre there any methods appropriate for this type of analytics? One with an artificial supply constraint such as venue capacity? I've looked into the tobit model, which I think is a good place to start? But is there anything else I should poke around into to help me develop this project?\n\nI might also explore modeling out \"Percent of tickets sold\" rather than nominal ticket sales, though that has proven to be less robust in some early analyses.\n\nThanks!",

You can, in fact, use any well-approximating basis for the learned activations.\n* Shape-restricted models, i.e. modeling the probability of winning an auction given auction features x and a bid b - predict increasing B-Spline coefficients c(x) using a neural network, apply to a B-Spline basis of b.\n\n  \nI wrote ad-hoc implementations for past projects, so I decided to turn it into a library.  \nI hope some of you will find it useful!",

Whatever causal query you have, and whatever rule you apply, you're always left with some intervention after applying the rule.

    "content": "Some context: I'm working on a project and I'm looking into applying survival analysis methods to some weather data to essentially extract some statistical information from the data, particularly about clouds, like given clear skies what's the time until we experience partly cloudy skies or mostly cloudy skies (those are the three states I'm working with).\n\nThe thing is, I only have time series data (from a particular region) to work with. The best I could do up to this point was encode a column for the three sky conditions based on another cloud cover column, and then another column with the duration of that sky condition up to that point.\n\nSo my question is: Does it make sense at all to try to fit survival models such as Weibull regression or Cox regression to get information like survival probability or cumulative hazard for these sky conditions?\n\nOr, is there a better way to try analyze and get some statistical information on the duration of clear skies, [partly] cloudy skies in a time-to-event fashion (beyond something like Markov or other stochastic models)?\n\nFeel free to ask for elaboration and feel free to be scathing in the comments bc I have a feeling that trying to do survival analysis on time series data might be nonsensical!\n\nEdit: There are covariates in data, hence why I had been looking into survival regression methods.",

Therefore, I think I need to standardize each test group to its own control (use tbWT as tbMUTANT's standard), but in the final product, I would like to show only the reference (WT) alongside the test groups (i.e. WT, tbMUTANT, mdMUTANT, etc).\n\nHow would you go about this? First standardize each control dataset to the reference dataset, and then standardize each test dataset to its corresponding control dataset?\n\nThanks!",

On top of this, I have been asked that the sample represents ethnic minorities and women at least as much as the overall population, ie my final sample has &gt;=46% women.\n\nOur senior grades are regrettably over represented by white and male (though it is only a couple of percentage points off), so if I were to randomly sample in line with the grade percentages my expected minority and gender representation would be under represented (as I am taking larger proportion from the skewed white and male population).\n\nI'm sure that there are more methods, but I am considering running the sample over and over until I get one that meets the sample, or adding a weighting to the female and minority employees to make them more likely to be selected (though the latter would only improve the expected ratios, I could still sample from the tail and get an under representation).\n\nI realise that regardless I will be adding bias, and an individual white male employee will be less likely to be picked, but we are ok with that.

Android’s documentation includes the following statement about GPS accuracy:  \n  \n\"Returns the estimated horizontal accuracy radius in meters of this location at the 68th percentile confidence level. This means that there is a 68% chance that the true location of the device is within a distance of this uncertainty of the reported location. Another way of putting this is that if a circle with a radius equal to this accuracy is drawn around the reported location, there is a 68% chance that the true location falls within this circle. This accuracy value is only valid for horizontal positioning, and not vertical positioning.\"   \n  \nMy question is: **What is the best way to account for this measurement error in forensic analysis?**\n\n  \nFor context, the most common question we face is whether a phone was at a specific location during a given timeframe.\n\nWhen I search the internet it suggests using the Rayleigh distribution to calculate the standard deviation and from there use MCMC with two normal distribution, one for lat another for lon to generate a posterior distribution of the phone’s likelihood of being at the specified location.

My research interest is in the application of computational modeling and statistical methods to epidemiology. Through googling I’ve found several top schools doing this type of research - Carnegie, etc - but I understand my current background limits any chance I have of acceptance to those programs.\n\n\nIs my only real pathway to these types of programs a masters degree? 6 years removed from academia, it seems so. My current weak points for a PhD application are a weak undergrad GPA (which feels like ages ago…), zero research, and the concern that all my letters of recommendation would be professional, not academic. A masters would\n\n1. Provide me a refresh of mathematics and prime the pump for higher level statistics (I took calc I-III, linear algebra, prob&amp;stats, regression analysis, programming, and more back in undergrad - but 6 years is a long time)\n\n2. Give me an opportunity to increase my GPA for a more competitive application\n\n3. Open the door for research opportunities\n\n4. Offer networking opportunities for research and letters of recommendation\n\n5. Would be easier to back out of and return to industry, should I need to\n\n\nOf course, the downside of the masters is the cost and time commitment. Unfortunately my company cannot guarantee me any funding at this time. My question is:\n\n1. Do you all agree a masters is the best possible step?\n\n2. Do there exist any programs or advice you’d have for a transition from industry to PhD?\n\n3. Is there any chance I could simply get into a PhD program as-is? Certainly not a top program, but anything?\n\n Thank you in advance.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: I have considered that my salary will be cut to 1/3 of what it is now in a PhD program. My partner (who has already completed a PhD and is working full time in industry now) and I are on board with the lifestyle adjustments it would take. I also have built up a decent nest egg for retirement and savings that makes the income cut easier to swallow. Just want to point out that I’m not going in blind here in this regard.\n\n\n",

Surprisingly, there is quite little information online about the analytical side of A/Bs. \n\nI want to understand how were the formulas created, what is the role of specific values in the formulas and so on. For example, I am using the evanmiller.org calculator. In the sample size calculator section, I do not really understand what are \"baseline conversion rate\", \"absolute\" and \"relative\" points. \n\nI've read that A/B tests are just rebranded T-tests. Is that true? By definition they do seem identical. Can I therefore dive deeper into T-tests to understand the formulas and apply that knowledge to A/B? I guess I'll find more info about T-tests, as they are a long established statistical concept. ",

    "content": "Hi all, \n\nJust wondering if the amount of mathematics I've done at uni is sufficient for masters/PhD studies in the UK or Australia (open to other countries as well though these 2 are most convenient, not the US though). FYI I'm currently an honours student in Stats in New Zealand, here are the maths/mathematical statistics papers i've taken:\n\nFrom the maths dept i've done 2 courses on linear algebra and calculus - covered basic vector &amp; matrix operations, eigenvalues/vectors, vector spaces, sequences, series, single and multivariable calculus, optimisation and differential equations, among others.   \n  \nFor stats/probability theory I've done 2 courses in probability, 1 in financial mathematics and doing 1 in stochastic processes rn. I also plan to take a course in statistical inference/mathematics next semester. Unfortunately my university has cut a lot of statistical/probability theory courses recently. I've also done applied courses in bayesian inference, regression modelling, data science, etc.\n\nProbability courses covered sigma-algebra, L\\^p spaces, modes of convergence, generating functions and some stochastic models, distributions, among others.\n\nDo you think this background would be considered sufficient for graduate-level study overseas? Or would I likely need more (e.g. real analysis)? One worry atm is that some courses lacked rigour imo, only done 1 proof-heavy course atp. I'd be open to auditing or taking additional maths papers after my honours year.\n\nWould appreciate any advice, thanks!",

I figured y'all deserved it!\n\nThose who said that there was some miscommunication or error in defining the null or alternative hypotheses were **correct**. That was the ticket.\n\nI went through all of your comments (which, frankly, got a little overwhelming!), visited with a tutor, had my professor re-explain, did more digging through the lab manual, and was still getting confused... but I must have been in a good headspace this evening because 2 words in the lab manual FINALLY clicked in my brain. *Expected* and *observed*. They're in the chi-squared table, but I wasn't fully grasping things. I was first comprehending the definition of H0 as \"Your results are due to chance alone,\" but it's ACTUALLY \"T*he difference between your expected and observed results* are due to chance alone.\" These are 100% opposite ideas. At least, as the lab manual tells it.\n\nLIGHTBULB.\n\nI should have been looking more closely at the lab manual, but we don't reference it as often, so I (wrongly) assumed it would not be a helpful resource. So that's a lesson for me.\n\nI want to thank everybody for their thoughtfulness and contributions. It's really cool how passionate y'all are, and how dedicated you are to accuracy. I know it got a bit divisive in there. But I really appreciate the time people spent trying to support me in my learning. My brain is now mush and I have dedicated more hours this week to this dang concept than my actual homework. But I wanted to truly understand this. And you helped. So, again, thank you.\n\n**ADDENDUM:**  \nSo, I have been told that I am still not getting this concept. I should note that this is for a genetics class, not a stats class. The thing I feel I DO have some authority to speak on is that, as a biology major, I've observed 100- and 200-level biology tends to dip a towel into other disciplines, wring out the towel, and then collect some of the drippings and re-present them. For example, when we first start learning about The Powerhouse Of The Cell(TM), textbooks say that energy is stored in chemical bonds, and when you break those bonds, energy is released. A chemistry professor told me this was absolute bunk as a general rule; if I recall, bonds are broken in this particular reaction, but energy is made by those resulting molecules making *new* bonds - so energy is being made as the bonds are broken, *technically*, but only because the broken bonds allow new bonds to form. Or something like that. If you are becoming an LPN and need a shortcut to understanding that adenosine triphosphate releases energy somehow, \"bonds are broken and energy is released\" will get you where you need to go. It ain't 100% chemistry. It's quasi-chemistry. Likewise, I think my genetics class is using quasi-statistics. It's not totally accurate, but it's what the lab manual says, and what my professor says, and I just gotta go with the flow for now.",

    "content": "I’ve been struggling with this concept (all statistics concepts, honestly). Here’s an explanation I tried creating for myself on what this actually means:\n\nOk, so a confidence level is constructed using the sample mean and a margin of error. This comes from one singular sample mean. If we repeatedly took samples and built 95% confidence intervals from each sample, we are confident about 95% of those intervals will contain the true population mean. About 5% of them might not. We might use 95% because it provides more precision, though since its a smaller interval than, say, 99%, theres an increased chance that this 95% confidence interval from any given sample could miss the true mean. So, even if we construct a 95% confidence interval from one sample and it doesn’t include the true population mean (or the mean we are testing for), that doesn’t mean other samples wouldn’t produce intervals that do include it.\n\nAm i on the right track or am I way off?

Now, expected value is applied to a random variable, so \"X | Y = y\" must somehow be a random variable, which I'll denote by Z.\n\nBut a random variable is a function from the sample space of an experiment to the real numbers. So what's the experiment and the outcome space for Z?\n\nMy best guess is that the experiment for Z, which I'll denote by E', is as follows: perform experiment E. If Y = y, then the value of Z is the defined as the value of X. If Y is not y, then experiment E' failed, and there is no output for Z; try again. The outcome space for E' is defined as Y\\^(-1)(y).\n\nIs all of this correct? Am I wrong to say that just because we write down E\\[X | Y=y\\], it means there is a hidden random variable \"X | Y=y\"? Should I just think of E\\[X | Y=y\\] in terms of its formal definition as sum x\\*P(x|Y=y), and not try to relate it to the other definition of expected value, which is applied to a random variable?",

    "content": "Hello. I am working with a highly censored environmental dataset (&gt;70%) (left-censored). I subset it into different categories borne out of the combination of two variables (Site x Contaminant), so my dataset turned into several smaller datasets with varying degrees of censoring (ranging from 0 to 100) and different circumstances such as the highest value being a censored one, censored values being equal in number (say, 0.1 as concentration) as the non-censored values, amongst others that made it impossible to find an approach that would fit all of my smaller datasets. Therefore, I used a mixed approach of KM and MLE, and even then some datasets were constructed in such a way that I could not find an approach that would model them confidently.\n\nI don't have a background in statistics, and I have to present my results soon (this analysis is only the first step of a broader analysis), so my question is:  how defensible is what I did? I know both KM and MLE are reputable methods to handle censored datasets, but I cannot find a paper or report where they have both been used.\n\nThank you.\n\n  \nEDIT: If I was an idiot by doing so, I would greatly appreciate knowing it before presenting these results to my professor, lol.",

I can not insert that idea inside my mind.\n\nWhat I can understand is that the degrees of freedom are the set of values that can \"vary freely\" once you fix a couple values. When you have a set of data and you want to set a line, you have 2 points to be fixed -and those two points gives you the slope and y-intercept-, and then if you have more than 2 then you can estimate the error (of course this is just for a simple linear regression)\n\nBut what about the SSR? Why \"k\" variables can vary freely? Like, if the definition of SSR is sum((estimated(y) - mean(y))²) why would you be able to vary things that are fixed?

In my opinion to make this application work they would have to have people select restaurants based on a quality value (rating of 5 attributed to the restaurant), wait time (ex how long a customer will wait for food in minutes), cost (average price per person), etc but just a restaurant name leaves us with nothing but frequency of selection for mathematical manipulation. \n\nMy professor deducted points with the comment that the rule of 5’s states that there is a 93.75 chance that the actual mean will fall within the low and high outcome of any random sample of 5. \n\nI don’t think that feedback makes any sense.

Why won’t this approach work? \n\nA: The “rule of 5” is intended to get a general idea of a population’s opinion on a single characteristic. It’s not designed to compare different distinct choices.

    "content": "TL;DR - Is there any way to make a formula to calculate win probability in a one-on-one bowling match, with no historical data?\n\nHi all! Collegiate bowler here, in the recent season, the PBA (Prof. Bowlers Association) switched over to CBS for broadcasting. On the new channel, I noticed a new stat that appeared periodically during the match: Win Probability. I was extremely curious where they were getting the data for this; the PBA notoriously does not have an archive, at least a digital one, and this change only came with the swap from FOX to CBS. It’s very likely that they’re pulling numbers out of their… backside.\n\nBut it made me wonder if it was even possible? I know for baseball and football, Win Probability is usually calculated by comparing the current state of the game to historical precedents, but there’s probably not a way to do that for bowling. The easiest numbers at our disposal would be the bowlers’ averages throughout the tournament before matchplay began, first ball percentage as well as strike percentage. \n\nI’m not experienced in making up new statistical formulas wholecloth, is there any way to make a formula that would update after each shot/frame to show a bowler’s chance of winning the game? Or at the very least, can anyone point me in a direction to better figure out how to make one? Any help would be appreciated!",

State of the art algorithms like Walker's alias method can do O(1) selection, but require an O(N) setup and is not suitable for evolving populations.

    "title": "Is the R score fundamentally flawed? [Question]",
    "content": "Is the R score fundamentally flawed?\n\nI have recently been doing some research on the R-score. To summarize, the R-score is a tool used in Quebec CEGEPS to assess a student's performance. It does this using a kind of modified Z-score. Essentially, it takes the Z-score of a student in his class (using the grades in that class), multiplies it by a dispersion factor (calculated using the grades of a class from High School) and adds it to a strength factor (also calculated using the grades of a class from High School). If you're curious I'll add extra details below, but otherwise they're less relevant.\n\nMy concern is the use of Z-scores in a class setting. Z-scores  seem like a useful tool to assess how far a data point is, but the issue with using it for grades is that grades have a limited interval. 100% is the best anyone can get, yet it isn't clearly shown in a Z-score. 100% can yield a Z-score of 1, or maybe 2.5, it depends on the group and how strict the teacher is. What makes it worse is that the R-score tries to balance out groups (using the strength factor) and so students in weaker groups must be even more above average to have similar R-scores than those in stronger groups, further amplifying the hard limit of 100%.\n\nI think another sign that the R-score is fundamentally flawed is the corrected version. Exceptionally, if getting 100% in a class does not yield an R-score above 35 (considered great, but still below average for competitive University programs like medicine), then a corrected equation is applied to the entire class that guarantees exactly 35 if a student has 100%. The fact that this is needed is a sign of the problem, especially for those who might even need more than an R-score of 35.\n\n\nI would like to know what you guys think, I don't know too much statistics and I know Z-scores on a very basic level, so I'm curious if anyone has any more information on how appropriate of an idea it is to use a Z-score on grades.\n\n\n\n(for the extra details:  The province of Quebec takes in the average grade of every High School student from their High School Ministry exams, and with all of these grades it finds the average and standard deviation. From there, every student who graduated High School is attributed a provincial Z-score. From there, the rest is simple and use the proprieties of Z-scores:\n\nIndicator of group dispersion (IGDZ): Standard deviation of every student's provincial Z-score in a group. If they're more dispersed than average, then the result will be above 1. Otherwise, it will be below 1. \n\nIndicator of group strength (IGSZ): Mean of every student's provincial Z-score in a group. If theyre stronger than average, this will be positive. Otherwise, it will be negative.\n\nR score =  (IGDZ x Z Score) + IGSZ ) x 5 + 25\n\nGeneral idea of R-score values:\n20-25: Below average\n25: Average\n25-30: Above average\n30-35: Great\n35+: Competitive\n~36: Average successful med student applicant's R-score",

    "content": "I’m a clinical/forensic psychologist with a PhD and some research experience,  and often get asked to be an ad hoc reviewer for a journal.\n\nI recently recommended rejecting an article that had a lot of problems, including small, unequal  n and a large number of dependent variables. There are two groups (n=16 and n=21), neither which is randomly selected. There are 31 dependent variables, two of which were significant. My review mentioned that the unequal, small sample sizes violated the recommendations for their use of MANOVA. I also suggested Bonferroni correction, and calculated that their “significant” results were no longer significant if applied.\n\nI thought that was the end of it. Yesterday, I received an updated version of the paper. In order to deal with the pairwise error problem, they combined many of the variables together, and argued that should address the MANOVA criticism, and reduce any Bonferroni correction. To top it off, they removed 6 of the subjects from the analysis (now n=16 and n=12), not because they are outliers, but due to an unrelated historical factor. Of course, they later  “unpacked” the combined variables, to find their original significant mean differences.\n\nI want to explain to them that removing data points and creating new variables after they know the results is absolutely not acceptable in inferential statistics, but can’t find a source that’s on point. This seems to be getting close to unethical data manipulation, but they obviously don’t think so or they wouldn’t have told me.",

I'd appreciate a sanity check on my approach and any advice you might have.\n\n**My Goal**: Quantify how much our marketing spend contributes to advertiser acquisition and overall ad revenue.\n\n**The Challenge**: I don't believe there's a direct causal link. My hypothesis is a two-stage process:\n\n* Stage 1: Marketing spend -&gt; Increases user acquisition and retention -&gt; Leads to higher Monthly Active Users (MAUs).\n* Stage 2: Higher MAUs -&gt; Makes our platform more attractive to advertisers -&gt; Leads to more advertisers and higher ad revenue.\n\nThe problem is that the variable in the middle (MAUs) is endogenous. A simple regression of Ad Revenue \\~ MAUs would be biased because unobserved factors (e.g., seasonality, product improvements, economic trends) likely influence both user activity and advertiser spend simultaneously.\n\n**Proposed IV Setup**:\n\n* **Outcome Variable** (Y): Advertiser Revenue.\n* **Endogenous Explanatory Variable** (\"Treatment\") (X): MAUs (or another user volume/engagement metric).\n* **Instrumental Variable** (Z): This is where I'm stuck. I need a variable that influences MAUs but does not directly affect advertiser revenue, which I believe should be marketing spend.\n\nMy Questions:\n\n* Is this the right way to conceptualize the problem? Is IV the correct tool for this kind of mediated relationship where the mediator (user volume) is endogenous? Is there a different tool that I could use?\n* This brings me to a more fundamental question: Does this setup require a formal \"experiment\"? Or can I apply this IV design to historical, observational time-series data to untangle these effects?\n\nThanks for any insights!\n\n",

    "title": "[Education]/[Question] Prospective Statistics Graduate Student In Canada Questions Regarding Education and Future Careers/Salary",
    "content": "Hi all!\n\nI'm planning on applying to Master's and PhD Statistics programs this year in Canada, and one of my top choices is UofT. Of course, I'm applying for all other Stats Master's/PhD programs in the country that match my interests, but I wanted to ask recent (last few years) Master's/PhD Statistics program graduates from Canada if you would be able to share some insight into the following general and specific questions? I would also welcome any advice from less recent graduates/well-established professionals. I just wanted to know the current climate for new graduates!\n\n***General Questions For Both Master's/PhD Graduates:***\n\n1. What you're doing now (work/career-wise)?\n\n2. How much do you earn/are projected to earn?\n\n3. In your opinion, was doing your post-grad in stats worthwhile? Would you have picked a different career path/post-grad degree looking back? If so, what would it be?\n\n4. Where are you living now (if you're staying in Canada or found good jobs elsewhere)? How is the statistics/stats-related job market in Canada actually, from personal experience? And\n\n5. What is the lifestyle you're able to live/afford, given your career choice and the current economic environment?\n\n***Master's Student Graduate Specific Questions:***\n\nI understand that for a Master's, there are course-based and thesis-based programs. I was wondering if people who've taken either would be able to share your job/career prospects out of the degree, how you find they differ, and what your opinions on it are? Additionally, for those who've taken a course-based master's, has that hindered you from getting a PhD if that's something you wanted/want to do? Has doing a course-based master's/ a thesis-based master's (not a PhD) prevented you from getting high-paying jobs (especially in recent times)?\n\n***PhD Student Graduate Specific Questions:***\n\n1. For PhD students, would you say it was worth it (time, money, etc...), especially if you want to work in the industry afterwards, or would a Master's have been better? Additionally, how were funding/expenses? Were you able to graduate without too much/any/manageable enough debt?\n\n2. I have also seen on other posts in the Statistics sphere that school prestige matters when considering a PhD for jobs, and most people try to go to the States because of that. I'm a little hesitant when applying there for political/funding reasons (I'll be applying as a Canadian international student, so my main concern is that they would send me back before fully completing my degree), so I wanted to hear your thoughts about that, and finding well-paying jobs (120k plus) in various stats-related fields as a Canadian graduate.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to reply to me, I appreciate any help/advice you can offer and all that you're comfortable sharing!",

    "title": "[Question] Help with understanding non-normal distribution, transformation, and interpretation for Multinomial logistic regression analysis",
    "content": "Hey everyone. I've been conducting some research and unfortunately my supervisor has been unable to assist me with this question. I am hoping that someone can provide some guidance.\n\nI am predicting membership in one of three categories (may be reduced to two). My predictor variables are all continuous. For analysis I am using multinomial logistic regression to predict membership based on these predictor variables. For one of the predictors which uses values 1-20, there is a large ceiling effect and the distribution is negatively skewed (quite a few people scored 20). Currently, with the raw values I have no significant effect, and I wonder if this is because the distribution is so skewed. In total I have around 100 participants.\n\nI was reading and saw that you can perform a log transformation on the data if you reflect the scores first. I used this formula **log10(20 (participant score + 1) - participant score)**, which seems to have helped the distribution normality a lot (although overall, the distribution does not pass the Shapiro-Wilks test \\[p =.03\\]). When I split the distributions by category group though, all of the distributions pass the Shapiro-Wilks test.\n\nAfter this transformation though, I can detect significant effects when fitting a multinomial logistic regression model, but I am not sure if I can \"trust it\". It also looks like the effect direction is backwards (I think because of the reflected log transformation?). In this case, should I interpret the direction backwards too? I started with three predictor variables, but the most parsimonious model and significant model only involves two predictor variables.\n\nI am a bit confused about the assumptions of logistic regression in general, with the difference between the assumptions of a normal overall distribution and residual distribution.\n\nLastly, is there a way to calculate power/sensitivity/sample size post-hoc for a multinomial logistic regression? I feel that my study may have been underpowered. Looking at some rules of thumb, it seems like 50 participants per predictor is acceptable? It seems like the effect I can see is between two category groups. Would moving to a binomial logistic regression have greater power?\n\nSorry for all of the questions—I am new to a lot of statistics.\n\nI'd really appreciate any advice. (edit: less dramatic).",

    "content": "Hi everyone, I'm a PhD student in Music Education and I could use some help. I'm primarily self taught in a lot of stats since music school doesn't really teach you much statistics (go figure). Unfortunately, I feel like I've reached the point where my professors in the college of music aren't able to help me much because they don't have experience in this and they would be learning it alongside me. So I find myself here asking for help.\n\nOne of the projects I'm working on is trying to model the relationship between music student enrollment decisions and school characteristics (funding, demographic composition, staffing characteristics). \n\nUsing state administrative data I have access to students schedules, academics, demographic etc. The students then being clustered in schools. \n\nMy plan has been to fit a hierarchical model. I've used fixed effects before but not random effects. I've read chapters in books and watched YouTube videos but it's just not clicking for me. My understanding is that HLM's are kind of centered around random effects because you are allowing variance within the cluster whereas fixed effects would remove that. This results in being able to model both within and between school variation. Because of this I feel as if random effects are more appropriate than fixed effects unless I were to include a fixed effect for time invariant effects (right?). \n\nSo I guess my questions come down to\n\n1) Am I understanding this correctly?  \n2) Should I use random or fixed effects?   \n3) If using random effects how can I partition the between and within school variance. Initially I thought of using a fixed effect for year only to capture between school variation and then in a subsequent model introducing a fixed effect for school to look at within school variation. Is that a possibility too? But if I go that route its not really a HLM anymore is it?  \n4) My other thought is mixed effects using a random effect for schools but fixed effect for year.",

    "content": "Hello, I'm gonna get straight to the point. Just graduated in spring 2025 with a B.S. in statistics. Getting through college was a battle in itself, and I only switched to stats late in my junior year. Because of how fast things went I wasn't able to grab an internship. My GPA isn't the best either.\n\nI've been trying to break into DA and despite academically being weak I'd say I know my way around R and python (tidyverse, matplotlib, shiny, the works) and can use SQL in conjunction with both. That said, I realize that DA is saturated so I may be very limited in opportunities.\n\nI am considering taking actuary P and FM exams in the fall to make some kind of headway, but I'm not really sure if I want to pigeonhole myself into the actuary path just yet.\n\n I was wondering if anyone has any advice as to where else I can go with a stat degree, and if there's somewhere that isn't as screwed as DA/DS right now. Not really considering a masters, immensely burnt out on school right now. To be clear, school sucked, but I don't necessarily have any disdain for the field of statistics itself. \n\nEven if it's something I can go into for the short term future, I'd just appreciate some perspectives.",

    "title": "[Discussion] Causal Inference - How is it really done?",
    "content": "I am learning Causal Inference from the book All of Statistics.\nIs it quite fascinating and I read here that is a core pillar in modern Statistics, especially in companies: If we change X, what effect we have on Y?\n\nFirst question is: how much is active the research on Causal Inference ? is it a lively topic or is it a niche sector of Statistics?\n\nSecond question: how is it really implemented in real life? When you, as statistician, want to answer a causal question, what do you do exactly?\n\nFeom what I have studied up to now, I tried to answer a simple causal question from a dataset of Incidences in the service area of my companies.\nThe question was: “Is our Preventive Maintenance procedure effective in reducing the failures in a year of our fleet of instruments?”\n\nOf course I run through ChatGPT the ideas, but while it is useful to have insightful observations, when you go really deep i to the topic it kind of feeld it is just rolling words for sake of writing (well, LLM being LLM I guess…).\n\nSo here I ask you not so much about the details (this is just an excercise Ininvented myself), I want to see more if my reasoning process is what is actually done or if I am way off.\n\nSo I tried to structure the problem as follows:\n1) first define the question: I want the PM effect across all fleet (ATE) or across a specific type of instrument more representative of the normality (e.g. medium useage, &gt;5 years, Upgraded, Customer type Tier2) \n, i.e. CATE.\n\nI decided to get the ATE as it will tell menif the PM procedure is effective across all my install base included in the study.\n\nI also had challenge to define PM=0 and PM=1. \nAt first I wanted PM=1 to be all instruments that had a PM within the dataset and I will look for the number of cases in the following 365 days.\nThen PM=0 should be at least comparable, so I selected all instruments that had a PM in their lifetime, but not in the year previous to the last 365 days. (here I assume the PM effect fades after 365 days).\n\nSo then I compare the 365 days following the PM for the PM=1 case, with the entire 2024 for the PM=0 case. The idea is to compare them in two separate 365 days windows otherwise will be impractical. Hiwever this assumes that the different windows are comparable, which is reasonable in my case.\n\nI honestly do not like this approach, so I decided to try this way:\n\nConsider PM=1 as all instruments exposed to PM regime in 2023 and 2024.\nConsider PM=0 all instruments that had issues (so they are in use) but had no PM since 2023.\n\nThis approach I like more as is more clean. Although is answering the question: is a PM done regularly effective? Instead of the question: “what is the effect of a signle PM?”. which is fine by me.\n\n2) I defined the ATE=E(Y|PM=1, Z)-E(Y|PM=0,Z), where Z is my confounder, Y is the number of cases in a year, PM is the Preventive Maintenance flag.\n\n3) I drafted the DAG according to my domain knowledge. I will need to test the implied independencies to see if my DAG is coherent with my data. If not (i.e. Useage and PM are correlated while in my DAG not), I will need to think about latent confounders or if I inadvertently adjusted for a collider when filtering instruments in the dataset.\n\n4) Then I write the python code to calculate the ATE:\nStratify by my confounder in my DAG (in my case only Customer Type (i.e. policy) is causing PM, no other covariates causes a customer to have a PM).\nThen calculate all cases in 2024 for PM=1, divide by number of cases, then do the same for for PM=0 and subtract. This is my ATE.\n\n5) curiosly, I found all models have an ATE between 0.5and 1.5.\nso PM actually increade the cases on average by one per year.\n\n6) this is where the fun begins:\nBefore drawing conclusions, I plan to answer the below questions:\ndid I miss some latent confounder?\ndid I adjusted for a collider?\nis my domain knowledge flawed? (so maybe my data are screaming at me that indeed useage IS causing PM).\nCould there be other explanations: like a PM generally results in an open incidence due to discovered issues (so will need to filter out all incidences open within 7 days of a PM, but this will bias the conclusion as it will exclude early failure caused by PM: errors, quality issues, bad luck etc…).\n\nHonestly, at first it looks very daunting.\neven a simple question like the one I had above (which by the way I already know that the effect of PM is low for certain type of instruments), seems very very complex to answer analytically from a dataset using causal inference.\nAnd mind I am using the very basics and firsts steps of causal inference. I fear what feedback mechanism, undirected graph etc… are involving.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading. Any input on real life causal inference is appreciated ",

Get Set Up\n\t•\tInstall R and RStudio (most popular IDE).\n\t•\tLearn the basics: variables, data types, vectors, data frames, and functions.\n\t•\tGreat free book: R for Data Science\n\t•\tAlso check out DataDucky.com – super beginner-friendly and interactive. \n\n⸻\n\n2. Work With Real Data\n\t•\tImport CSVs, Excel files, etc.\n\t•\tLearn data wrangling with tidyverse (especially dplyr and tidyr).\n\t•\tPractice using free datasets from Kaggle.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Visualize Your Data\n\t•\tggplot2 is a must – start with bar charts and scatter plots.\n\t•\tSeeing your data come to life makes learning way more fun.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Build Small Projects\n\t•\tAnalyze data you care about – sports, games, whatever keeps you interested.\n\t•\tShare your work to stay motivated and get feedback.\n\n⸻\n\nLearning R can feel overwhelming at first, but once you get past the basics, it’s incredibly rewarding. Stick with it, and don’t be afraid to ask questions here – this community is awesome.",

    "title": "Questions on Linear vs Nonlinear Regression Models [Discussion]",
    "content": "I understand this question has probably been asked many times on this sub, and I have gone through most of them. But they don't seem to be answering my query satisfactorily, and neither did ChatGPT (it confused me even more).\n\nI would like to build up my question based on this post (and its comments):  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/7bo2ig/linear\\_versus\\_nonlinear\\_regression\\_linear/](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/7bo2ig/linear_versus_nonlinear_regression_linear/)\n\nAs an Econ student, I was taught in Econometrics that a Linear Regression model, or a Linear Model in general, is anything that is **linear in its parameters**. Variables can be x, x^(2), ln(x), but the parameters have to be like - β, and not β^(2) or sqrt(β).\n\nBased on all this, I have the following queries:\n\n**1)** I go to Google and type nonlinear regression, I see the following images - [image link](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=b860543b1a2d43da&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeoJTKjrFjVxydQWqI2NcOhZVmrJB8DQUK5IzxA2fZbQFdefm-R5bofa1WSrxtBzW8q6xnlhbYSM4DVHaH8nJ1Z2MXDajHuHd42lTtpbv09Wfuki1HmQNbarV7HfbRjDBxYZOBPEbqoFgQRDbwPXIGUQblpwlD_2Y8b4t7V2TLncG-WpXKQ&amp;q=nonlinear+regression&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjg9aCKu8OPAxV0UvUHHaEGN-8QtKgLegQIFBAB&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=585&amp;dpr=1.5). But we were told in class (and also can be seen from the logistic regression model) that linear models need not be a straight line. That is fine, but going back to the definition, and comparing with the graphs in the link, we see they don't really match.\n\nI mean, searching for nonlinear regression gives these graphs, some of which are polynomial regression (and other examples, can't recall) too. But polynomial regression is also linear in parameters, right? Some websites say linear regression, including curved fitting lines, essentially refer to a hyperplane in the broad sense, that is, the internal link function, which is linear in parameters. Then comes **Generalized Linear Models (GLM)**, which further confused me. They all seem the same to me, but, according to GPT and some websites, they are different.\n\n**2)** Let's take the Exponential Regression Model -&gt; **y = a \\* b\\^x**. According to Google, this is a nonlinear regression, which is visible according to the definition as well, that it is nonlinear in parameter(s).\n\nBut if I take the natural log on both sides, **ln(y) = ln(a) + x ln(b)**, which further can be written as **ln(y) = c + mx**, where the constants ln(a) and ln(b) were written as some other constants. This is now a linear model, right? So can we say that some (not all) nonlinear models can be represented linearly? I understand functions like **y = ax/(b + cx)** are completely nonlienar and can't be reduced to any other form.\n\nIn the post shared, the first comment gave an example that **y = abX** is nonlinear, as the parameters interacting with each other violate Linear Regression properties, but the fact that they are constants means that we can rewrite it as **y = cx**.\n\nI understand my post is long and kind of confusing, but all these things are sort of thinning the boundary between linear and nonlinear models for me (with generalized linear models adding to the complexity). Someone please help me get these clarified, thanks!",

So far I've got 5 questions, the first 2 two are industry specific (construction) so I won't list here, but I've got two questions as shown below that I could do with feedback on.\n\nI don't really want questions with calculations in as I don't want to ask them to use a laptop, or do something in R etc, it's more about showing they know basic stats and also can they explain concepts to other (non-stats) people. Two of the questions are:\n\nWhen undertaking a multiple linear regression analysis:\n\ni) describe two checks you would perform on the data before the analysis and explain why these are important.\n\nii) describe two checks you would perform on the model outputs and explain why these are important.\n\n2) How would you explain the following statistical terms to a non-technical person (think of an intelligent 12-year old)\n\ni) The null hypothesis\n\nii) p-values\n\nAs I say, none of this is supposed to be overly difficult, it's just a test of basic knowledge, and the last question is about if they can explain stats concepts to non-stats people. Also the whole test is supposed to take about 20mins, with the first two questions I didn't list taking approx. 12mins between them. So the questions above should be answerable in about 4mins each (or two mins for each sub-part). Do people think this is enough time or not enough, or too much?\n\nThere could be better questions though so if anyone has any suggestions then feel free! :-)",

    "content": "Hey everyone! I’m about to start my senior year of undergrad and I have been advised by my department to consider graduate school. I’m seriously thinking about doing a Master’s in Statistics or Data Science. However, I would like to know just how competitive my profile is and/or what programs would suit me best. As of now, my inclination is to work in the industry rather than in academia.\n\n\n\nI’m an Applied Math major with a Statistics minor. My current GPA is 3.95 with a major GPA of 3.94 (lowest grade was a B+ in real analysis, then two A-s in Calc 2 and DiffEqs; everything else is As). My program is a mix of a lot of things, including theory of probability and stochastic processes, mathematical statistics, algorithm design and optimization, and mathematical analysis. \n\n\n\nMy GRE scores are 170Q/168V/4.5AW. I have been working as a research assistant for several months, although I don’t think I’ll have anything published by graduation. Regarding letters of recommendation, I can get one from my program’s director (who I work as an RA for) and another from a Math/Stats professor (or a CS professor I TA'd for). I also completed a year-long internship as a data analyst, so I can get a third LOR from my supervisor. If it’s relevant at all, I have received scholarships for all semesters/terms I was elegible for.\n\n\n\nIs there anything that could make my profile more complete or improve my chances? What programs should I consider with this profile? Thank you for reading. I would really appreciate your feedback/help!",

Both Loc A and Loc B have all three of these zones. Each zone per location has \\~20 rows of data - each row with a count of people at the zone and count of birds - so about 120 rows in total.\n\n\n\nI ran some ANOVAs and made a couple linear models, and noticed the count of birds was very similar between the Moderate and Low zones of a location, and this was present at both locations. These results can't speak on their own, though, since it's possible there's a huge difference in # of visitors between the Moderate and Low zones at Loc A, for example, but a minor difference in # of visitors for the same zones at Loc B. This would indicate different factors in play, I assume. I have no idea what sort of test can do this. I don't know if it's enough to compare the means of the zones at each location, as in Moderate at Loc A vs Moderate at Loc B, or if I want to combine data for Moderate &amp; Low zones at each location and compare the ranges of # of visitors.

    "title": "[Question] What statistical method should I use for my situation?",
    "content": "I originally posted on askstatistics, but was told that my question might be too complex, so I thought I'd ask here instead.\n\nI am collecting behavioral data over a period of time, where an instance is recorded every time a behavior occurs. An instance can occur at any time, with some instances happening quickly after one another, and some with gaps in between.\n\nWhat I want to do is to find clusters of instances that are close enough to one another to be considered separate from the others. Clusters can be of any size, with some clusters containing 20 instances, and some containing only 3.\n\nI have read about cluster analysis, but am unsure how to make it fit my situation. The examples I find involve 2 variables, where my situation only involves counting a single behavior on a timeline. The examples I find also require me to specify my cluster size, but I want my analysis to help determine this for me and involve clusters of different sizes.\n\nThe reason why is because, in behavioral analysis, it's important to look at the antecedents and consequences of a behavior to determine its function, and for high frequency behaviors, it is better to look at the antecedent and consequences for an entire cluster of the behavior.\n\nedit:\n\nI was asked to provide more information about my specific problem. Let's say I've been asked to help a patient who engages in trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder, a type of repetitive self-harm behavior). The patient does not know why they do it. It started a few years ago, and they have been unable to stop it. An \"instance\" is defined as moving their hand to their head and applying enough force to remove at least 1 strand of hair. They do know that there are periods where the behavior occurs less than others (with maybe 1-3 minute gaps between instances), and periods where they do it almost constantly (with 1 second gaps between instances). So we know that these \"episodes\" are different somehow, but I am unsure how to define what constitutes an \"episode\".\n\nTo help them with this, I decide to do a home/community observation of them for a period of 5 hours, in order to determine the antecedents (triggers) to the episode and consequences (what occurs after the episode ends that explains why it has stopped) to an episode of hair pulling. This is essential to developing an intervention to help reduce or eliminate the behavior for the patient. We need to know when an episode \"starts\" and when it \"ends\".\n\nMy problem is, what constitutes an \"episode\"? How close together do a group of instances of the behavior have to be to be included in an episode? How much latency between instances does there need to be before I can confidently say that it is part of a new episode? This cannot be done using pure visual analysis. It's not as simple as 50 instances happen within the first hour, then an hour gap, then another 50 instances happen, where the demarkation between them would be trivial to determine. Instead, the behavior occurs to some degree at all times, making it difficult to determine when old episodes end and new episodes begin. It would be very unhelpful to view the entire 5 hour block as a single \"episode\". Clearly there are changes, but I don't know where to quantifiably determine it.\n\nIt's very important to be accurate here because if I determine the start point wrong, then I will identify the wrong trigger, and my intervention will target the wrong thing, and could potentially make the situation worse, which is very bad when the behavior is self-harm. The stakes are high enough to warrant a quantifiable approach here.",

Grading schema is a bit confusing (with three options: A &gt; B &gt; C) as basically all grades are normalized since people tend to do very bad (for example, i've got an A in Metrics II with an overall grade of 5.0) and a B in Micro II with an overall grade of (6.1).  \nMost of my grades are B, with a A in Metrics II and, unfortunately two Cs, however i am confident that i can scrape more As in the current bimesters (mainly focusing for As in Metrics III and IV).\n\nOriginally i opted for a econ PhD in Brazil as i had no intention of leaving Brazil for personal reasons, however my doctoral advisor (who is a statistician) has strongly recommend that i try to transfer to the econ Msc program and that i apply to Econ/Stat PhD programs at the US/Europe for career reasons. And that, even if i'm unable to transfer, that i should apply either way using the graduate courses + electives (i'm looking to take functionaly analysis and measure theory next year, as i'll need both for my research) grade and my research as a writing sample.\n\nTo that end, i'm currently negotiating with the econ dept bureaucracy for transfer, but if that doesn't work i'll be applying either way as my doctoral advisor has suggested. My current plan is to finish my current RA and core courses this year and dedicate the following year to electives + research and a RA that my advisor has lined up with a buddy of his from Wharton and apply sometime in 2027/2028 (i'd wish to apply later due to personal reasons).\n\nAs such, as these ideas are still in preliminary stages, i'd like more information about stats dept in Europe and some advice. How do Stats application works if i end up not managing to transfer to the Msc programme, is a master obligatory? Is there anyway to transfer from my current PhD to an european PhD (i think this is extremely unlikely), what is more relevant for application: my grades? research? rec letters?\n\nI can provide more information if it's deemed necessary, i'll be very grateful to anyone who can help :)",

My ultimate goal is to get my PhD in applied stats, and specifically I want to do research on methods or models used in humanitarian aid research, such as migration, refugee aid, etc. (Not applying directly to a PhD since I took a 2 year gap, and I did not have any research experience during my undergrad, though if you think I should try, just let me know) \n\nSince I only have my bachelor's I quite honestly don't really know what kinds of research I would be looking to do but I know it's in that category. From what I've been able to gather myself it seems like the usual \"buzzwords\" would pop up such as time series, spatial stats, Bayesian stats, etc. but I wouldn't know where to begin to niche down on the specifics. In the meantime I am trying to have Claude guide me through a mock research project on public migration data from the UNHCR and conflict data from ACLED but I'm largely treating it as a kind of review course for myself.\n\nAt some level I feel like the above isn't \"valid\" justification enough for me to want to go for these advanced degrees but quite honestly I just can't see myself doing anything else, and I've always enjoyed being a student, and I want to become a college professor some day.

First sem has probability theory, inference theory, R programming and even basic math cause I guess they don't require a very heavy math background.\n\nThis program is in Sweden and from what i can see statistics is divided into 2 disciplines:\n\nMathematical statistics - usually housed in the department of mathematics and has significant math prerequisites to get in. \n\nStatistics - housed in the department of social sciences. This is the one im going for. Courses are more along the lines of experimental design, econometrics, GLM, with some machine and bayesian learning optional courses.\n\nIn terms of my background im completing my bachelors in econometrics and have taken some basic computer science and math courses and lots of data analytics stuff.\n\nI hope to pursue a PhD afterwards, but not sure what field I want to specialize in just yet.\n\nIs this a valuable degree to get? Or should I just do a master of AI and learn cool stuff?\n\n",

All patients were recruited prospectively, potential risk factors (based on prior literature) were collected, and analysed with multivariable logistic regression. I will keep the details vague as this is still a work in progress but that shouldn't affect this discussion. \n\nThe outcome event rate was 23 out of 1000. \n\n||Adjusted OR|95% CI|p|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Baseline|*0.010*|0.005 – 0.019|&lt;0.001|\n|A|30.78|6.89 – 137.5|&lt;0.001|\n|B|*5.77*|2.17 – 15.35 |&lt;0.001 |\n|C|4.90|1.74 – 13.80|0.003|\n|D|0.971|0.946 – 0.996|0.026|\n\nI checked for multi-collinearity.

D is a continuous variable (weight). \n\n**My questions are:**\n\n* With so few events this model is inevitably fragile, am I compelled to drop some predictors?\n* One of my sensitivity analysis is Firth's penalised logistic regression which only slightly altered the figures but retained the same finding largely. \n* Bootstrapping however gave me nonsensical estimates, probably because of the very few events especially for factor A where the model suggests insignificance. This seems illogical as A is a known strong predictor.\n* Do you have suggestions for addressing this conundrum? \n\n  \nThanks a lot. \n\n  \n",

    "content": "First disclaimer not a statistician, so if this makes no sense sorry. Trying to figure out my best course of statistical analysis here.\n\nI have some analytical results from the assaying of a sample. The first analysis run was using a less sensitive analytical method. Say the detection limit (DL) for this one element, eg Potassium, is 0.5ppm using the less sensitive method. We decided to run a secondary analysis using the same sample pulps on a much more sensitive method where the detection limit is 0.01ppm for the exact same element (K) but using this different method.\n\nWhen the results were received it was noticed that anything between the DL and 10x DL for the first method the results were wildly varied between the two types of analysis. See table\n\n|Sample ID|Method 1 (0.5ppm DL)|Method 2 (0.01ppm DL)|Difference|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|0.8|0.6|0.2|\n|2|0.7|0.49|0.21|\n|3|0.6|0.43|0.17|\n|4|1.8|3.76|\\-1.96|\n|5|1.4|0.93|0.47|\n|6|0.6|0.4|0.2|\n|7|0.5|0.07|0.43|\n|8|0.5|0.48|0.02|\n|9|0.7|0.5|0.2|\n|10|0.5|0.14|0.36|\n|11|0.7|0.44|0.26|\n|12|0.5|0.09|0.41|\n|13|0.5|0.43|0.07|\n|14|0.9|0.88|0.02|\n|15|4.7|0.15|4.55|\n|16|0.9|0.81|0.09|\n|17|0.5|0.33|0.17|\n|18|1.2|0.99|0.21|\n|19|1|1|0|\n|20|1.3|0.91|0.39|\n|21|0.7|1.25|\\-0.55|\n\nThen continued to look at another element analyzed in the assay and noticed that the two method results were much more similar despite the sample parameters (results between the DL and 10x the DL). For this element, say Phosphorus, the DL is 0.05ppm for the more sensitive analysis and 0.5ppm for the less sensitive analysis.\n\n\n\n|Sample ID|Method 1 (0.5ppm DL)|Method 2 (0.05ppm DL)|Difference|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|1.5|1.49|\\-0.01|\n|2|1.4|1.44|0.04|\n|3|1.5|1.58|0.08|\n|4|1.7|1.76|0.06|\n|5|1.6|1.62|0.02|\n|6|0.5|0.47|\\-0.03|\n|7|0.5|0.53|0.03|\n|8|0.5|0.49|\\-0.01|\n|9|0.5|0.48|\\-0.02|\n|10|0.5|0.46|\\-0.04|\n|11|0.5|0.47|\\-0.03|\n|12|0.5|0.47|\\-0.03|\n|13|0.5|0.51|0.01|\n|14|0.5|0.53|0.03|\n|15|0.5|0.51|0.01|\n|16|1.5|1.48|\\-0.02|\n|17|1.8|1.86|0.06|\n|18|2|1.9|\\-0.1|\n|19|1.8|1.77|\\-0.03|\n|20|1.9|1.84|\\-0.06|\n|21|0.8|0.82|0.02|\n\n\n\nFor this element there is about 360 data points that are similar as the table but kept it brief for the sake of reddit.\n\nMy question, what is the best statistical analysis to proceed with here. I want to basically go through the results and highlight the elements where the difference between the two methods is negligible (see table 2) and where the difference is quite varied (table 1) to apply caution when using the analytical results for further analysis.\n\nNow some of this data is normally distributed but most of it is not. For the most part, most of the data (&gt;90%) runs at or near the detection limit with outlier high kicks (think heavy right skewed data).\n\nAny help to get me on the right path is appreciated.\n\nLet me know if some other information is needed\n\n \n\nCheers\n\n|| || |||| ||||",

    "content": "Hey I am writing my bachelor in biology, I do like math and am (relative to other bios) quite good at it but wanted to make sure my approach does make sense.\n\n I am working with spatial point patterns in 2D, and am using the quadrat test to check for complete spatial randomness (CSR). This test divides a big rectangle (sample) into little rectangeles, counts the amount of points per rectangle and does a chi squared test to compare if this follows a poisson distribution. Under CSR this should be the case. The amount and size of rectangles can be chosen manually and is (according to gemini) a big challenge and limitation to the test. \n\nSince its using chi squared test, gemini told me it makes sense to have at least 5 expected points per rectangle. I will probably go for 10 expected points per rectangle, this is completely arbitrary though. It feels like it makes sense to have it be twice of what the minimum should be but it still is arbitrary. \n\nR only allows me to change the amount of squares, not the size (I think). I am working in R studio with the spatstat package. \n\n  \nI have a big rectangle with sidelengths a (horizontal) and b (vertical) and Np (amount of points). \n\na\\*b gives me the Area (A), the number of rectangels (Nr) should be 1/10 of Np\n\n  \nNx is the amount of rectangles on the horizontal axis, Ny corresponds to the vertical axis\n\nNr should be equal to Nx\\*Ny.\n\nI think it makes sense to have the ratio of the little rectangels be the same as the big rectangle, otherwise I think the test would be more sensitive towards changes in one direction than the other. \n\nSo:     Nx \\* Ny = Nr   and  Ny = Nx \\* a/b\n\nNx \\* (Nx \\* a/b) =  Nr\n\nNx\\^2 \\* a/b = Nr\n\nNx = sqrt(Nr\\*b/a)\n\nNy = Nx \\* a/b\n\n  \nIm pretty confident that the calculation is correct (but please correct me if not), my question is more about the approach. Does it make sense to  have an expected amount of 10 points per rectangle, and does it make sense to not go for squares with sidelength sqrt(Nr) but to go for rectangels that have the same ratio as the big rectangel, the sample?\n\nAny feedback is appreciated\n\n",

    "content": "I am working on drug response data from approximately 30 samples. For each sample, I also have clinical and genetic data and I'm interested in finding associations between drug response and clinical/genetic features. I would also like to perform a cluster analysis to see possible clustering. However, the samples have been tested with two batches of the compound plates (approximately half the patients for each batch), and I do notice statistically significant differences between the two batches for some of the compounds, although not all (Mann-Whitney U, p &lt; 0.01).\n\nEach sample was tested with about 50 compounds, with 5 concentrations, in duplicate; and my raw data is a fluorescence value related to how many cells survived, in a range of 0 to let's say 40k fluorescence units. I use these datapoints to fit a four-parameter log-logistic function, then from this interpolation I determine the area under the curve, and I express this as a percentage of the maximum theoretical area (with a few modifications, such as 100-x to express data as inhibition, but that's the gist of it). So I end up with a final AUC% value that's bound between the values of 0% AUC (no cells died even at the strongest concentration) and 100% AUC (all cells died at the weakest concentration). The data is not normally distributed, and certain weaker compounds never show values above 10% AUC.\n\nTo test for associations between drug response and genetic alterations, I opted to perform a stratified Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, using the [wilcox\\_test function from R's 'coin' package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/coin/coin.pdf) (formula: `compound ~ alteration | batch`). For specific comparisons where one of the batches had 0 samples for one group, I dropped the batch and only used data from the other batch with both groups present. Is this a reasonable approach?\n\nI would also like, if possible, to actually harmonize the AUC values across the two batches, for example in order to perform cluster analysis. But I find it hard to wrap my head around options for this. Due to the range 0-100 I would think that methods such as ComBat might not be amenable. And I do know that clinical/genetic characteristics can be associated with the data, but I have a vast amount of these variables, most of them sparse, so... I could try to model the data, but I feel that I'm damned if I do include a selection of the less sparse clin/genetic variables and damned if I don't.\n\nAt the moment I'm performing clustering without batch harmonization - I first remove drugs with low biological activity (AUC%), then rescale the remaining ones to 0-100 of their max activity, and transform to a sample-wise Z-score. I do see interesting data, but I want to do the right thing here, also expecting possible questions from reviewers. I would appreciate any feedback.",

    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’ve been reading about how bad response rates are for traditional election polls (&lt;5%), and it makes me wonder if weighting those tiny samples can really save them. From what I understand, the usual trick is to adjust for things like education or past vote, but at some point it feels like you’re just stretching a very small, weird sample way too far.\n\nI came across Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification (MRP) as an alternative. The idea seems to be:\n\n* fit a model on the small survey to learn relationships between demographics/behavior and vote choice,\n* combine that with census/voter file data to build a synthetic electorate,\n* then project the model back onto the full population to estimate results at the state/district level.\n\nApparently it’s been pretty accurate in past elections, but I’m not sure how robust it really is.\n\nSo my question is: for those of you who’ve actually used MRP (in politics or elsewhere), is it really a game-changer compared to heavy weighting? Or does it just come with its own set of assumptions/problems (like model misspecification or bad population files)?\n\nThanks!",

    "content": "There are at least a dozen different ways to calculate the average of a set of nasty real world data. But none, that I know of, is in accord with what we intuitively think of as \"average\".\n\nThe mean as a definition of \"average\" is too sensitive to outliers. For example consider the positive half of the Cauchi distribution (Witch of Agnesi). The mode is zero, median is 1 and the mean diverges logarithmically to infinity as the number of sample points increases.\n\nThe median as a definition of \"average\" is too sensitive to quantisation. For example the data 0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1 has mode 1, median 1 and mean 0.555...\n\nGiven than both mean and median can be expressed as weighted averages, I was wondering if there was a known \"ideal\" method for weighted averages that both minimises the effects of outliers and handles quantisation?\n\nI can define \"ideal\". The weighted average is sum(w_i x_i)/sum(w_i) for n &gt;= i &gt;= 1 Let x_0 be the pre-guessed mean. The x_i are sorted in ascending order. The weight w_i can be a function of either (i - n/2) or (x_i - x_0) or both.\n\nThe x_0 is allowed to be iterated. From a guessed weighted average we get a new weighted mean which is fed back in as the next x_0.\n\n*The \"ideal\" weighting is the definition of w_i where the scatter of average values decreases as rapidly as possible as n increases.*\n\nAs clunky examples of weighted averaging, the mean is defined by w_i = 1 for all i.\n\nThe median is defined as w_i = 1 for i = n/2, w_i = 1/2 for i = (n-1)/2 and i = (n+1)2, and w_i = 0 otherwise.\n\nOther clunky examples of weighted averaging are a mean over the central third of values (loses some accuracy when data is quantised). Or getting the weights from a normal distribution (how?). Or getting the weights from a norm other than the L_2 norm to reduce the influence of outliers (but still loses some accuracy with outliers).\n\nSimilar thinking for slope and extrapolation. Some weighted averaging that always works and gives a good answer (the cubic smoothing spline and the logistic curve come to mind for extrapolation).\n\nTo summarise, is there a best weighting strategy for \"weighted mean\"?",

    "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’m trying to understand if two survival comparison study designs I’m contemplating would be at risk of immortal time bias between the comparison groups. I understand the concept of ITB, but given it’s complexity I want to double check my reasoning:\n\n\nStudy 1:\n\nA cohort of cancer patients all receive the same therapy, treatment A after disease diagnosis. At various times prior to or during treatment, the patients receive genetic testing to determine whether they have mutation X or not. *Patients who die or for some reason don’t get testing to determine mutation status are removed from the study.* Assume no difference in the distribution of testing times in relation to treatment start time between those patients with and without the mutation. Presence or absence of mutation X does not impact patient treatment decisions (e.g, if a patient was known to have mutation X prior to treatment initiation, they would still receive treatment A). \n\n**If I were to compare the overall survival rates of patients on treatment A with and without mutation X (again, all treated with the same treatment A), with survival time starting at the initiation of treatment, would I be introducing ITB between the groups?**\n\n\nStudy 2:\n\nNow we have a cohort of cancer patients in which one group gets treatment A and one gets treatment B. Assume that for all patients, treatment starts at equivalent times after diagnosis. Like with study 1, at various times prior to or during treatment, the patients receive genetic testing to determine whether they have mutation X or not, and again patients that receive no testing are excluded from the study. Again, presence or absence of mutation X does not  impact patient treatment (treatment A/B is decided agnostic of any testing information).\n\n**If I were to compare overall survival between patients who received treatment A and those who received treatment B, restricted to just patients with mutation X, with survival time starting at the initiation of treatment, would I be introducing ITB between groups due to not limiting my cohort to those that received mutation testing _before_ treatment?**\n\n\nIn both cases, my interpretation is that ITB may be introduced, but NOT due to a non-standard testing time (e.g. patients might find out they are mutation X positive 5 days before treatment or 50 days after treatment begins). But I really appreciate any feedback anyone might have!",

In that case though, I would be thinking of it as the expected value because long run convergence matters.\n\nIf we're talking about anything where you're not repeatedly sampling from the same distribution, it seems like the median is always better. My reasoning being, if you have a skewed distribution, the median will give you a value that is \"more typical\" of any possible value. If you have a symmetric distribution, the mean and the median are pretty much equal, so just use the median here too. \n\nIn any case, simply always using the median eliminates any uncertainty about if the distribution is too skewed or symmetric enough for the mean.

We collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model  \nof human coin tossing developed by Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery (DHM; 2007). The model asserts  \nthat when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started. Our data support this  \nprediction: the coins landed on the same side more often than not, Pr(same side) = 0.508, 95% credible  \ninterval (CI) \\[0.506, 0.509\\], BFsame-side bias = 2359. Furthermore, the data revealed considerable between-  \npeople variation in the degree of this same-side bias. Our data also confirmed the generic prediction that  \nwhen people flip an ordinary coin—with the initial side-up randomly determined—it is equally likely to  \nland heads or tails:Pr(heads) = 0.500, 95% CI \\[0.498, 0.502\\], BF heads-tails bias = 0.182. Additional analyses  \nrevealed that the within-people same-side bias decreased as more coins were flipped, an effect that is  \nconsistent with the possibility that practice makes people flip coins in a less wobbly fashion. Our data  \ntherefore provide strong evidence that when some (but not all) people flip a fair coin, it tends to land on the same side it started. Supplementary materials for this article are available online, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work.\n\n  \n\\*My note: BF = Bayesian factor\\*",

    "title": "[Q] Chapter 2, Question 22: A First Course in Probability, Ross",
    "content": "Hi all, could anyone help me solve this problem:\n\n**Each of 52 people are given a deck of cards, which they are asked to shuffle independent of each other. What is the probability that**\n\n**(a) the order of the cards in each shuffled deck is unique?**\n\n**(b) there is exactly one card that occupies the same position in the shuffled decks received from all 52 persons?**\n\n**(c) all cards occupy the same position in all the shuffled decks?**\n\n# Here is the way I solved it:\n\n**a)** P(all decks have unique positioning of cards) = # of ways 52 decks can be shuffled in in a unique order / # of ways orderings for 52 decks that are shuffled\n\nLets look at an example:\n\nSay we have a deck that includes the cards: A, B, C And we have 2 decks (or 2 people).\n\nThe first deck can be positioning in 3\\*2\\*1 ways which includes:\n\nABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA. We choose one of these ways =&gt; 3\\*2\\*1 C 1 = 3\\*2\\*1\n\nThat leaves us with 3\\*2\\*1 - 1 choices for our second deck. So it also chooses one.\n\nSo this means that for every positioning that person 1 chooses for deck 1, we have 3\\*2\\*1 - 1 choices for our second deck. Meaning (3\\*2\\*1)(3\\*2\\*1 - 1) ways to get a unique ordering.\n\nExtending this to the problem at hand, we end up with (52!)(52! - 1)(52! - 2)... (52! - 51) = .\n\nThe total number of ways the 52 decks can be shuffled is (52!)\\^52. That is, every deck containing the 52 cards has 52 positions to fill so and the first position has 52 options, second position has 51 and so on. Leading to 52! positions for 1 deck. Since there is no constraint on the ordering of all the decks, all of them have the same positioning option.\n\nThis means:\n\nP(all decks have unique positioning of cards) = # of ways 52 decks can be shuffled in in a unique order / # of ways orderings for 52 decks that are shuffled = \\[(52!)(52! - 1)(52! - 2)... (52! - 51)\\] / (52!)\\^52 .\n\nBut the books answer is: (a) ∏ᵢ₌₁⁵¹ 1 / \\[52·51·...·(52 − i + 1)\\], (b) (52 × 52 × 51! × ... × 2! × 1!) / (52!)⁵², (c) 1 / (52!)⁵¹. I feel confident in my answer and do not know where I could have gone wrong. Can someone help me please?\n\nAlso for **(b)**, here is my work:\n\nWe can take a simple example. again imagine a deck containing 4 cards: A, B, C, D.\n\nAnd 4 people that have a deck of their own.\n\nEach person must have a card in the same position. Since there are 4 cards, we must first choose a card to maintain in a position. We have 4 options for this.\n\nNow we must now choose the position for that card. We have 4 options.\n\nTotal, we have 4 position \\* 4 distinct cards choices of a specific card in a specific location. This leaves us with 3 spaces to populate with the 3 other cards. Similar to what we did for (a), each the remaining positions will result in 3! ways to sort them. But this is the case only for the first deck since the others must have different positions other than the common card in the same position we picked above.\n\nSo like we did in (a), we choose one of these options (3! options) and the next deck will have 1 fewer options (3! - 1), ..., last deck having (3! - 2) options (since we have 4 decks aka 4 people).\n\nSo in total we have 4 \\* 4 \\* (3!) \\* (3! - 1) \\* (3! - 2).\n\nSimilarly for the problem above, we will have: 52 \\* 52 \\* (51!) \\* (51! - 1) \\* (51! - 2) \\* ... \\* (51! - 50)\n\nAs we know from (a), the total possibilities are (52!)⁵².\n\nSo the P(there is exactly one card that occupies the same position in the shuffled decks received from all 52 persons) = \\[52 \\* 52 \\* (51!) \\* (51! - 1) \\* (51! - 2) \\* ... \\* (51! - 50)\\] / (52!)⁵².\n\nBut the answer in the book is (52 × 52 × 51! × ... × 2! × 1!) / (52!)⁵².\n\nFor **(c)**, I understand the result and got the same answer from the book. For (a) and (b), I think the book's answers are a mistake but I also looked on [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3969570/rosss-probability-10th-edition-chapter-2-question-22](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3969570/rosss-probability-10th-edition-chapter-2-question-22)\n\nand it still doesn't make sense how people are getting the answer in the book and why my answer is incorrect.\n\nCan someone please help me out? Thank you so much in advance. I posted here once before and really appreciated the help especially as a newbie, thank you all.\n\n  \nEDIT: \n\nAlso, I'm not sure if the book's answer to (a) even makes sense. ∏ᵢ₌₁⁵¹ 1 / \\[52·51·...·(52 − i + 1)\\] would be very small, essentially zero meaning that the this scenario is very unlikely. But that doesn't make sense.",

Even menial jobs like construction, when backed by unions, have more job security and potential pay benefits.\n\nSo sometimes I feel like I'm torturing myself learning abstract stuff like Bayesian and R programming language - the countless hours put in, for such \"intellectual\" stuff, only to be met with lower pay, longer working hours, and less job security (rise of AI, outsourcing to cheap remote workers, oversaturation etc).\n\n1. Is my perspective fair? I mean, don't get me wrong, I enjoy the theory part of what I study in terms of subject, like the biological influence of hormones...but the hours put into stats / programming / coding...and the emotional pressure to get an A...it feels like the effort-reward ratio isn't making sense.\n\n2. Is it just me, or is it simply a pride thing? As in, people are conditioned to pursue academia and higher learning because society looks down on manual labour when they actually earn more, are subject to less stress, and have higher job security.

If I take a book on statistics, will it cover probability too? Or are they different things? Do I need to take another book about probability as well?\n\nI was watching at statistics related courses on math college degrees and I saw they do several semesters worth of courses, and they study things like regressions and stuff like that outside the main statistics course later in the degree.\n\nIn case I finish the book, how can I know which topics hasn't it covered to expand with other resources?\n\nI was looking at the books Learning Statistics with R and Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists. These two books cover many topics, how can I know which isn't covered? Does the fact that the first book doesn't mention probability mean that isn't covered?\n\nSorry for the messy post, I guess my main question is what are the different subtopics that I need to cover to make sure I didn't miss any major topic in this field? I'm scared I'll read a book about probability and it won't cover stuff like regressions because it's another topic.",

    "title": "Bayesian optimization [E] [R]",
    "content": "Despite being a Bayesian method, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is largely dominated by computer scientists and optimization researchers, not statisticians. Most theoretical work centers on deriving new acquisition strategies with no-regret guarantees rather than improving the statistical modeling of the objective function. The Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate of the underlying objective is often treated as a fixed black box, with little attention paid to the implications of prior misspecification, posterior consistency, or model calibration.\n\nThis division might be due to a deeper epistemic difference between the communities. Nonetheless, the statistical structure of the surrogate model in BO is crucial to its performance, yet seems to be underexamined.\n\nThis seems to create an opportunity for statisticians to contribute. In theory, the convergence behavior of BO is governed by how quickly the GP posterior concentrates around the true function, which is controlled directly by the choice of kernel. Regret bounds such as those in the canonical GP-UCB framework (which assume the latent function are in the RKHS of the kernel -- i.e, no misspecification) are driven by something called the maximal information gain, which depends on the eigenvalue decay of the kernel’s integral operator but also the RKHS norm of the latent function. Faster eigenvalue decay and better kernel alignment with the true function class yield tighter bounds and better empirical performance.\n\nIn practice, however, most BO implementations use generic Matern or RBF kernels regardless of the structure of the objective; these impose strong and often inappropriate assumptions (e.g., stationarity, isotropy, homogeneity of smoothness). Domain knowledge is rarely incorporated into the kernel, though structural information can dramatically reduce the effective complexity of the hypothesis space and accelerate learning.\n\nMy question is, is there an opening for statistical expertise to improve both theory and practice?",

    "content": "I am working with approximate Gaussian Processes with Stan, but I have non-Euclidean distance matrices. These distance matrices come from theory-internal motivations, and there is really no way of changing that (for example the cophenetic distance of a tree). Now, approx GP algorithm takes the Euclidean distance between between observations in 2 dimensions. My question is: What is the least bad/best dimensionality reduction technique I should be using here?\n\nI have tried regular MDS, but when comparing the orignal distance matrix to the distance matrix that results from it, it seems quite weird. I also tried stacked auto encoders, but the model results make no sense.\n\nThanks!",

    "content": "I'm following a one-stage pooling approach using two complex surveys (Argentina's national drug use surveys from 2020 and 2022) to analyze Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) by mode of cannabis consumption. Pooling is necessary due to low response counts in key variables, which makes it impossible to fit my model separately by year.\n\nThe issue is that the 2020 survey, affected by COVID, has only 10 PSUs, while 2022 has about 900 PSUs. Other than that, the surveys share structure and methodology.\n\nSo far, I’ve:\n\n* Harmonized the datasets and divided the weights by 2 (number of years pooled).\n* Created combined strata using year and geographic area.\n* Assigned unique PSU IDs.\n* Used bootstrap replication for variance and confidence interval estimation.\n* Performed sensitivity analyses, comparing estimates and proportions between years — trends remain consistent.\n\nStill, I'm concerned about the validity of variance estimation due to the extremely low number of PSUs in 2020.  \nIs there anything else I can do to address this problem more rigorously?\n\nLooking for guidance on best practices when pooling complex surveys with such extreme PSU imbalance.",

While the model performs well in simulations, I'm trying to evaluate it on real datasets — and that's where I'm facing a challenge.\n\nIn every real dataset I’ve tried so far, the quadratic term doesn't seem to have a significant impact, and in some cases, the linear model actually performs better. 😞\n\nFor context, the Tecator dataset shows a notable improvement when incorporating a quadratic term compared to the linear version. This dataset contains the absorbance spectrum of meat samples measured with a spectrometer. For each sample, there is a 100-channel spectrum of absorbances, and the goal is typically to predict fat, protein, and moisture content. The absorbance is defined as the negative base-10 logarithm of the transmittance. The three contents — measured in percent — are determined via analytical chemistry.\n\nI'm wondering if you happen to know of any other real datasets similar to Tecator where the quadratic term might provide a meaningful improvement. Or maybe you have some intuition or guidance that could help me identify promising use cases.\n\nSo far, I’ve tested several audio-related datasets (e.g., fake vs. real speech, female vs. male voices, emotion classification), thinking the quadratic term might highlight certain frequency interactions, but unfortunately, that hasn't worked out as expected.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

    "content": "Hi, I need help in assessing the admission statistics of a selective public school that has an admission policy based on test scores and catchment areas. \n\nThe school has defined **two catchment areas (namely A and B)**, where catchment A is a smaller area close to the school and catchment B is a much wider area, also **including A**. Catchment A is given a certain degree of preference in the admission process. Catchment A is a more expensive area to live in, so I am trying to gauge how much of an edge it gives.\n\nKey policy and past data are as follows:\n\n- Admission to Einstein Academy is solely based on performance in our admission tests. Candidates are ranked in order of their achieved mark.     \n- There are **2** assessment stages. Only successful stage 1 sitters will be invited to sit stage 2. The mark achieved in stage 2 will determine their fate.\n- There are 180 school places available.\n- Up to **60** places go to candidates whose mark is higher than the **350th** ranked mark of all stage 2 sitters and whose residence is in **Catchment A**.  \n- Remaining places go to candidates in Catchment B (which includes A) based on their stage 2 test scores.\n- Past 3year averages: 1500 stage 1 candidates, of which 280 from Catchment A; 480 stage 2 candidates, of which 100 from Catchment A\n\nMy logic:\n- assuming all candidates are equally able and all marks are randomly distributed; big assumption, just a start\n- 480/1500 move on to stage2, but catchment doesn't matter here       \n- in stage 2, catchment A candidates (100 of them) get a priority place (up to 60) by simply beating the 27th percentile (above 350th mark out of 480)\n- probability of having a mark above 350th mark is 73% (350/480), and there are 100 catchment A sitters, so 73 of them are expected eligible to fill up all the 60 priority places. With the remaining 40 moved to compete in the larger pool.    \n- *expectedly*, 420 (480 - 60) sitters (from both catchment A and B) compete for the remaining 120 places\n- P(admission | catchment A) = P(passing stage1) * [ P(above 350th mark)P(get one of the 60 priority places) + P(above 350th mark)P(not get a priority place)P(get a place in larger pool) + P(below 350th mark)P(get a place in larger pool)] = (480/1500) * [ (350/480)(60/100) + (350/480)(40/100)(120/420) + (130/480)(120/420) ] = 19%\n- P(admission | catchment B) = (480/1500) * (120/420) = 9%\n- Hence, the edge of being in catchment A over B is about 10%",

To simplify, we have Y1\\_pre, Y2\\_pre, Y1\\_post, Y2\\_post, and other covariates like location\\_id, gender ...\n\nWhat I think we can use:\n\n* DiD: Need to panelize the data so we can have model like: Y1 \\~ treatment\\*post or Y2 \\~ treatment\\*post. Those covariates like location and gender are fixed so it might not useful for DiD. However this assumes  parallel trend and it's pretty hard to validate. Some may also argue parallel trend among location is likely unmet due to different in geo. \n* ANCOVA: Simply put regression on Y1\\_post \\~ Y1\\_pre + Y2\\_pre + treatment + C(location, gender) or Y2\\_post \\~ Y1\\_pre + Y2\\_pre + treatment + C(location, gender). Yes, some might argue the interaction term among variables are not common for ANCOVA. But then this assumes the linear relationship among Y1\\_post vs Y1\\_pre, Y2\\_pre ... \n* Propensity Score matching (PSM): No regression, but tried to balance among groups. However, the balance might still has bias due to we can't guarantee all covariates are being matched. And it's hard to include everything too.\n\nGot a result quite different among 3 methods. PSM seems overestimating as it doesn't eliminate the bias while matching completely. The other model get results quite close (but still different).\n\nIn this case, should I trust DiD?

Also the data file (text file) is downloadable there so you can play around with it too).\n\nAt first, yes it appeared random to me, but I toyed with the numbers a bit by various sorts, playing with sets etc.. and I noticed something:\n\n1. Using the data that they posted on their site, I took a count of the frequency of appearances of a number (between 0 and 250). That came up with their graph, which makes sense..\n2. I sorted the frequencies then plotted the graph from the sorted freqiencies, which appears much like an x³ graph of sorts (I took a screen grab of the graph I plotted in excel here: [https://i.imgur.com/aiUAAwx.png](https://i.imgur.com/aiUAAwx.png) )\n\nI would have assumed that given that due to the nature of it being a true random generation of numbers, that the frequency too would be random too or is there something that I'm missing in statistics or something else?\n\nI found this really interesting...",

Things like i.i.d, expectation etc in detail. Khan academy was helpful but i believe i should have some rigorous study material alongside it. I don't wanna get feed the same content over and over again by random youtube videos. So what would you suggest.

I'm a Social Sciences student in Brazil, and I think I have what would be called a \"dumb question\" in parts for the lack of a good formation in statistics during my undergrad.\n\nSo... Let's say I have n = 131, and I have these two ordinal variables, and I'm testing linear correlation (Pearson) and monotonic relationship (Spearman) between them. Testing the null hypothesis, I get a p-value of 0.06 for Pearson and .07 for Spearman, what would indicate to discard the null hypothesis. I know that, if I test the positive hypothesis, those p-values will be the half (0.03 and 0.04, respectively), what is below the \"statistically significant\" value of 0.05. Should I, in my write, just say that the null hypothesis could not be discarded 'cause p-value is greater than 0.05 or, if I have some *a priori* reasons to believe the two variables are positively correlated, I could as well present the test for positive hypothesis (given the p-value, in this case, would be less than 0.05)?\n\nThank you all in advance!",

I've been out of undergrad for 3 years, wherein I've been teaching middle school math while completing an MS in Secondary Math Education. I actually love teaching (I know... middle school AND math? Shocker!) and I want to continue with it as a career. That being said, I want to enter higher education. Before, I thought I'd do a PhD, but as someone nearing the end of my MS, I've realized I had no idea what I'd want to research at all. Now that I have savings and feel somewhat economically ok, I've realized I want to go back to graduate school and get a Master's in Statistics... or some kind of Data Analytics. I learned R in college, and took classes on Linear Regression, Categorical Data, Machine Learning, Econometrics, etc, for my minor, as well as Linear Algebra, Physics, and all the required math classes for Economics. I'm definitely rusty, but I really love statistics, primarily where it intersects with social sciences, research, and data analytics (I LOVE showing my kids how what they're learning aligns with what I learned. My middle schoolers have seen R very frequently.). I won't lie, I struggled with the classes in college (all B's, but I really had to fight for them), and I'm afraid of being behind or failing out. I want a Masters not just for the degree but to learn more about statistics, become a more qualified math educator, have a path to enter higher education to teach,  have options outside of education, better develop my logic and coding skills, and be more qualified and vocationally desirable (I guess). I've looked up programs for Statistics, but they vary everywhere. I love research and the intersection of statistics with social sciences. Machine Learning, I'm sorry to say, is not my thing. I'd love some advice or recommendations. I'm meeting with my undergrad career center soon. Thanks !!!",

I want to do multiple linear regression analyses to analyse the association between Y and X (and some covariates such as sex, age and medication use etc), but the literature on how to handle ordinal predictors is a bit too overwhelming for me. Ordinal logistic regression (swithing X and Y) is not an option, since the research question and perspective changes too much in that way. A few questions regarding this topic:\n\n- Can I choose to treat this ordinal predictor as a continuous predictor? If so, what are some arguments generally in favor of doing so (quite a few categories for example)?\n\n- If I were to treat it as a continous predictor, how can I statistically test beforehand whether this is an‘’okay’’ thing to do (I work with Rstudio)? I’m reading about comparing AIC levels and such..\n\n- If that is not possible, which of the methods (of handeling ordinal predictors) is most used and accepted in clinical research?\n\nThank you in advance for your help and feedback!\n\nWith kind regards",

In this case, the disruption period length is 19 months (from month 26 to 44), but I have other datasets with different lockdown durations, and I hypothesize that longer lockdowns may have different impacts than shorter ones.\n\nWhat's the appropriate way to incorporate known disruption duration into the analysis?\n\n  \nA little bit of context:\n\nThis is my approach for testing whether lockdown duration contributes to the magnitude of impact on nighttime lights (column ba in the shared df) during the lockdown period (knotsNum).\n\n  \nThat's how I fitted the linear model for the during period without adding the length of the disruption period:\n\n    pre_data &lt;- df[df$monthNum &lt; knotsNum[1], ]\n    during_data &lt;- df[df$monthNum &gt;= knotsNum[1] &amp; df$monthNum &lt;= knotsNum[2], ]\n    post_data &lt;- df[df$monthNum &gt; knotsNum[2], ]\n    \n    during_model &lt;- lm(ba ~ monthNum, data = during_data)\n    summary(during_model)\n\nHere is my dataset:\n\n    &gt; dput(df)\n    structure(list(ba = c(75.5743196350863, 74.6203366002096, 73.6663535653328, \n    72.8888364886628, 72.1113194119928, 71.4889580670178, 70.8665967220429, \n    70.4616902716411, 70.0567838212394, 70.8242795722238, 71.5917753232083, \n    73.2084886381771, 74.825201953146, 76.6378322273966, 78.4504625016473, \n    80.4339255221286, 82.4173885426098, 83.1250549660005, 83.8327213893912, \n    83.0952494240052, 82.3577774586193, 81.0798739040064, 79.8019703493935, \n    78.8698515342936, 77.9377327191937, 77.4299978963597, 76.9222630735257, \n    76.7886470146215, 76.6550309557173, 77.4315783782333, 78.2081258007492, \n    79.6378781206591, 81.0676304405689, 82.5088809638169, 83.950131487065, \n    85.237523842823, 86.5249161985809, 87.8695954274008, 89.2142746562206, \n    90.7251944966818, 92.236114337143, 92.9680912967979, 93.7000682564528, \n    93.2408108610688, 92.7815534656847, 91.942548368634, 91.1035432715832, \n    89.7131675379257, 88.3227918042682, 86.2483383318464, 84.1738848594247, \n    82.5152280388184, 80.8565712182122, 80.6045637522384, 80.3525562862646, \n    80.5263796870851, 80.7002030879055, 80.4014140664706, 80.1026250450357, \n    79.8140166545202, 79.5254082640047, 78.947577740372, 78.3697472167393, \n    76.2917760563349, 74.2138048959305, 72.0960610901764, 69.9783172844223, \n    67.8099702791755, 65.6416232739287, 63.4170169813438, 61.1924106887589, \n    58.9393579024253), monthNum = 0:71), class = \"data.frame\", row.names = c(NA, \n    -72L))\n\nThe disruption period:\n\n`knotsNum &lt;- c(26,44)`\n\nSession info:\n\n    &gt; sessionInfo()\n    R version 4.5.1 (2025-06-13 ucrt)\n    Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64\n    Running under: Windows 11 x64 (build 26100)\n    \n    Matrix products: default\n      LAPACK version 3.12.1\n    \n    locale:\n    [1] LC_COLLATE=English_United States.utf8  LC_CTYPE=English_United States.utf8    LC_MONETARY=English_United States.utf8\n    [4] LC_NUMERIC=C                           LC_TIME=English_United States.utf8    \n    \n    time zone:\n    tzcode source: internal\n    \n    attached base packages:\n    [1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     \n    \n    loaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n    [1] compiler_4.5.1    tools_4.5.1       rstudioapi_0.17.1",

Essentially, I am deciding between a PhD in Statistics (or perhaps data science?) vs a PhD in a field of interest. For background, I am a computational science major and a statistics minor at a T10. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my statistics and programming coursework thus far, and want to pursue graduate education in something related. I am most interested in spatial and geospatial data when applied to the sciences (think climate science, environmental research, even public health etc.).\n\n  \nMy main issue is that I don't want to do theoretical research. I'm good with learning the theory behind what I'm doing, but it's just not something I want to contribute to. In other words, I do not really want to  partake in any method development that is seen in most mathematics and statistics departments. My itch comes from wanting to apply statistics and machine learning to real-life, scientific problems.\n\n  \nHere are my pros of a statistics PhD:\n\n\\- I want to keep my options open after graduation. I'm scared that a PhD in a field of interest will limit job prospects, whereas a PhD in statistics confers a lot of opportunities.\n\n\\- I enjoy the idea of statistical consulting when applied to the natural sciences, and from what I've seen, you need a statistics PhD to do that\n\n\\- better salary prospects\n\n\\- I really want to take more statistics classes, and a PhD would grant me the level of mathematical rigor I am looking for\n\n  \nCons and other points:\n\n\\- I enjoy academia and publishing papers and would enjoy being a professor if I had the opportunity, but I would want to publish in the sciences.\n\n\\- I have the ability to pursue a 1-year Statistics masters through my school to potentially give me a better foundation before I pursue a PhD in something else.\n\n\\- I don't know how much real analysis I actually want to do, and since the subject is so central to statistics, I fear it won't be right for me\n\n  \nTLDR: how do I combine a love for both the natural sciences and applied statistics at the graduate level? what careers are available to me? do I have any other options I'm not considering?",

    "content": "Hello! I’ve recently started thinking about applying for a PhD in Statistics, and would love some advice about how I could prepare myself. My academic interests have focused a lot more heavily on applied sciences (biology and machine learning). I’ve never considered pursuing an PhD in theory, so I’m not sure how far of a shot I’m making. \n\nI am starting the third year of my undergraduate at MIT, and I am pursuing double majors in math and computer science. My current GPA is 5.0. \n\nI plan to complete both my bachelor’s and master’s in Spring 2027, so unless I decide to take more time, I’d likely start applying in ~1.5 year during Fall 2026. \n\nFor theory coursework, I’ve taken a graduate course in discrete probability and stochastic processes. Otherwise, my coursework is at the undergraduate level: topology, real analysis, design and analysis of algorithms, statistics, linear algebra, differential equations, and multivariable calculus. For my computer science degree, I’ve mostly just taken courses to fulfill my major requirements. In the coming year, I plan to take more graduate-level ML and theory courses!\n\nFor languages, I am familiar with Python, C, Assembly, TypeScript, Bluespec, and Verilog. I also have personal projects using the MERN stack, NextJS, Flask, and ThreeJS.\n\nI have some teaching (including UTA for real analysis) and service experience as well. \n\nOn the research side, I have two papers under review for NeurIPS 2025 (one as first author with two faculty members), but both are in applied machine learning. I have been reading Wainwright’s high dimensional statistics book and have some research ideas from papers I’ve read in sparse coding, but I am not sure where to start with gaining theory research experience because I think I would need to take more graduate statistics courses first. However, by that time, I won’t have much time to work on research before the application cycle. I really regret not working on research this summer, but am willing to work throughout the school year and next summer.\n\nAs for letter of recs, I have two advisors I can ask. One of them is quite fond of me, but would be a new faculty in a BioE department. The other is more established in computer vision, but is still a younger faculty. Additionally, I have performed well in my courses (scoring in the top 10/200+ on theory exams), but have not interacted much with the teaching professors. Do people typically reach out for non-research letter of recs?\n\nIf you suggest I take another year to apply, are there post-bacc research programs for statistics that I could consider to make myself more competitive? Otherwise, I would really like to apply to top PhD programs in statistics!\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated! Thank you so much. :-)",

But I was adviced to use populations that consist of the monthly means to avoid small sample size. But I feel like I shouldn't do that, mainly because there is clear seasonality in groudwater table depths and I don't think the monthly values are independent within the periods (deep groundwater table in June is probably often followed by deep groundwater table in July, as they depend on the weather conditions).\n\nIn other words: Is it valid in this case to use U-test for two populations consisting of monthly means and then to say \"On annual level, the mean groundwater table depths were lower in period A (p&lt;0.05)\"?\n\nI hope I was clear enough.",

Anyone can crunch a z-score and reference the statistic table on the back of the textbook, and of course that gets boring after you do it 100 times.\n\nThe sad part is that they’re not even being facetious. They genuinely believe that stats, as a discipline, is simple.\n\nI don’t really have a reply to this.

    "content": "Hi guys, I have a set of data that is roughly normal distributed if a certain parameter is sufficiently small, but the distribution becomes more and more skewed upon increasing that parameter. since the data consists of probability and they approach unity for sufficiently large choices of said parameter, at some point the distribution is so heavily skewed that the mean (and also median) are close to 1 and all the deviation left is ofc below 1. it resembles much more a gamma or exponential distribution in this realm.\n\nThe true nature of the data is hence much better captured by the median and a 50% percentil \"error\" than the usual mean plusminus standard deviation plot, as shown in the [picture](https://ibb.co/tMPym02X).\n\nI have found a formula for the moments of my desired quantity and therefore can analytically describe, say, the first and 2nd moment of the quantity, hence reproducing the plots solid line and light blue standard deviation area. Evaluating the higher moments, I could also gain information about the skewness of the quantity.\n\nNow I have two questions:\n\n* what is a way to determine wheter the data is more gamme or more exponential distributed?\n* How can I use the higher moments of my quantity to visualize not a symmentrical standard deviation as suggested by the second moment but rathar a skewd distribution as suggested by the data?\n\nI hope this makes sense and i have worded my wish properly",

It's roughly 115 features, with \\~500 observations. Not being a subject-matter expert, I didn't want to erroneously select features, so I performed LASSO regression to select features (dropping out features that had their coefficients dropped to 0).\n\nThen I performed binary logistic regression on the train data set, using only LASSO-selected features, and applied the model to my test data. However, only a 3 / 12 features selected were statistically significant.\n\nMy question is mainly: is the lack of significance among the LASSO-selected features worrisome? And is there a better way to perform feature selection than applying LASSO across the entire training dataset? I had expected, since LASSO did not drop these features out, that they would significantly contribute to one outcome or the other (may very well be a misunderstanding of the method).\n\nI saw some discussions on stackexchange about bootstrapping to help stabilize feature selection: [https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/249283/top-variables-from-lasso-not-significant-in-regular-regression](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/249283/top-variables-from-lasso-not-significant-in-regular-regression)\n\nThank you!",

    "title": "[Q] Using \"complex surveys\" for a not-complex survey, in SPSS or R survey",
    "content": "Hi all, this is a follow-up to an earlier question that a bunch of you had very helpful input on.\n\nI have reasonable stats knowledge, but in my field convenience sampling is the norm. So, using survey weights is very new to me.\n\nI am preparing to collect a sample (\\~N = 3500) from Prolific, quota-matched to US census on age, race, sex. I will use raking to create a survey weight variable, to adjust to census-type data on factors such as sex, age, race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, etc.\n\nFrom there, my first analyses will be relatively simple, such as estimating prevalences of behaviors for different age groups and sex, and then a few simple associations, such as predicting recency of behaviors from a few health indices, etc.\n\nIn my previous question here, folks recommended a few resources, such as Lumley, and https://tidy-survey-r.github.io/site/. Plus I've learned that regular SPSS cannot handle these types of survey weights properly, and I need the complex samples module added.\n\nRegardless of whether I try to figure out my next steps using R survey or SPSS Complex Samples (where I've spent most of my recent time, due to years of SPSS experience, and limited R experience),  I find myself running up against  the fact that these complex survey packages are for survey data that are far more complicated than mine. Because I am recruiting from prolific, I do not have a probability sample, no strata nor clusters; I basically have a convenience sample with cases that I want to weight to better reflect population proportions on key variables (eg, sex, age, etc.).\n\nIn SPSS complex samples, I have successfully created a raked weight variable (only on test data, but still a big win for me). Am I right that in the Complex Surveys set up procedure, I should be indicating my weight variable, no strata nor clusters (because I have none, right?)?\n\nAnd for Stage 1: Estimation Method, I should indicate a sampling design of Equal WOR (equal probability sampling without replacement)? This seems to make most sense for my situation. The next window asks me to specify inclusion probabilities, but without strata/clusters, my hunch is to enter a fixed value for inclusion probability (chatGPT suggests the same and says this won't make a difference anyway?), does this make sense? And from there, I wonder if I'm good to go? Ie, load in the plan file when I'm ready to analyze?\n\nAside from SPSS, I'm open to exploring R survey, but the learning curve is steeper there. I have simply been overwhelmed trying to figure out SPSS. Is anyone familiar enough with R packages survey or srvyr to help me get started how I'd get started there? u/[Overall\\_Lynx4363](https://www.reddit.com/user/Overall_Lynx4363/) suggested the book Exploring Complex Survey Data Analysis, whcih I have, but I've just not gone there much. Quick view of the book suggests I can create a survey design object, simple random sample without replacement, aka an “Independent Sampling design,” which has no clusters, and allows for my weight variable? From there, the relevant chapter moves into stratified and clustered designs, which is definitely irrelevant for my case?\n\nAny insights would be so much appreciated. Just trying to speed up my learning here! Thank you!",

I'm doing my masterthesis research about preferences in lgbt+bars (with Likert-scale) and my supervisor wanted me to divide respondents in groups based on their sexuality&amp;gender. However, based on the respondents I've got, this means that some groups would only have 3 members (example: bisexual men), while other groups would have around 30 members (example: homosexual men). This raises some alarm bells for me, but I don't have a statistics background so I'm not sure if that feeling is correct. Another thing is that this way of having many small groups makes it so that there would be a big number groups, so I fear the test will be less sensitive, especially for the \"post-hoc-test\" to see which of the groups differ, and that this would make some differences not statistically different in SPSS.\n\nOnline I've found the answer that a group should contain at least 5 members, one said at least 7, but others say it doesn't matter, as long as you have 2 members. I can't seem to find an academic article that's clear about this either.

    "content": "Hello, everyone. This fall, I will be a senior studying data science at a large state school and applying to my master's program. My current GPA is 3.4. I am interning as a software engineer this summer in the marketing department of the company, which has given me some perspective into the areas of statistics I am interested in, specifically the design of experiments and time series. I have also been doing research in numerical analysis for the past seven months and astrophysics for a little over a year before that.\n\nThe first few semesters of my undergrad were rough for my math grade as I didn't know what I wanted to really do with my career, but my cs/ds courses were all A's and B's. Since then, almost all the upper division courses I've taken in math/stats/cs/ds have been A's and B's, except 2 of them. I have taken the standard courses: calc 1-3, linear algebra, intro to stats, probability, data structures and algorithms, etc. On top of those, I've done numerical methods, regression analysis, Bayesian stats, mathematical stats, predictive analytics, quantitative risk management, machine learning, etc, for some of my upper-level courses, and I have gotten A's and B's in these.\n\nI believe I can get some good letters of recommendation from 3 professors, and my mentor at my internship as well. But I am not sure if I am being unrealistic with the schools that I want to apply to. I have been looking through a good spread of programs and wanted to know if I am being too ambitious. Some of the schools are: UCSB,  UCSD, Purdue, Wake Forest, Penn State, University of Iowa, Iowa State, UIUC. I think that I should lower my ambitions and maybe apply to different programs. \n\nAny and all feedback is appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

It reminds me somewhat of Casella &amp; Berger, but the pace is quicker and it doesn't shy away from more advanced mathematical tools like measure theory, metric spaces, and even some group theory. At the same time, it's not as terse or dry as Keener’s book, which I found beautiful but hard to engage with.  \n\nFor context: I have a strong background in pure mathematics (functional analysis and operator theory), holding both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree, and some PhD level courses under my belt as well. I'm now teaching myself mathematical statistics with a view toward a career in data science and possibly a PhD in applied math or machine learning.  \n\nI'm currently working through Casella &amp; Berger (as well as more applied texts like ISLP and Practical Statistics for Data Scientists), but I find C&amp;B somewhat slow and bloated for self-study. My plan is to shift to Almudevar as a main reference and use C&amp;B as a complementary source.  \n\nHas anyone here studied Almudevar’s book or navigated similar resources?

    "content": "I'm trying to figure out how to update probabilities of certain hands in Texas Hold 'em adjusted to the previous round. For example, if I draw mismatched cards, what are the odds that I have one pair after the flop? It seems to me that there are two scenarios: 3 unique cards with one matching rank with a card in the draw, or a pair with no cards in common rank with the draw, like this:\n\nDraw: a-b Flop: a-c-d or c-c-d\n\nMy current formula is \\[C(2 1)\\*C(4 2)\\*C(11 2)\\*C(4 1)\\*C(4 1) + C(11 1)\\*C(4 2)\\*C(10 1)\\*C(4 1)\\]/C(50 3)\n\nYou have one card matching rank with one of the two draw cards, (2 1), 3 possible suits (4 2), then two cards of unlike value (11 2) with 4 possible suits for each (4 1)\\*(4 1). Then, the second set would be 11 possible ranks (11 1) with 3 combinations of suits (4 2) for 2 cards with the third card being one of 10 possible ranks and 4 possible suits (10 1)(4 1). Then divide by the entire 3 cards chosen from 50 (50 3). I then get a 67% odds of improving to a pair on the flop from different rank cards in the hole.\n\nIf that does not happen and the cards read a-b-c-d-e, I then calculate the odds of improving to a pair on the turn as: C(5 1)\\*C(4 2)/C(47,1). To get a pair on the turn, you need to match rank with one of five cards, which is the (5 1) with three potential suits, (4 2), divided by 47 possible choices (47 1). This is then a 63% chance of improving to a pair on the turn.\n\nThen, if you have a-b-c-d-e-f, getting a pair on the river would be 6 possible ranks, (6 1), 3 suits, (4 2), divided by 46 possible events. C(6 1)\\*C(4 2)/C(46 1), with a 78% chance of improving to a pair on the river.\n\nThis result does not feel right, does anyone know where/if I'm going wrong with this? I haven't found a good source that explains how this works. If I recall from my statistics class a few years ago, each round of dealing would be an independent event.",

Just like in Latin Median is derived from Middle.\n\nI often see this cause confusion, especially when stats are quoted in media without context. People assume \"средно\" means \"typical\" or \"middle\", but it’s actually the arithmetic mean.\n\nSo why did we end up with this naming? Was it a conscious decision or just a historical quirk?\n\nCouldn’t it have gone the other way - creating a word based on \"средно\" for median and borrowing a word for mean instead?\n\nWould love to hear if anyone knows the background.",

I started my model by adding treatment and treatment-time interaction as a fixed effect, and subject intercept as a random effect. However, based on how my data looks, and also theory, I know that the change over time is not linear (this is very very obvious if I plot all the individual points). Therefore, I started adding polynomial terms, and here my confusion begins. I thought adding polynomial time terms to my fixed effects until they are significant (p &lt; 0.05) would be fine, however, I realized that I can go up very high polynomial terms that make no sense biologically and are clearly overfitting but still get significant p values. So, I compromised on terms that are significant but make sense to me personally (up to cubic), however, I feel like I need better justification than “that made sense to me”. In addition, I added treatment-time interactions to both the fixed and random effects, up to the same degree, because they were all significant (I used likelihood ratio test to test the random effects, but just like the other p values, I do not fully trust this), but I have no idea if this is something I should do. My underlying though process is that if there is a cubic relationship between time and whatever I am measuring, it would make sense that the treatment-time interaction and the individual slopes could also follow these non-linear relationships. \n\nI also made a Q-Q plot of my residuals, and they were quite (and equally) bad regardless of including the higher polynomial terms. \n\nI have tried to search up the appropriate way to deal with this, however, I am running into conflicting information, with some saying just add them until they are no longer significant, and others saying that this is bad and will lead to overfitting. However, I did not find any protocol that tells me objectively when to include a term, and when to leave it out. It is mostly people saying to add them if “it makes sense” or “makes the model better” but I have no idea what to make of that.\n\nI would very much appreciate if someone could advise me or guide me to some sources that explain clearly how to proceed in such situation. I unfortunately have very little background in statistics. \n\nAlso, I am not sure if it matters, but I have a small sample size (around 30 in total) but a large amount of data (100+ measurements from each subject).",

However, I’ve noticed through this sub so many people are getting a masters or doctorates in Statistics, that isn’t really something I think I would like to do, nor if I could even survive that, but is it a path that is necessary in this field? I see myself working in data analyst roles interpreting data for a company and communicating to people what it means and how to change and adapt based on it. Any advice would be useful , thx",

Feedback is more than welcomed! :)",

    "title": "[R] Theoretical (probabilistic) bounds on error for L1 and L2 regularization?",
    "content": "I'm wondering if there are any theoretical results giving probabilistic bounds the error when using L1 and/or L2 regularization on top of linear regression. Here's what I mean.\n\nLet's say we assume that we get tabular data with p explanatory variables (`x_1, ..., x_p` )and one outcome variable (`y`) and we get n data points where each data point is drawn IID from some distribution `D` such that that for each data point,\n\n`y = c_1 x_1 + ... + c_p x_p + err`\n\nwhere the err are IID from some distribution `E`.\n\nAre there any results showing that if `D`, `E`, `p`, and `n` meet certain conditions (I'm not sure what they would be) and if we estimate the `c_i` using L1 or L2 regularization with linear regression, then with some high probability, the estimates of the `c_i` will not be too different from the real `c_i`?",

    "content": "\n\nI'm not sure this is the right sub for this, but I have searched and searched various textbooks, course data, and the internet and I feel like I'm still not coming to a solid conclusion even though this is very basic level statistics.\n\nI am working on an assignment that has us working through hypothesis testing for research questions.\n\nThe research question is whether older employees are more likely to report unsafe working conditions.\n\nThe null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between age and willingness to report unsafe work.\n\nThe research hypothesis is that there is a positive correlation between age and willingness to report unsafe work.\n\nThe independent variable is age, which is ratio level.\n\nThe dependent variable is willingness to report unsafe work (scale of 0-10 in equal increments of 1 with 0 being never and 10 being always willing).\n\nMy first question is whether this is interval or ordinal. My initial thought was ordinal because while it is ranked in equal increments with hard limits (always and never) the rankings are subjective and someone's \"sometimes\" is different than someone elses, and a sometimes at 5 is not necessarily half of an always at 10.\n\nI then ran into the issue of which hypothesis test to use.\n\nI cannot use a Chi-square because this question specifies age, not age groups and our prof has been specific on using the variable indicated.\n\nA pearson's r isn't appropriate unless both variables are continuous, but it would be the most appropriate test based on the question and what is being compared which made me think maybe I am misinterpreting the level of measure and it should be interval.\n\nAny assistance or clarification on points I may be misunderstanding would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",
